<%# 

  This is a page template that brings in all articles tagged with X,
  where X is set by a page setting called 'tag'.
  
  This means that you can set up a page with the setting key 'tag' and value
  'media', for example, and this page will display all the articles with the
  tag 'media'.

  The article display can be edited in the list.tag.html.erb in CANPUB.
