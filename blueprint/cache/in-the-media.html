  <p>Historical fiction is a curious genre. In some sense, the pleasures of reading historical fiction are similar to those we gain from reading fiction set in exotic landscapes. The thrill of seeing men and women living lives in such different circumstances to our own. At times, historical fiction can become a kind of decorative art: more concerned with the mise en scene of bodices and buckram than the exploration of characters and lives, either fictional or non-fictional. Not all historical fiction is alike: some works use history as a backdrop, inventing characters and stories, like the hugely successful historical works of Sarah Waters (Fingersmith, Tipping the Velvet). Others take historical figures as a leaping off point, imagining into the gaps in the record, such as Geraldine Brooks (Year of Wonders, Calebâs Crossing), or A S Byatt, whose The Childrenâs Book  is something of a reimagining of the life of childrenâs author Edith Nesbitt. Still others seek to place more or less well-known historical figures at the centre of their stories, humanising and particularising their lives while aiming to stick, more or less, to the facts. Hilary Mantelâs Wolf Hall, for example, or Philipa Gregoryâs The Other Boleyn Girl.</p>

  <p>AS a social commentator (among the many other caps she wears), Leslie Cannold doesnât shy away from controversy â she welcomes it. So itâs no surprise that her first novel, The Book of Rachael, is about the women of Nazareth â in particular, the sister of Jesus.
Spend five minutes with Cannold, best known as an outspoken commentator on womenâs reproductive rights, and it becomes clear that her passion for giving a voice to worthwhile causes extends to those who lived 2000 years ago, a time when she says women ââwere treated like animalsââ.</p>
