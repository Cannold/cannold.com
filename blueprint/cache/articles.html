  <p>Here, there, women crying “rape” are everywhere. I worry about the
sudden onslaught of rape charges. Of course, I support a woman’s right
to raise her grievances publicly and have them addressed in a legitimate
forum, but I worry that others might not. The men being named are
sporting heroes, and it wasn’t all that long ago that author Helen
Garner questioned the legitimacy of young women bringing charges of
sexual assault, both because of serious damage the resulting publicity
had on the man’s reputation, and because she felt it was the job of
young women to take responsibility for the effect their sexuality had on
the opposite sex.</p>

  <p>Has anyone been listening to the lyrics of Eminem lately? The man is
obsessed about the sexual morays of his lady friends. And women just
can’t win with this guy. First he tells them that if they don’t put out,
he’d going to “put them out,” while in the next breath he’s dismissing
them as beneath contempt for sleeping with him on the same day they met.
The rap superstar is also pretty direct about his lack of respect for
women who offer to worship at his alter (if you get my drift) when all
they know about him is that he’s lead singer of a band.</p>

     <p>Over my (far too) many years of studentship and academic

have stagnated on my shelves, growing dusty and churlish from disuse.
Amongst this unedifying lot have never been tomes edited or authored by
Peter Singer. This is not because it is impossible to disagree with
Singer, or to occasionally find his fearless exploration of the most
complex, sensitive and interesting ethical issues of our times
unsatisfying terse and one-dimensional. But rather because with the
exception of de Botton, Singer is without peer when it comes to picking
the right topic and penning erudite and accessible prose steeped in
casual references to philosophical debates on similar issues dating back
thousands of years. In The Moral of the Story, written in partnership
with wife Renata, he does it again, compiling an anthology that
students, academic philosophers and writers interested in ethics (and
what writer isn’t) will pull off the shelf to thumb through again and
again.</p>

  <p>We should not further restrict women’s access to late abortions, writes
Leslie Cannold. The charging of Dr Suman Sood for manslaughter and
procuring an unlawful abortion in NSW is the first such prosecution in
that state since 1971, though it was only seven years ago that two West
Australian doctors were charged as criminals for providing terminations.
Indeed, Australia has a long history of prosecuting women and doctors
over abortions and, because of the consistent refusal of politicians to
legislate progressively on the issue, common law rulings have had a
profound impact on the development of abortion law.</p>

     <p> It’s a big year for books on prostitution, with Call Me Elizabeth
and Callgirl only some of the volumes weighing down gender studies
shelves across the nation. At the start of Callgirl Angell gives us an
inkling as to the cause of the current obsession when she writes that
“people look at me and get a little scared. I could be &ndash; I am &ndash; one of
them. I am their sister, their neighbour, their girlfriend. I’m nobody’s
idea of what a whore looks like. Maybe that’s why I’m scary. They want
callgirls to be different, identifiable. That keeps them safe.”
Thirty-five years after second-wave feminism and in the midst of rising
divorce rates, declining fertility and increasing numbers of women
willing and able &ndash; should a suitable male fail to appear &ndash; to go
motherhood alone, many of us are confused not just about what women
want, but who women really are. Exposes of the secret worlds of women
who appear average or even respectable on the outside tantalises us with
the prospect of finding out.</p>

  <p>As I write, the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial
Responsibility for Approval of RU86) Bill 2005 may be sliding towards
defeat in the House of Representatives. Designed to undercut 1996
amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act that have effectively banned
RU486 and other abortifacient drugs from Australia, the Bill &ndash; having
passed through the Senate last Thursday &ndash; is now the subject of an
amendment that, if successful, will see the ban remain firmly in place.</p>

     <p><em>Pregnancies Don’t Need Support, Women Do</em></p>

<p>Anyone who followed the debate on RU486, and understood the
complex politics surrounding it, knew it was coming: a quid pro quo for
the Health Minister to soften the blow of losing his powers to deny
Australian women access to RU486. It came last Thursday: a $51 million
dollar package for two <a href="">pregnancy support measures</a> a new counselling
hotline and Medicare rebate. Then came the story of a push in Victoria
to remove abortion from the Crimes Act.</p>

     <p>Late last year, the Lockhart Legislative Review Committee &ndash; the
Federal Government’s own handpicked experts &ndash; handed down its
recommendations on the fate of stem cell research in this country. Among
other things, the Committee recommended lifting Australia’s ban on
so-called “therapeutic cloning”. Having first shelved the report on the
basis of a cabinet vote, a backbench revolt saw the Prime Minister agree
to a broader discussion at the first party room meeting after winter
break. That meeting &ndash; otherwise known as Stem Cell D-Day &ndash; is today.</p>

  <p>It turned out to be a storm in a teacup. In response to calls for a
recount from a Victorian ALP confident the Democratic Labor Party’s
number two man had cheated its own candidate of victory, the Victorian
Electoral Commission (VEC) ran the figures again. On Thursday, the
elevation of a third Green’s candidate to the Upper House was announced.</p>

     <p>Once upon a time, there were two men.</p>

<p>The first, Gary, had a child in a shaky marriage. The couple
separated, but then reconciled. When Patti discovered she was pregnant,
both knew the child could be that of the lover she took during their
time apart. Patti agreed to put Gary’s name on the birth certificate,
and Gary pledged to love and raise the child &ndash; Gary Jr &ndash; as his own. But
when the marriage ended, Patti asked the court to deny Gary further
access to the boy on the grounds that he was not the child’s biological
father. Gary fought back, seeking to maintain contact and both rights
and obligations to the child. Ultimately, however, the court held that
as “third parties” neither he &ndash; nor his parents &ndash; had any entitlement to
a relationship with the small child.</p>

  <p>For millennia, religious authorities have defined death as the stilling
of the heart and the absence of breath. But all that changed in the
1960s when organ transplants became medically feasible. In the wake of a
Japanese surgeon being charged for a double murder for a failed attempt
to transplant a heart, the medical profession put its foot down. It
wasn’t long before dead patients were redefined from those without
beating hearts to those who might-or might not-have cardio-respiratory
function, but whose brain stems had definitely gone to God.</p>

tears are evidence of compassion. My opposition to the death penalty is

  <p>There were a lot of contenders for this week’s column. The inevitable
arrival of paid maternity leave on the list of scuttled government
initiatives because of the global economic crisis was one. Minister
Stephen Conroy’s decision to capitulate to the demands of the religious
right and censor everyone’s internet access was another. And there’s a
piece inside me just screaming to get out about what former government
leaders must really think about the quality of reporting on the ABC
given their decision to participate in The Howard Years, the first
episode of which screened on ABC TV this week.</p>

hefty fines or six months in gaol, while the women involved will be

excuse herself from the Governor-General’s role in the event of a hung

five.</p>

  <p>AS a social commentator (among the many other caps she wears), Leslie Cannold doesn’t shy away from controversy – she welcomes it. So it’s no surprise that her first novel, The Book of Rachael, is about the women of Nazareth – in particular, the sister of Jesus.
Spend five minutes with Cannold, best known as an outspoken commentator on women’s reproductive rights, and it becomes clear that her passion for giving a voice to worthwhile causes extends to those who lived 2000 years ago, a time when she says women ‘‘were treated like animals’’.</p>

  <p>Historical fiction is a curious genre. In some sense, the pleasures of reading historical fiction are similar to those we gain from reading fiction set in exotic landscapes. The thrill of seeing men and women living lives in such different circumstances to our own. At times, historical fiction can become a kind of decorative art: more concerned with the mise en scene of bodices and buckram than the exploration of characters and lives, either fictional or non-fictional. Not all historical fiction is alike: some works use history as a backdrop, inventing characters and stories, like the hugely successful historical works of Sarah Waters (Fingersmith, Tipping the Velvet). Others take historical figures as a leaping off point, imagining into the gaps in the record, such as Geraldine Brooks (Year of Wonders, Caleb’s Crossing), or A S Byatt, whose The Children’s Book  is something of a reimagining of the life of children’s author Edith Nesbitt. Still others seek to place more or less well-known historical figures at the centre of their stories, humanising and particularising their lives while aiming to stick, more or less, to the facts. Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall, for example, or Philipa Gregory’s The Other Boleyn Girl.</p>

Others see their preoccupation with legal skirmishes over the right to occupy public space as a distraction from articulating the movement&rsquo;s aims to a sceptical public.</p>

  <p>Last week, Women&rsquo;s Agenda published an article titled &lsquo;Why this man says Sheryl Sandberg&rsquo;s vision for diversity isn&rsquo;t achievable&rsquo;. The author, Chris Golis, is a London Business School graduate who spent 30 years as a company director. In what might have been a ham-fisted attempt to promote his &ldquo;third career as professional speaker and workshop leader on practical emotional intelligence,&rdquo; Golis took aim at what he described as the &ldquo;genetic&rdquo; unsuitability of women for leadership.
In reply to Sandberg&rsquo;s question about why women are still not running &ldquo;half [the world&rsquo;s] countries and companies&rdquo;, Golis proffered what he acknowledged was his opinion on how one &ldquo;become[s] a leader in a large organisation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>If Jesus had a sister, what might have her story been? Australian Cannold (The Abortion Myth) turns her attention to an obscure corner of history: the role of women in patriarchal Roman society and Jewish culture during the early years of Christianity. Foreshadowing Jesus&rsquo;s anti-establishment views, Cannold imagines that he has a sister, Rachael, a tomboy who tries to defy social restrictions on women. Readers accompany her through her successes and failures navigating the patriarchal world that seeks to define her as a wife and mother. Cannold develops Rachael as a well-rounded, independent, and morally complex character who is not solely defined by her relationships with men. Even though the second half of the story revolves around her brother Jesus (as Joshua) and her husband Judah (as Judas), Rachael remains the focal point of the familiar story as it plays out. Rachael&rsquo;s tragedy is not merely the fact that her brother was martyred and that her husband the Messiah&rsquo;s traitor, but also that she was not allowed to be what she wanted to be. Cannold offers a thought-provoking, heartfelt, and tragic but redemptive tale about the difficulties of discovering and defining one&rsquo;s identity in a world that seeks unendingly to take that decision away. (Dec.)</p>
