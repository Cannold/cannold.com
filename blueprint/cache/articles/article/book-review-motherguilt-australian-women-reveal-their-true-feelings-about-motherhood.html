  <h2>Book Review - Motherguilt: Australian women reveal their true feelings about motherhood</h2>

   <p>Ita Buttrose &amp; Dr Penny Adams. Penguin/Viking, $32.95</p>

<p>Motherguilt bills itself as a book in which Australian women
“revel their true feelings about motherhood” and one that assists women
to “deprogram themselves” from the powerful and unique “epidemic of
guilt” experienced by today’s mothers.</p>

<p>The strength of the book is the myriad of women’s voices found on each
page. Both celebrity and “ordinary” mothers confess their parental sins
and doubts, and express their views on a wide range of maternal
experiences (mothering the “not-so-perfect” child, the experience of
breastfeeding, maternal competitiveness in the playgroup).</p>

<p>It’s not easy for women to admit they’ve found mothering unbearably
boring, or that they’ve sometimes put their child’s need second to their
own, when such admissions can lead them to be labelled a “bad” mother.
Yet, 69-year old Jean risks this by sharing her disappointment with her
early mothering experience. “I can remember thinking,”, she recounts,
“‘If this is my life, my God, I’d rather be dead’.” Journalist Adele
Horin take us into her confidence with her tale of sending a sick child
to school so she could get to work, while presenter Joanna Griggs
confesses that she has the “time of her life” when away from her
children covering sport for Channel 7. As the authors rightly note,
women’s sharing of their maternal battle stories “has a curative power
all of its own”.</p>

<p>Sadly, the rest of Motherguilt seems dedicated to wounding, rather than
healing. Instead of alleviating women’s guilt feelings about motherhood,
it appears dedicated to affirming their current levels of moral angst,
or even making them worse. For example, the authors assert without a
shred of research evidence that contemporary mothers use abortion as
contraception, see babies as “fashion accessories” and, in failing to be
relaxed and happy mothers, deny their children the carefree childhood
that is their “inalienable right”. Stay-at-home mothers are castigated
for giving up their professional careers and allowing their kids’ school
lives to take on exaggerated importance, as well as providing a poor
role model to their children by helping them cheat on homework
assignments.</p>

<p>But it is working mothers who really need to duck for cover. According
to the authors, their reliance on prepared and fast foods coupled with
their failure to serve up a family meal every night is the cause of
increased rates of childhood obesity; their busy lives and
competitiveness causes stressed, depressed and ADHD kids who miss out on
time to “gaze at the clouds drifting by, watch a butterfly flit around
the garden or throw pebbles in a pond”; while their lack of time to
listen to their teenagers increases adolescent drinking and anorexia.</p>

<p>Similarly alarming “facts” and accusations appear throughout the book,
though they must always be taken on faith as no sources &ndash; either in the
text or in notes &ndash; are provided.</p>

<p>But most disturbing are the authors’ conclusions about the causative
role contemporary mothers are playing in the downfall of the nation’s
children. This is Ita:</p>

<blockquote><p>The growth in children’s illnesses and mood disturbances has occurred
in line with mothers’ greater participation in the workforce. Could
this be coincidental? Can any intelligent woman seriously believe such
a thing without doubt of any kind? Surely it is impossible to overlook
something many mothers would prefer to close their eyes to &ndash; that
perhaps children have become the `victims’ of the female ambition to
have it all.</p></blockquote>

<p>She continues:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many women got it wrong, and I include myself in this indictment. It
is all too obvious that children need more of their mother’s time than
we have been able to give them….Perhaps, most of all they need their
mums to be in less of a hurry….If, as mothers, we need to feel guilty
about anything it is children. We have short-changed them. They have
been sending out signals for years now but we have preferred to be
blind to what has been going on.</p></blockquote>

<p>This quote tidily encapsulates all that is wrong with Motherguilt. The
unsupported alarmist claims; the uncritical acceptance of complex and
heavily-freighted ideas like “having it all” without any interrogation
of the sexist 1950s norms they encode; the imputation that children need
only their mothers and the corresponding silence about father-absence
and its impact on women’s work and guilt-loads as well as children; the
firm yet tautological claim that the one thing mothers should feel
guilty about is children (what else would women feel motherguilt about?)</p>

<p>A recent letter to the Australian Book Review noted that “even a badly
written book has cost the author blood and sweat”. It was not a plea for
merciful reviewing, but could be read as one, and as a non-fiction
writer myself, I am sensitive to the harm done by a bad review.</p>

<p>But whatever compassion I feel for the authors, I feel much more for
their potential female readership. Indeed, I feel obligated to do what I
can to warn women of the disconnect between what this book promises and
what it delivers.</p>

<p>Because I just can’t bear the thought of a young mother &ndash; anxious,
insecure, perhaps even teetering on the edge of depression &ndash; wandering
into her local bookshop in search of something that might help her to
understand her situation better and lift her spirits, leaving instead
with a load of Motherguilt.</p>
