  <h2>Should Parents Allow Mixed Sex Sleepovers?</h2>

   <p>Since reaching adolescence my boys have been keen to have girls who are “just friends” sleep at our house, and I have been just as keen to avoid it.</p>

<p>Boys sleeping over have never been a problem. Over the years I have
happily purchased bunk and trundle beds, as well as air mattresses, to
facilitate it. But female friends? Sorry, I kept telling my sons. I’m
just not comfortable.</p>

<p>But no-because-I-say-so really doesn’t cut it as a reason for adolescent
boys and fair enough, too. I’ve always prided myself as a person who has
reasons for what I do. As a parent, when I don’t have a good reason for
saying no, I try to say yes.</p>

<p>Except when it came to girls sleeping over. Was I worried the girl’s
family was in the dark? Maybe, so when my son last asked I agreed to
speak to the parent. The exchange was comforting &ndash; the mother certainly
knew where her daughter would be and was realistic about my minimal
capacity for control &ndash; but my unease persisted.</p>

<p>“You’re being unreasonable about this,” my partner said. “Do you really
want to imply that boys can’t have friends who are girls?”</p>

<p>He shrugged. “And if they’re going to have sex, isn’t it better it
happens here instead of a park &ndash; away from prying eyes and close to
condoms?”</p>

<p>All good points but something still felt wrong, however inept I was at
articulating what it was.</p>

<p>“You’re acting like you’re worried your boy will take advantage,” a
friend finally said.</p>

<p>“No!” I said firmly. “That’s not it at all. My boys would NEVER touch a
girl in a way they thought she did not want.”</p>

<p>But here, perhaps, was a clue to my discomfort. What if the girl didn’t
know what she wanted?</p>

<p>There is a relatively straightforward relationship for boys between what
they want, what they say they want and what they pursue &ndash; with sex, and
everything else. Arguably, female socialisation is all about severing
such links so women can make the needs and wants of others &ndash; friends,
parents, needy children, ageing parents &ndash; their own.</p>

<p>We certainly know that adolescence is when many girls lose their
vitality, resilience and sense of self. Perhaps consequently, it is also
a time they are at increased risk of depression and eating disorders.</p>

<p>According to researchers Carol Gilligan and Lyn Mikel Brown, girls
struggle throughout their teens to take their own experiences, feelings
and thoughts seriously. Some can arrive at a place where it seems to
them that they cannot say or feel what they feel and know. Battling to
stay in a “genuine relationship” with themselves, they replace their
authentic voice with a stream of “I don’t knows”.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I had a way of explaining my angst. Sexual relationships are
complicated at the best of times. Introduce youth and the stuttering of
a partner who may be in the midst of a developmental struggle to
identify and express what she wants and misunderstandings seem
inevitable. I wanted nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>I also didn’t want to add to the confusing mix of social messages girls
get. What if saying yes to a sleepover felt subtly coercive to the girl,
as though I thought adolescent sex was normal or even expected. Instead,
I wanted to be like Switzerland when it came to adolescent sexual
activity, wanting only for each young person what she or he
authentically wanted for themselves.</p>

<p>Good thinking or over-thinking? I’d welcome your view.</p>
