   <p>CATHOLIC hospitals fear patients will use new anti-discrimination laws to demand abortions, vasectomies and IVF treatments now banned for religious reasons.</p>

<p>A public backlash against the Federal Government&rsquo;s draft Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination bill forced Attorney-General Nicola Roxon into a u-turn yesterday.</p>

<p>Ms Roxon admitted her department was rewording a contentious clause that redefines discrimination as conduct that &ldquo;insults or offends'&lsquo;.</p>

<p>But state governments and religious groups remain concerned that other drafting flaws in the 198-page legislation will trigger vexatious discrimination claims.</p>

<p>Catholic Health, representing 75 hospitals, says the bill is &ldquo;confusing'&lsquo; for patients.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does give rise to the potential for vexatious claims to be made,&lsquo;&rsquo; Catholic Health chief executive Martin Laverty told News Ltd. "But they&rsquo;d have no legal standing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t provide the full range of reproductive health services and we&rsquo;re transparent about that. To not provide the service is not to discriminate.&lsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Catholic Health code of ethics bans its hospitals from providing abortions, sterilisation or contraceptive procedures, or treatment for IVF or surrogate pregnancies.</p>

<p>Catholic Health has flagged its concerns in a submission to the Senate committee assessing the draft bill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To not provide a service on grounds of Catholic teaching is not to discriminate, rather it is a simple limiting of services that Catholic organisations choose to offer as fulfillment of their religious belief,&lsquo;&rsquo; it states.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The current drafting of the bill does not allow for this distinction.&lsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mr Laverty said yesterday the legislation would require hospitals to prove they had not discriminated against a patient who lodged a complaint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any action would be futile but the reverse onus of proof gives rise to the potential for us to have to defend it,&lsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We (now) face the scenario where there needs to be new documentation for every hospital admission, and that there will be a likelihood of increased litigation.&lsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>A spokeswoman for Ms Roxon yesterday said Catholic Health had &ldquo;misunderstood the legislation'&lsquo;.</p>

<p>Complainants would first need to prove a prima facie case, before defendants were required to prove their innocence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our draft law will not change their ability to decline to perform procedures that conflict with the Catholic faith,&lsquo;&rsquo; the spokeswoman said.</p>

<p>Reproductive Choice Australia yesterday demanded that Catholic hospitals be forced to offer all health services,  or relinquish taxpayer funding.</p>

<p>RCA president Leslie Cannold said many pregnant women using Catholic maternity services did not realise they would be denied a &ldquo;life-saving abortion'&lsquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if a patient decides she wants to have her tubes tied, she won&rsquo;t be able to,&lsquo;&rsquo; Dr Cannold, a Monash University academic, told News Ltd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the Catholic health system feels it is entitled to decide what services to provide, it shouldn&rsquo;t be running public hospitals.&lsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Ms Roxon yesterday said she had instructed her department at the start of January to develop &ldquo;alternative drafting'&lsquo; for sections of the bill "that have raised freedom of speech concerns&rsquo;&lsquo;.</p>

<p>One option was to remove the reference to &ldquo;insult and offend'&lsquo;, she said.</p>

<p>However, when News Ltd asked Ms Roxon&rsquo;s office on January 20 whether the words would be removed from the legislation, a spokeswoman for the then-acting Attorney-General, Jason Clare, replied that the government was waiting for the Senate inquiry to report its findings.</p>
