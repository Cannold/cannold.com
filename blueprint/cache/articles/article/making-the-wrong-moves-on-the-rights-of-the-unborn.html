   <p>by Tory Shepherd</p>

<p>A man, enraged, kicks his pregnant partner in the stomach until she miscarries. A baby he didn’t want. Later, she dies. It’s a horrific image, a terrible crime.  But should it be a double homicide?</p>

<p>The debate about the rights of the unborn is set to rev up – again – as South Australian Family First MP Robert Brokenshire prepares a Bill that declares it a crime to “destroy the life of” or do “grievous bodily harm to” a foetus.</p>

<p>Laws around foetuses vary from state to state. Queensland has recently expanded its laws, while a NSW review dismissed the need to. At one stage the Tasmanian Greens looked at whether a mother who smoked or drank to excess could be charged with child abuse.</p>

<p>Of course, you can’t start to talk about the legal status of an unborn child without also talking about abortion. As much as Family First would like to see abortion as a “red herring”, the very philosophical argument about what constitutes a person cannot help but cross over.</p>

<p>If the law says that it’s a crime to hurt a foetus – even if it specifies that it’s only in the context of an illegal assault – there’s then an obvious clash with the very idea of legal abortion.</p>

<p>And Dr Leslie Cannold – author, commentator, academic – is right to point out that when the push to change the laws around foetuses come from Family First, you have to wonder what the bigger picture is. She said:</p>

<p>It’s no accident that every time (these laws) get proposed it’s by organisations like Family First who are known to be anti-choice… they’ve gone at it directly before by attacking women’s right to choose, and now they’re going by the back door.</p>

<p>Mr Brokenshire does not want this to turn into an abortion debate, and says we should be “mature enough” to keep it separate. Maybe he means “trusting enough”.</p>

<p>On the surface of it, Mr Brokenshire makes a lot of sense. The community is and should be outraged if the additional horror of a dead foetus is seemingly ignored in an assault. Assaults occur on a scale, obviously. They’re all bad. Some are worse than others. A pregnancy being deliberately ended when the woman wanted that baby would add to the seriousness of the assault.</p>

<p>The law should always recognise that. The consequences of the assault on the victim, the victim’s family should be taken into account.</p>

<p>But there must be a way to do that without wading in to the murky waters. There must be a better way to do it, that perhaps in a broader sense helps victims of assault more generally by reflecting their pain, their experience, and the community’s expectations.</p>

<p>Politicians should have a grander aim than just a rapid-fire response to what is, really, a rare occurrence. They should be striving, constantly, to make sure that the legislation allows the judiciary to do what they should always be doing – ensuring justice is done.</p>
