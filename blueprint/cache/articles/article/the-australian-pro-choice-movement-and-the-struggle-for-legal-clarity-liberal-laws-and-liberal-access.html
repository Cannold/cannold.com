   <h2>The Extended Australian Report of the “The Johannesburg Initiative”</h2>

<h3>Full Report Australia, the Johannesburg Initiative, Unpublished November 2000</h3>

<p>A condensed version of this report was published in (2001) &ldquo;The
Australian Pro-Choice Movement and the Struggle for Legal Clarity,
Liberal Laws and Liberal Access: Two case studies in B. Klugman and D.
Budlender (eds) Advocating for Abortion Access: Eleven country studies,
The Johannesburg Initiative, School of Public Health, Women’s Health
Project, University of Witwaterstrand. The Johannesburg Initiative</p>

<p>The Johannesburg Initiative is funded by the Government of the
Netherlands and the Swedish Institute Development Cooperation Agency
(Sida). The Australian Reproductive Health Alliance (ARHA) and Children
by Choice (C by C) funded the research for the Australian Case Study, a
summary of which is published in Advocating for Abortion Access: Eleven
Country Studies (Women’s Health Project, School of Public Health,
University of Witerwatersrand, 2001). The Centre for Applied Philosophy
and Public Ethics has funded the publication of the extended Australian
Report.</p>

<p>The Johannesburg Initiative is the name given by participants to a
three-phase international project of which the full title is “Capacity
building for advocacy on expanding abortion policy and access: sharing
of national experiences between countries from diverse regions.”
Eighteen countries participated in the Capacity building project, which
was initiated by South African activists after their achievement of
liberal law reform in 1997. The aim was to compare and contrast the
political and social contexts of countries with diverse abortion laws
and access in order to draw generalisable conclusions about the social
contexts and advocacy strategies that inhibit or facilitate change.</p>

<p>Phase one took place from December 1999 to June 2001, concluding with
the publication of Advocating for Abortion Access in which case studies
of abortion advocacy in eleven countries &ndash; including Australia &ndash; were
described and a comparative analysis provided to assist activists to
“learn from one anothers’ experiences”. [Klugman, 2001 #298]</p>

<h3>The Purpose and Design of this Report</h3>

<p>However, unavoidable limits on the length of the Australian contribution
to Advocating for Abortion Access meant that important data and analysis
was unable to be included. It was felt that this work may be of use to
pro-choice advocates keen to understand and apply the 3 lessons learned
by pro-choice advocates involved in the change processes in WA and the
ACT in 1998.</p>

<p>We thus sought to produce a full report, tiered and organised by
campaign stages, to enable activists to choose the level of detail they
wished to read and to quickly access sections relevant to their current
needs and interests. However, the report has also been designed to
facilitate comparisons between WA and the ACT and thus encourage the
building of the “mid- level” [Albury, 1989 #22] theory necessary to
advance local understanding of what works and what doesn’t to achieve
reform abortion law reform and enhanced access to services.</p>

<p>The author, ARHA and C by C are extremely grateful to the Centre for
Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics (CAPPE) for offering its assistance
in publishing the full report. We stress, however, that responsibility
for its contents fall to us alone.</p>

<h3>Objectives of the Australian Report</h3>

<ul>
<li>To examine abortion policy, law and women’s access to abortion
services prior to, during and (insofar as possible) after
legislative change that took place in 1998 –1999 in two Australian
States: Western Australian (WA) and the Australian Capital Territory
(ACT);</li>
<li>To identify or to provide the basis for identifying the key factors
facilitating and constraining achievement and/or maintenance of
liberal and/or clarified abortion law and/or policies;</li>
<li>To identify or to provide the basis for identifying the key factors
facilitating and constraining achievement and/or maintenance of
liberal access to abortion services in Australia;</li>
<li>To make suggestions based on this analysis, where possible, for
future pro-choice advocacy strategies</li>
</ul>
