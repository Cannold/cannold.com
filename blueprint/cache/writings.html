  <p>If Jesus had a sister, what might have her story been? Australian Cannold (The Abortion Myth) turns her attention to an obscure corner of history: the role of women in patriarchal Roman society and Jewish culture during the early years of Christianity. Foreshadowing Jesus&rsquo;s anti-establishment views, Cannold imagines that he has a sister, Rachael, a tomboy who tries to defy social restrictions on women. Readers accompany her through her successes and failures navigating the patriarchal world that seeks to define her as a wife and mother. Cannold develops Rachael as a well-rounded, independent, and morally complex character who is not solely defined by her relationships with men. Even though the second half of the story revolves around her brother Jesus (as Joshua) and her husband Judah (as Judas), Rachael remains the focal point of the familiar story as it plays out. Rachael&rsquo;s tragedy is not merely the fact that her brother was martyred and that her husband the Messiah&rsquo;s traitor, but also that she was not allowed to be what she wanted to be. Cannold offers a thought-provoking, heartfelt, and tragic but redemptive tale about the difficulties of discovering and defining one&rsquo;s identity in a world that seeks unendingly to take that decision away. (Dec.)</p>

  <p>Last week, Women&rsquo;s Agenda published an article titled &lsquo;Why this man says Sheryl Sandberg&rsquo;s vision for diversity isn&rsquo;t achievable&rsquo;. The author, Chris Golis, is a London Business School graduate who spent 30 years as a company director. In what might have been a ham-fisted attempt to promote his &ldquo;third career as professional speaker and workshop leader on practical emotional intelligence,&rdquo; Golis took aim at what he described as the &ldquo;genetic&rdquo; unsuitability of women for leadership.
In reply to Sandberg&rsquo;s question about why women are still not running &ldquo;half [the world&rsquo;s] countries and companies&rdquo;, Golis proffered what he acknowledged was his opinion on how one &ldquo;become[s] a leader in a large organisation.&rdquo;</p>

The woman in the car hadnât meant any harm. She had only just parked and

truly legal, and if she still had time to avoid being late.</p>

  <p>This summer, Norway has quietly joined Sweden in outlawing paid sex. Men
who have sex with prostitutes working in brothels or on the street face
hefty fines or six months in gaol, while the women involved will be
offered assistance to exit the industry. âWe want to send a clear
message to men that buying sex is unacceptable,â said the Norwegian
Justice Minister, echoing the sentiments of Swedish detective Kajsa
Wahlberg. âWe donât have a problem with prostitutes. We have a problem

  <p>For millennia, religious authorities have defined death as the stilling
of the heart and the absence of breath. But all that changed in the
1960s when organ transplants became medically feasible. In the wake of a
Japanese surgeon being charged for a double murder for a failed attempt
to transplant a heart, the medical profession put its foot down. It
wasnât long before dead patients were redefined from those without
beating hearts to those who might-or might not-have cardio-respiratory
function, but whose brain stems had definitely gone to God.</p>

whether our Federal MPs think itâs OK to spend our taxes on the cost of
an abortion necessary to save a womanâs life, or to evacuate her uterus
of a fetus that is already dead, or affected by âgrossâ abnormalities.
In 2006, Parliamentarians were allowed to exercise their moral judgment
on the acceptability of therapeutic cloning techniques to explore cures
for diseases like Parkinsonâ disease and help for those confined for
life to wheelchairs. RU486, and before this, the Northern Territoryâs
euthanasia bill.</p>

     <p>Once upon a time, there were two men.</p>

<p>The first, Gary, had a child in a shaky marriage. The couple
separated, but then reconciled. When Patti discovered she was pregnant,
both knew the child could be that of the lover she took during their
time apart. Patti agreed to put Garyâs name on the birth certificate,
and Gary pledged to love and raise the child &ndash; Gary Jr &ndash; as his own. But
when the marriage ended, Patti asked the court to deny Gary further
access to the boy on the grounds that he was not the childâs biological
father. Gary fought back, seeking to maintain contact and both rights
and obligations to the child. Ultimately, however, the court held that
as âthird partiesâ neither he &ndash; nor his parents &ndash; had any entitlement to
a relationship with the small child.</p>

<p>Anyone who followed the debate on RU486, and understood the
complex politics surrounding it, knew it was coming: a quid pro quo for
the Health Minister to soften the blow of losing his powers to deny
Australian women access to RU486. It came last Thursday: a $51 million
dollar package for two <a href="">pregnancy support measures</a> a new counselling
hotline and Medicare rebate. Then came the story of a push in Victoria
to remove abortion from the Crimes Act.</p>

  <p>Itâs beginning to look a lot like Christmas, but those whoâd
hoped the giving spirit might have affected the Prime Minister when it
came to the abortion drug RU 486 have found their stockings sadly empty.
On Tuesday, the Prime Minister emerged from a Liberal party room meeting
to inform the media that the vote expected by the end of next week was
cancelled. The Coalitionâs pre-Christmas legislative agenda was crowded
with issues far more important than womenâs health. Those hoping to find
out whether Australian patients will finally get access to a
pharmaceutical that doesnât just terminate very early pregnancies, but
is used in the treatment of breast cancer and endometriosis, would just
have to wait.</p>

feminist assumptions &ndash; about the equality of menâs and womenâs talents,
womenâs need for economic independence and human flourishing &ndash; âas
naturally as airâ. But when their children are born, such women find

     <p> Itâs a big year for books on prostitution, with Call Me Elizabeth
and Callgirl only some of the volumes weighing down gender studies
shelves across the nation. At the start of Callgirl Angell gives us an
inkling as to the cause of the current obsession when she writes that
âpeople look at me and get a little scared. I could be &ndash; I am &ndash; one of
them. I am their sister, their neighbour, their girlfriend. Iâm nobodyâs
idea of what a whore looks like. Maybe thatâs why Iâm scary. They want
callgirls to be different, identifiable. That keeps them safe.â
Thirty-five years after second-wave feminism and in the midst of rising
divorce rates, declining fertility and increasing numbers of women
willing and able &ndash; should a suitable male fail to appear &ndash; to go
motherhood alone, many of us are confused not just about what women
want, but who women really are. Exposes of the secret worlds of women
who appear average or even respectable on the outside tantalises us with
the prospect of finding out.</p>

  <p>We should not further restrict womenâs access to late abortions, writes
Leslie Cannold. The charging of Dr Suman Sood for manslaughter and
procuring an unlawful abortion in NSW is the first such prosecution in
that state since 1971, though it was only seven years ago that two West
Australian doctors were charged as criminals for providing terminations.
Indeed, Australia has a long history of prosecuting women and doctors
over abortions and, because of the consistent refusal of politicians to
legislate progressively on the issue, common law rulings have had a
profound impact on the development of abortion law.</p>

     <p>Over my (far too) many years of studentship and academic
employment, I have bought (far too) many books, (far too) many of which
have stagnated on my shelves, growing dusty and churlish from disuse.
Amongst this unedifying lot have never been tomes edited or authored by
Peter Singer. This is not because it is impossible to disagree with
Singer, or to occasionally find his fearless exploration of the most
complex, sensitive and interesting ethical issues of our times
unsatisfying terse and one-dimensional. But rather because with the
exception of de Botton, Singer is without peer when it comes to picking
the right topic and penning erudite and accessible prose steeped in
casual references to philosophical debates on similar issues dating back
thousands of years. In The Moral of the Story, written in partnership
with wife Renata, he does it again, compiling an anthology that
students, academic philosophers and writers interested in ethics (and
what writer isnât) will pull off the shelf to thumb through again and
again.</p>

  <p>For me, school holidays are like housework: highly demanding,
ever-present and seemingly never done. My problem, in a nutshell, is
while Iâd be happy to have the kids at home, the demands of my work mean
this only sporadically and occasionally possible. Most of the time, I
need care. This means that every time those dreaded two weeks draw near,
my âto-doâ list looks like this.</p>

  <p>Has anyone been listening to the lyrics of Eminem lately? The man is
obsessed about the sexual morays of his lady friends. And women just
canât win with this guy. First he tells them that if they donât put out,
heâd going to âput them out,â while in the next breath heâs dismissing
them as beneath contempt for sleeping with him on the same day they met.
The rap superstar is also pretty direct about his lack of respect for
women who offer to worship at his alter (if you get my drift) when all
they know about him is that heâs lead singer of a band.</p>

sudden onslaught of rape charges. Of course, I support a womanâs right
to raise her grievances publicly and have them addressed in a legitimate
forum, but I worry that others might not. The men being named are
sporting heroes, and it wasnât all that long ago that author Helen
Garner questioned the legitimacy of young women bringing charges of
sexual assault, both because of serious damage the resulting publicity
had on the manâs reputation, and because she felt it was the job of
young women to take responsibility for the effect their sexuality had on
the opposite sex.</p>

  <p>I LOVE The Vicar of Dibley and Dawn Frenchâs vicar, Geraldine Granger.
But after most episodes, my stomach hurts &ndash; figuratively, that is. Which
may be better than the literal way the vicarâs must feel. Because at
some point in each episode of the show, Geraldine does some serious
eating: a freezerâs worth of icecream, a cupboard full of chocolate
bars, an entire Yule Log. That sort of thing.</p>
