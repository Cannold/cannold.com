  updated_on: 2011-03-23 15:28:19
  content_markup: "<p>Why both women and men resent this modern parable.</p>\n\n\
    <p>WE MAY think we know the real story behind this week\xE2\x80\x99s report that\n\
    67-year-old billionaire media magnate Rupert Murdoch intends to marry\n\
    his 31-year-old girlfriend Wendy Deng after he divorces Anna Murdoch.\n\
    But what do we know, and what do we think we know, about the\n\
    relationship between Murdoch and Deng? And is it truth or perception\n\
    that matters in public interpretation and comment about the impending\n\
    marriage?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Let\xE2\x80\x99s get one thing clear. No one, except perhaps those in Murdoch\xE2\x80\x99s and\n\
    Deng\xE2\x80\x99s inner circle, actually knows much about the relationship. Yet\n\
    many of us think we know that it forms another chapter in a sorry\n\
    late\xE2\x80\x9320th-century cultural tale, in which ageing rich men abandon their\n\
    similarly ageing wives for younger, attractive women. (Remember Paul\n\
    Hogan and Donald Trump.) The women who form such relationships are\n\
    similarly seen to be engaged in an unholy system of barter in which they\n\
    trade their youth and beauty for a share of their new husband\xE2\x80\x99s power\n\
    and money (a la Anna Nicole Smith and Rose Hancock).</p>\n\n\
    <p>Rather than speculate on whether the Murdoch-Deng relationship conforms\n\
    to this stereotype, I would like to examine the assumptions and\n\
    anxieties that underlie and fuel it.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Billionaire and His Younger New Wife parable generates anxiety for\n\
    both men and women. For many women, the dominant concern is that men\n\
    value them only for their transient attributes of youth and beauty. An\n\
    additional female apprehension, explicitly read into Paul Hogan\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    marital break-up, is that while it is the \xE2\x80\x9Cold\xE2\x80\x9D wife who contributes to\n\
    their husband\xE2\x80\x99s rise to fame and fortune, it is the new wife who reaps\n\
    the rewards. Many men feel similarly devalued by the Billionaire tale,\n\
    believing it wrong for a woman to marry a man for his money.</p>\n\n\
    <p>For both men and women, what is being devalued in the Billionaire tale\n\
    is love. Middle-class views of marriage hold that it ought to be a\n\
    lifelong commitment. We are meant to love the other for who they are,\n\
    not for what they have. Our obligations in marriage are to fulfil our\n\
    partner\xE2\x80\x99s desire for love, not for more prosaic human needs and emotions\n\
    such as money and power.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But how realistic is this view of marriage? Several recent studies\n\
    (including Birrell and Rapson, on this page on 22 October) suggest that\n\
    declines in marriage rates owe much to a drop-off of coupling among the\n\

    \r\n\
    WE MAY think we know the real story behind this week\xE2\x80\x99s report that\r\n\
    67-year-old billionaire media magnate Rupert Murdoch intends to marry\r\n\
    his 31-year-old girlfriend Wendy Deng after he divorces Anna Murdoch.\r\n\
    But what do we know, and what do we think we know, about the\r\n\
    relationship between Murdoch and Deng? And is it truth or perception\r\n\
    that matters in public interpretation and comment about the impending\r\n\
    marriage?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Let\xE2\x80\x99s get one thing clear. No one, except perhaps those in Murdoch\xE2\x80\x99s and\r\n\
    Deng\xE2\x80\x99s inner circle, actually knows much about the relationship. Yet\r\n\
    many of us think we know that it forms another chapter in a sorry\r\n\
    late\xE2\x80\x9320th-century cultural tale, in which ageing rich men abandon their\r\n\
    similarly ageing wives for younger, attractive women. (Remember Paul\r\n\
    Hogan and Donald Trump.) The women who form such relationships are\r\n\
    similarly seen to be engaged in an unholy system of barter in which they\r\n\
    trade their youth and beauty for a share of their new husband\xE2\x80\x99s power\r\n\
    and money (a la Anna Nicole Smith and Rose Hancock).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Rather than speculate on whether the Murdoch-Deng relationship conforms\r\n\
    to this stereotype, I would like to examine the assumptions and\r\n\
    anxieties that underlie and fuel it.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The Billionaire and His Younger New Wife parable generates anxiety for\r\n\
    both men and women. For many women, the dominant concern is that men\r\n\
    value them only for their transient attributes of youth and beauty. An\r\n\
    additional female apprehension, explicitly read into Paul Hogan\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    marital break-up, is that while it is the \xE2\x80\x9Cold\xE2\x80\x9D wife who contributes to\r\n\
    their husband\xE2\x80\x99s rise to fame and fortune, it is the new wife who reaps\r\n\
    the rewards. Many men feel similarly devalued by the Billionaire tale,\r\n\
    believing it wrong for a woman to marry a man for his money.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    For both men and women, what is being devalued in the Billionaire tale\r\n\
    is love. Middle-class views of marriage hold that it ought to be a\r\n\
    lifelong commitment. We are meant to love the other for who they are,\r\n\
    not for what they have. Our obligations in marriage are to fulfil our\r\n\
    partner\xE2\x80\x99s desire for love, not for more prosaic human needs and emotions\r\n\
    such as money and power.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But how realistic is this view of marriage? Several recent studies\r\n\
    (including Birrell and Rapson, on this page on 22 October) suggest that\r\n\
    declines in marriage rates owe much to a drop-off of coupling among the\r\n\
    working classes. In the past, working-class women traded their work in\r\n\
    the home and raising of children in exchange for a share of their\r\n\
    partner\xE2\x80\x99s income. Yet rising unemployment has meant that many\r\n\
    working-class men can no longer keep the bargain.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Many working-class men and women have seen marriage as a way of pooling\r\n\
    scarce resources to achieve shared goals, such as children and economic\r\n\
    survival. This isn\xE2\x80\x99t to say that the partners in these marriages don\xE2\x80\x99t\r\n\

    <p>THE canonisation of Saint Monica has begun. Before our very eyes the\n\
    media is transforming Lewinsky from a dumb-assed slut to an admirable\n\
    young woman. She\xE2\x80\x99s tamed her white-trash haircut and thrown away her\n\
    baseball cap. She\xE2\x80\x99s donned cheekbones and a dignified navy suit. She\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    learnt her lesson. She\xE2\x80\x99s showed him! Why, she\xE2\x80\x99s turned out to be quite a\n\
    remarkable young lady.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I don\xE2\x80\x99t wish to be mean when it comes to Lewinsky. There\xE2\x80\x99s no doubt\n\
    she\xE2\x80\x99s been through a lot. I mean, I would rather die than have the\n\
    idiotic things I said and did in my early 20s &ndash; sexual and otherwise &ndash;\n\
    broadcast to TV audiences worldwide in choice snippets and available\n\
    verbatim to every geek with a computer. And I know she\xE2\x80\x99s in debt, and\n\
    I\xE2\x80\x99m truly glad to see she\xE2\x80\x99s managed to impress the newspapers and\n\
    commentators she so desperately needs to sell the book, to make the\n\
    millions, to pay the lawyers, to clean up the mess Bill and Monica made.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But I don\xE2\x80\x99t like being asked to admire Lewinsky, even though being born\n\
    and raised in America gives me an unpleasant clarity about why the\n\
    American media and public, having spent most of last year eating her for\n\
    breakfast, are this year happy to orchestrate her rehabilitation. It\xE2\x80\x99s a\n\
    penchant for tell-all confessions followed by true-grit struggle and\n\
    redemption, plus a healthy dollop of guilt, that has got Americans\n\
    working their way towards a love of Monica that rivals their love of\n\
    Princess Di. And the parallel is not incidental.</p>\n\n\
    <p>One long afternoon in front of the tube is testimony aplenty to the\n\
    American love for public confession. Whether it be about goats and\n\
    grandmothers, or daughters who sleep with their similarly aged\n\
    step-fathers, there is little Americans won\xE2\x80\x99t divulge for Oprah or an\n\
    Oprah-substitute, a live audience and a camera that broadcasts to the\n\
    global millions at home.</p>\n\n\

  content: "First Diana, now Monica. They became superstars, but that doesn\xE2\x80\x99t make\r\n\
    them admirable.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    THE canonisation of Saint Monica has begun. Before our very eyes the\r\n\
    media is transforming Lewinsky from a dumb-assed slut to an admirable\r\n\
    young woman. She\xE2\x80\x99s tamed her white-trash haircut and thrown away her\r\n\
    baseball cap. She\xE2\x80\x99s donned cheekbones and a dignified navy suit. She\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    learnt her lesson. She\xE2\x80\x99s showed him! Why, she\xE2\x80\x99s turned out to be quite a\r\n\
    remarkable young lady.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I don\xE2\x80\x99t wish to be mean when it comes to Lewinsky. There\xE2\x80\x99s no doubt\r\n\
    she\xE2\x80\x99s been through a lot. I mean, I would rather die than have the\r\n\
    idiotic things I said and did in my early 20s - sexual and otherwise -\r\n\
    broadcast to TV audiences worldwide in choice snippets and available\r\n\
    verbatim to every geek with a computer. And I know she\xE2\x80\x99s in debt, and\r\n\
    I\xE2\x80\x99m truly glad to see she\xE2\x80\x99s managed to impress the newspapers and\r\n\
    commentators she so desperately needs to sell the book, to make the\r\n\
    millions, to pay the lawyers, to clean up the mess Bill and Monica made.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But I don\xE2\x80\x99t like being asked to admire Lewinsky, even though being born\r\n\
    and raised in America gives me an unpleasant clarity about why the\r\n\
    American media and public, having spent most of last year eating her for\r\n\
    breakfast, are this year happy to orchestrate her rehabilitation. It\xE2\x80\x99s a\r\n\
    penchant for tell-all confessions followed by true-grit struggle and\r\n\
    redemption, plus a healthy dollop of guilt, that has got Americans\r\n\
    working their way towards a love of Monica that rivals their love of\r\n\
    Princess Di. And the parallel is not incidental.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    One long afternoon in front of the tube is testimony aplenty to the\r\n\
    American love for public confession. Whether it be about goats and\r\n\
    grandmothers, or daughters who sleep with their similarly aged\r\n\
    step-fathers, there is little Americans won\xE2\x80\x99t divulge for Oprah or an\r\n\
    Oprah-substitute, a live audience and a camera that broadcasts to the\r\n\
    global millions at home.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But simply \xE2\x80\x9Cletting it out\xE2\x80\x9D is no longer the name of the game. After the\r\n\
    successful reactionary and society-wide assault on \xE2\x80\x9Cvictimhood\xE2\x80\x9D and the\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cculture of complaint\xE2\x80\x9D, Oprah now articulates America\xE2\x80\x99s new focus on\r\n\
    moving women past the \xE2\x80\x9Cwhining\xE2\x80\x9D stage. \xE2\x80\x9CLet it out and do something\r\n\
    about it,\xE2\x80\x9D she now coaches. \xE2\x80\x9COr shut up.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    And Monica has done just that. She\xE2\x80\x99s stopped whining, stopped shopping\r\n\
    and stopped looking like she can\xE2\x80\x99t stop eating. And there\xE2\x80\x99s nothing\r\n\

    success remain tragically low: be thin, be rich and be famous.\r\n\

    <p>Weighing in on the Clinton-Lewinsky affair, Shalit concludes that the\n\
    core social problem exposed by Lewinsky\xE2\x80\x99s behavior in the White House is\n\
    young women\xE2\x80\x99s lack of sexual and moral inhibitions. I thought it was\n\
    their seeming belief that the surest route into the Oval Office is still\n\
    on their knees.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t be surprising that Shalit and other twenty-something women,\n\

    look to women themselves as the source of their own misery. As the Gen X\n\
    women in Kathy Bail\xE2\x80\x99s DIY Feminism note, blaming patriarchal society for\n\
    female problems makes a girl guilty of \xE2\x80\x9Cself-pity and the worst kind of\n\

    <p>If Bail is right, many Gen X women see the sourcing of female\n\
    unhappiness in social causes (or the naming of the personal as the\n\

    <p>But allocating agency and control to women\xE2\x80\x99s lives when little exists\n\

    ideas or institutions that have caused it. We remain stuck, blaming and\n\

    <p>And this is only one of the problems with an analysis that places female\n\
    sexual conduct at the heart of all that ails women. The second is the\n\

    on moral virtues like honesty and integrity, women\xE2\x80\x99s justly revolve\n\
    around what they do or don\xE2\x80\x99t do in bed: on whether they are good girls,\n\

    <p>The past 30 years have provided women with greater opportunities to live\n\

    in the absence of cultural and religious reasons, against the procedure.\n\
    While this position has a tolerant ring, a Jewish couple I know\n\
    encountered hostility from numerous medical practitioners who refused to\n\
    circumcise, and actively sought to discourage them going elsewhere.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But subtle \xE2\x80\x9Cbad parent\xE2\x80\x9D accusations from the medical establishment don\xE2\x80\x99t\n\
    worry me. What does are claims that infants subconsciously remember the\n\
    violation of the trust they experienced when their mothers abandoned\n\
    them to the pain of circumcision. I worry my boy may be teased by his\n\
    mates for looking different. That he may resent the inalterable choice\n\
    we have made about his body. A choice, say opponents of circumcision,\n\
    that sacrifices (in the true Bibilical sense of the word) male sexual\n\
    pleasure.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Our plumber, and a policeman we know have circumcised their boys so\n\
    they\xE2\x80\x99ll \xE2\x80\x9Clook like their Dad\xE2\x80\x9D. But for Jews the issue is more complex.\n\
    The two most observed Jewish customs of even the most non-religious Jews\n\
    are circumcision and burial in a Jewish cemetery. Belief in the\n\
    importance of circumcision as a mark of Jewish identity, and so of\n\
    difference, explains why some Jews find the imperative to circumcise\n\
    even more compelling in periods &ndash; like now &ndash; when it is out of favor\n\
    among non-Jews. Jews circumcise not because it is fashionable, the\n\
    thinking goes, but because it is the mark of convenant between God and\n\
    the Jewish people. Jews circumcise because it reflects what we believe\n\
    and who we are. Jews circumcise because they are Jews.</p>\n\n\
    <p>IN THE biographical film Europa Europa, Shlomo Perel feigns Aryan\n\
    identity as he waits out the war in a school for Hitler youth. Afraid of\n\
    being discovered, longing to fit in with the other young men, Shlomo\n\
    ties a string around his penis in an attempt to re-grow his foreskin.\n\
    Although his circumcision repeatedly endangers his life, the film makes\n\
    it clear that it saves Shlomo\xE2\x80\x99s soul. Unable to blend in and forget he\n\
    is a Jew, Shlomo is forced to resist his temptation to identity with &ndash;\n\
    and so be complicit in &ndash; the evil of the Nazis.</p>\n\n\
    <p>As an ethicist and a feminist, I hate the idea of circumcision. As a\n\
    secular Jew, I find the argument about circumcision\xE2\x80\x99s symbolic value\n\
    compelling. I like the idea that circumcision offers boys a physical\n\
    reminder of who they are, and where they belong.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Yet I am also sceptical. As a woman, I lack the \xE2\x80\x9Cmark of the convenant\xE2\x80\x9D,\n\
    yet have never felt tempted to forget or forsake my Jewish identity.\n\
    During the Holocaust, male circumcision meant that the most\n\
    gentile-looking women were most often sent beyond the ghetto to deliver\n\
    messages and search for food and water. While remaining beyond the walls\n\
    would no doubt have helped many of these women to survive, no stories\n\
    exist of large numbers of them forsaking those awaiting their return.\n\
    Perhaps, then, circumcision is but a physical reminder of the more\n\
    important psychic cut that being raised Jewish makes on the soul.</p>\n\n\
    <p>For me, the real dilemma comes from the strange confluence of\n\
    circumstances that have seen me marry and bear children far from my\n\
    native New York. Ten years in Australia have led me to believe that the\n\
    largely secular way I took on a Jewish identity has few parallels here.\n\
    In the suburb outside Manhattan in which I grew up, amid a Jewish\n\
    American community that numbered millions, there were a myriad ways to\n\
    participate and identify as a Jew. My family considered themselves\n\
    Reform Jews &ndash; the least observant level of a three-tiered system in\n\
    which Conservative and Orthodox are the middle and highest rungs.</p>\n\n\
    <p>We rarely set foot in Temple. Yet while my parents were agnostics, they\n\
    were unremittingly enthusiastic about being Jewish. For them that meant\n\
    eating bagels, lox and cream cheese at our Sunday family brunches, and\n\
    scrutinising and rejoicing in our every educational accomplishment. It\n\
    also meant refusing my yearly entreaties to buy a Christmas tree and\n\
    fairy lights, and feeling slightly offended on the rare instances we\n\
    received cards wishing us a Merry Christmas, rather than the more\n\
    neutral Holiday Greetings.</p>\n\n\
    <p>When pushed, my parents thought it would be \xE2\x80\x9Cnice\xE2\x80\x9D if I chose to\n\
    circumcise the baby, but they didn\xE2\x80\x99t see circumcision as critical to his\n\
    identity. Technically they are right. Being born of a Jewish mother, not\n\
    circumcision, makes a boy Jewish. They also knew that in the US, Britain\n\
    and Israel, a small but vocal group of Jews are now opposing\n\
    circumcision. A Jewish scholar recently wrote a book, endorsed by five\n\
    liberal Jewish rabbis, arguing against the practice. My parents\n\
    believed, in other words, that an uncircumcised boy in New York would\n\
    still be accepted by our Jewish peers as a Jew.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But in Melbourne things are somewhat different. The Jewish community is\n\
    small and even its most liberal Reform branches would be considered\n\
    Conservative in America. Those who in the past have raised circumcision\n\
    as an issue for debate have not, in the main, been kindly received.\n\
    Whether this stance is wise or foolish, it is the way things are. The\n\
    way I grew up being Jewish means I will always be an outsider in this\n\
    community. I can live with this &ndash; my Jewish identity is formed and is\n\
    now self-sustaining. But I worry that by not circumcising my boys I am\n\
    making them outsiders too. And this Jewish community is the only one\n\
    they will ever really know.</p>\n\n\
    <p>My friend is also an outsider in the local Jewish community, but while\n\
    he agreed with many of my concerns about circumcision, and worried about\n\
    causing his baby son pain, he never really considered not circumcising.\n\
    Because his wife isn\xE2\x80\x99t Jewish, they were ineligible for a bris, the\n\
    ceremonial circumcision eight days after the birth. Instead, they spent\n\
    several weeks finding a doctor who would agree to circumcise. My friend\n\
    had to hold the baby down, while his partner waited outside, listening\n\
    to the baby\xE2\x80\x99s screams from the other side of the door.</p>\n\n\
    <p>They say they have no regrets, and I believe them. They traded their\n\
    baby\xE2\x80\x99s fleeting pain for his entrance into the history and tradition of\n\
    the Jewish people. I believe in this tradition and want to be part of\n\
    its preservation. I hear the voices of the Orthodox, asking, \xE2\x80\x9CWho are\n\
    you to pick and choose among our traditions?\xE2\x80\x9D But each time I tried to\n\
    imagine the doctor or mohel &ndash; the ritual performer of the circumcision\n\
    rite &ndash; moving towards my baby to make the cut, I baulked. Like my friend\n\
    who knew he must circumcise, I came to know I could not. There were\n\
    reasons for and against, but in the end it came down to the small voice\n\
    in my head that kept saying \xE2\x80\x9Cno\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n"

  title: Why men hold the key to the new feminism
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:38:23
  content_markup: "<p>All workers, not just parents and not just women, need a life.</p>\n\n\
    <p>ONE of the hallmarks of the feminism of Generation X is a more peaceable\n\
    attitude towards men. This is good, because if women are to enter the\n\
    next stage of the revolution, we\xE2\x80\x99re going to need them.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Not that we know it. When women discuss the work and childbearing\n\
    problem, they do speak of men. They note approvingly what a good father\n\
    their partner will be, and how supportive he is of her desire to work.\n\
    But when it comes to resolving the conflict between work and parenting,\n\
    men exit stage left from women\xE2\x80\x99s musings. Few expect men to contribute\n\
    half of the effort necessary to get them back to work after the birth,\n\
    and none see the child-care problem as a shared one.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Women\xE2\x80\x99s definition of the work and parenting conflict is how she is\n\
    going to take responsibility for her decision to work after she has a\n\
    baby (since it is she who is ``shirking\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 what society sees as her\n\
    full-time mothering obligation). Women do not see the problem as how\n\
    they, a couple in which both partners work, are to face the challenge to\n\
    their existing work patterns posed by the birth of their child.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Sex-role socialisation is not the only reason women tend to assume all\n\
    the responsibility for planning and raising baby. They are also\n\
    realists. While studies continue to report improvements over the past 10\n\
    years in men\xE2\x80\x99s assumption of child care and housework, they still do\n\
    less of both than women, even if both are working full-time.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Men also make more money than women and, if a child is to be cared for\n\
    at home, it usually makes more sense for the low-earner to give up work.\n\
    Child care is appallingly expensive. Only women with well-paid jobs make\n\
    enough to cover the costs for just one child and still have anything\n\
    left over, let alone two or three.</p>\n\n\
    <p>At a barbecue last month I met a woman slowly going insane from\n\
    providing full-time care to a demanding toddler and a four-year-old. She\n\
    yearned to return to the part-time secretarial position she had before\n\
    the last child was born. But with the cost of work clothes, travel and\n\
    child care, she and her husband had concluded it just was not worth it.\n\
    ``I just have to wait until they\xE2\x80\x99re at school,\xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x99 she said, ``then it\n\
    will be my turn.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99</p>\n\n\
    <p>Government support, in the form of subsidised child care and\n\
    anti-discrimination legislation, will go some way to making it\n\
    economically rational for women to decide to return to a job they still\n\
    have after they give birth. But only workplace reform will deliver to\n\
    women the level playing field that will ensure their job is as\n\
    worthwhile as it was before they became a mother.</p>\n\n\
    <p>While business lauds itself for providing actual part-time work and set\n\
    the 40-hour working week, few women really want such ``mummy-track\xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x99\n\
    positions. Being on the mummy-track means getting less interesting work\n\
    that, even if done well and in a timely manner, is less valued by\n\
    colleagues and superiors. It also means copping the resentment of\n\
    colleagues when arriving after 9am and racing out the door at 5pm.\n\
    ``It\xE2\x80\x99s all right for some,\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 many sneer, forgetting that the reduced\n\
    hours mothers work means reduced take-home pay.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Others on the part-time mummy-track, still laden with a full-time\n\
    workload, return their status to full-time so at least they get paid for\n\
    the work they do.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Mothers don\xE2\x80\x99t want special treatment at work, and they shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t need\n\
    it. What they need, like all other Australian workers, is better work\n\
    conditions. All workers, not just parents, have a life and\n\
    responsibilities outside work, and all would appreciate and benefit from\n\
    leaving work every night at a reasonable hour.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Once all workers leave early and together, working mothers benefit.\n\
    Firstly, because it\xE2\x80\x99s not only mothers going home to spend the evening\n\
    with the kids, but fathers, too. For working women, this means two\n\
    people, instead of one, to share child collection, shopping and other\n\
    domestic tasks. Secondly, when hiring and firing and promotion time\n\
    comes around, the end of the mummy track means working mothers are no\n\
    longer disadvantaged in comparison to working fathers, the childless or\n\
    parents with older children. In fact, a ``reasonable hours for all\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99\n\
    policy may assist women now parenting full-time to use their husbands\n\
    reasonable home arrival time to support well-earned personal time, or to\n\
    pursue paid work.</p>\n\n\
    <p>And this is where men come in. Because without an en masse challenge by\n\
    working fathers and fathers-to-be to the corporate culture that is (or\n\
    will be) depriving them of active fatherhood, Australian workplaces have\n\
    little reason to change. While trickles of downshifters abandoning the\n\
    rat-race validate our belief that workplace culture is unbalancing our\n\
    lives, high unemployment means employers can replace the drop-outs with\n\
    fresh-faced recruits, and never question the structural nature of what\n\
    went wrong.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Men hold the vast majority of powerful positions in corporate Australia,\n\
    and it is for them that current corporate culture is seen &ndash; and was\n\
    designed &ndash; to cater. By joining together, perhaps in one of the newly\n\
    forming unions for high-income earners, working fathers and\n\
    fathers-to-be could be at the vanguard of the next revolution &ndash; a\n\
    revolution for the benefit of themselves, working mothers, and every\n\
    worker who has things they want to and must do after work.</p>\n"

    they, a couple in which both partners work, are to face the challenge to\r\n\
    their existing work patterns posed by the birth of their child.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Sex-role socialisation is not the only reason women tend to assume all\r\n\
    the responsibility for planning and raising baby. They are also\r\n\
    realists. While studies continue to report improvements over the past 10\r\n\
    years in men\xE2\x80\x99s assumption of child care and housework, they still do\r\n\
    less of both than women, even if both are working full-time.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Men also make more money than women and, if a child is to be cared for\r\n\
    at home, it usually makes more sense for the low-earner to give up work.\r\n\
    Child care is appallingly expensive. Only women with well-paid jobs make\r\n\
    enough to cover the costs for just one child and still have anything\r\n\
    left over, let alone two or three.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    At a barbecue last month I met a woman slowly going insane from\r\n\
    providing full-time care to a demanding toddler and a four-year-old. She\r\n\
    yearned to return to the part-time secretarial position she had before\r\n\
    the last child was born. But with the cost of work clothes, travel and\r\n\
    child care, she and her husband had concluded it just was not worth it.\r\n\
    \\`\\`I just have to wait until they\xE2\x80\x99re at school,\xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x99 she said, \\`\\`then it\r\n\
    will be my turn.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Government support, in the form of subsidised child care and\r\n\
    anti-discrimination legislation, will go some way to making it\r\n\
    economically rational for women to decide to return to a job they still\r\n\
    have after they give birth. But only workplace reform will deliver to\r\n\
    women the level playing field that will ensure their job is as\r\n\
    worthwhile as it was before they became a mother.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    While business lauds itself for providing actual part-time work and set\r\n\
    the 40-hour working week, few women really want such \\`\\`mummy-track\xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x99\r\n\
    positions. Being on the mummy-track means getting less interesting work\r\n\
    that, even if done well and in a timely manner, is less valued by\r\n\
    colleagues and superiors. It also means copping the resentment of\r\n\
    colleagues when arriving after 9am and racing out the door at 5pm.\r\n\
    \\`\\`It\xE2\x80\x99s all right for some,\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 many sneer, forgetting that the reduced\r\n\
    hours mothers work means reduced take-home pay.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Others on the part-time mummy-track, still laden with a full-time\r\n\
    workload, return their status to full-time so at least they get paid for\r\n\
    the work they do.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Mothers don\xE2\x80\x99t want special treatment at work, and they shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t need\r\n\
    it. What they need, like all other Australian workers, is better work\r\n\
    conditions. All workers, not just parents, have a life and\r\n\
    responsibilities outside work, and all would appreciate and benefit from\r\n\
    leaving work every night at a reasonable hour.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Once all workers leave early and together, working mothers benefit.\r\n\
    Firstly, because it\xE2\x80\x99s not only mothers going home to spend the evening\r\n\
    with the kids, but fathers, too. For working women, this means two\r\n\
    people, instead of one, to share child collection, shopping and other\r\n\
    domestic tasks. Secondly, when hiring and firing and promotion time\r\n\
    comes around, the end of the mummy track means working mothers are no\r\n\
    longer disadvantaged in comparison to working fathers, the childless or\r\n\
    parents with older children. In fact, a \\`\\`reasonable hours for all\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99\r\n\
    policy may assist women now parenting full-time to use their husbands\r\n\
    reasonable home arrival time to support well-earned personal time, or to\r\n\
    pursue paid work.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    And this is where men come in. Because without an en masse challenge by\r\n\
    working fathers and fathers-to-be to the corporate culture that is (or\r\n\
    will be) depriving them of active fatherhood, Australian workplaces have\r\n\
    little reason to change. While trickles of downshifters abandoning the\r\n\
    rat-race validate our belief that workplace culture is unbalancing our\r\n\
    lives, high unemployment means employers can replace the drop-outs with\r\n\
    fresh-faced recruits, and never question the structural nature of what\r\n\
    went wrong.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Men hold the vast majority of powerful positions in corporate Australia,\r\n\
    and it is for them that current corporate culture is seen - and was\r\n\
    designed - to cater. By joining together, perhaps in one of the newly\r\n\
    forming unions for high-income earners, working fathers and\r\n\
    fathers-to-be could be at the vanguard of the next revolution - a\r\n\
    revolution for the benefit of themselves, working mothers, and every\r\n\
    worker who has things they want to and must do after work."

    future.</p>\n\n\
    <p>MARTIN Ferguson, the federal Labor frontbencher and former ACTU head,\n\
    argues that to win power, the ALP must re-embrace its core working-class\n\
    constituency: the shrinking pool of blue-collar workers and the great\n\
    majority of Australians employed in routine jobs.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Most working women are employed in such routine jobs, but Ferguson (who\n\
    outlined his case on this page on 14 June) restricts his explicit\n\
    discussion of women to those who ``choose not to enter the paid\n\
    workforce during important parts of their lives\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99. Like the battlers,\n\
    Ferguson contends, these women have been forgotten by Labor.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Ferguson\xE2\x80\x99s view of Labor\xE2\x80\x99s future embraces the coalition\xE2\x80\x99s successful\n\
    deployment of US-style ``wedge\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 politics. His recipe for political\n\
    success intimates that Labor ought to pursue coalition-established\n\
    electoral divisions between battlers and special-interest groups,\n\
    between forgotten mothers at home and middle-class tertiary-educated\n\
    femocrats.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Nice world view &ndash; pity about the facts. The world I live in is one in\n\
    which distinctions between blue-collar and tertiary-educated job-seekers\n\
    and keepers are fast disappearing. Not only is a university education no\n\
    longer a ticket to a good job, it\xE2\x80\x99s no guarantee of any job. Graduates\n\
    cobble together several McJobs, try their luck overseas, or join their\n\
    ``social inferiors\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 in the dole queue.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Among those with jobs, the distinctions between blue-collar and\n\
    ``privileged\xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x99 are even more blurred. Both groups complain of having\n\
    to work harder than they used to, with less job security and fewer\n\
    benefits. Both lack adequate planning advice and savings schemes for\n\
    retirement, predictable working hours, a cap on the number of hours\n\
    worked, compensation for overtime, adequate staffing levels to do the\n\
    job properly, paid maternity/paternity and parental leave, and on-site\n\
    child care &ndash; to name a few. If Ferguson had been paying attention, he\n\
    might have noticed that some higher-paid workers are seeking to redress\n\
    their concerns in a manner similar to their ``blue-collar\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99\n\
    counterparts: by unionising.</p>\n\n\

  content: "Just like John Howard, Martin Ferguson wants to take us back to the\r\n\
    future.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    MARTIN Ferguson, the federal Labor frontbencher and former ACTU head,\r\n\
    argues that to win power, the ALP must re-embrace its core working-class\r\n\
    constituency: the shrinking pool of blue-collar workers and the great\r\n\
    majority of Australians employed in routine jobs.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Most working women are employed in such routine jobs, but Ferguson (who\r\n\
    outlined his case on this page on 14 June) restricts his explicit\r\n\
    discussion of women to those who \\`\\`choose not to enter the paid\r\n\
    workforce during important parts of their lives\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99. Like the battlers,\r\n\
    Ferguson contends, these women have been forgotten by Labor.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Ferguson\xE2\x80\x99s view of Labor\xE2\x80\x99s future embraces the coalition\xE2\x80\x99s successful\r\n\
    deployment of US-style \\`\\`wedge\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 politics. His recipe for political\r\n\
    success intimates that Labor ought to pursue coalition-established\r\n\
    electoral divisions between battlers and special-interest groups,\r\n\
    between forgotten mothers at home and middle-class tertiary-educated\r\n\
    femocrats.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Nice world view - pity about the facts. The world I live in is one in\r\n\
    which distinctions between blue-collar and tertiary-educated job-seekers\r\n\
    and keepers are fast disappearing. Not only is a university education no\r\n\
    longer a ticket to a good job, it\xE2\x80\x99s no guarantee of any job. Graduates\r\n\
    cobble together several McJobs, try their luck overseas, or join their\r\n\
    \\`\\`social inferiors\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 in the dole queue.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Among those with jobs, the distinctions between blue-collar and\r\n\
    \\`\\`privileged\xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x99 are even more blurred. Both groups complain of having\r\n\
    to work harder than they used to, with less job security and fewer\r\n\
    benefits. Both lack adequate planning advice and savings schemes for\r\n\
    retirement, predictable working hours, a cap on the number of hours\r\n\
    worked, compensation for overtime, adequate staffing levels to do the\r\n\
    job properly, paid maternity/paternity and parental leave, and on-site\r\n\
    child care - to name a few. If Ferguson had been paying attention, he\r\n\
    might have noticed that some higher-paid workers are seeking to redress\r\n\
    their concerns in a manner similar to their \\`\\`blue-collar\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99\r\n\
    counterparts: by unionising.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In Ferguson-land, forgotten working-class women \\`\\`choose\xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x99 to remain\r\n\

    interested in equality of opportunity, sex discrimination legislation,\r\n\
    child care and other issues of sole concern to the educated middle\r\n\
    class.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Again, reality rudely intrudes into this antiquated\r\n\

    <p>QUESTION: What do frozen eggs and ovaries, donor eggs, and hormone\n\

    \xE2\x80\x9Cbeat\xE2\x80\x9D their biological clocks &ndash; or may be used to do so in the future.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Julian Savulescu, the director of the Murdoch Institute\xE2\x80\x99s ethics unit,\n\
    contends that despite the risks to women of the drugs used in many\n\
    infertility treatments, fertile women have a right of access to\n\
    reproductive advances such as egg freezing. In giving women the same\n\
    choices as men &ndash; to be educated, to work and to have children at the\n\
    time of their choosing &ndash; Savulescu argues that egg freezing is\n\
    potentially the most liberating reproductive advance since the\n\
    introduction of the contraceptive pill.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Jennifer Parks, in the prestigious feminist journal Hypatia, contends\n\
    that infertility treatments that enable older and even post-menopausal\n\
    women to have children may be the only way for women to overcome the\n\
    social inequities that force women &ndash; but not men &ndash; to \xE2\x80\x9Cchoose\xE2\x80\x9D between\n\
    career and motherhood.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In Victoria, only infertile couples are allowed access to infertility\n\
    treatments such as IVF. However, the use by fertile women of less\n\
    ethically contentious procedures such as egg and ovary freezing, is not\n\
    technically prohibited. More importantly, both Melbourne IVF and the\n\
    Reproductive Biology Unit at the Royal Women\xE2\x80\x99s are willing to speak to\n\
    any woman who wishes to bank her eggs for future use.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Monash IVF\xE2\x80\x99s medical director, Gab Kovacs, has no personal objections to\n\
    fertile women having access to such technologies to preserve their\n\
    fertility &ndash; as long as they are aware of the experimental nature of the\n\
    technology, and the associated health risks.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Both Monash and Melbourne IVF assist women approaching or beyond\n\
    menopause to become mothers using donor eggs and HRT. Melbourne IVF\n\
    routinely treats women up to the age of 48, while Monash is unconcerned\n\
    about age until a woman turns 45.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But while Melbourne IVF\xE2\x80\x99s clinical chairman, John McBain, seeks to\n\
    discourage women suffering empty-nest syndrome from using the technology\n\
    in the hope of having another baby, he is sympathetic to women whose\n\
    efforts to maintain or advance in their job prohibited them from\n\
    partnering and/or procreating in their more fertile years. And McBain\n\
    isn\xE2\x80\x99t alone in his sympathetic desire to help post-menopausal women\n\
    attain motherhood. Last year, Adelaide\xE2\x80\x99s Queen Elizabeth Hospital helped\n\
    a 53-year-old woman give birth to triplets.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It is not hard to see why some ethicists, infertility treatment experts\n\
    and women see infertility treatment as their best hope of obtaining the\n\
    same educational, employment and parenting opportunities as have long\n\
    been enjoyed by men. To access them, a woman doesn\xE2\x80\x99t need to change the\n\
    world, she just needs money. For some women, such treatments may be seen\n\
    as a way to quietly bypass a system that forces them to confront their\n\
    most demanding career hurdles at the same times as they confront their\n\
    reproductive shelf-life.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But, unfortunately, there are a number of problems with such individual\n\
    attempts to beat the system. The most important one, according to McBain\n\

    ovary freezing. Egg freezing has an extremely low success rate. McBain\n\
    worries that women will squander their natural fertility because media\n\

    <p>In addition, infertility treatment is time-consuming, expensive and\n\

    <p>THE horror of the case in which a Melbourne girl was infected with the\n\
    HIV virus through an anonymous blood donation, graphically demonstrates\n\
    the clash between the best interests of the public and the best\n\
    interests of a particular individual &ndash; in this case, a child.</p>\n\n\
    <p>By definition, it is the obligation of public health officials to\n\
    recommend that the community adopt behavior that is in the best\n\
    interests of the public overall. Public health officials cannot, and\n\
    should not, make behavioral recommendations based on risk assessments\n\
    for particular individuals.</p>\n\n\
    <p>When the Red Cross rejected the attempts of the girl\xE2\x80\x99s father and mother\n\
    to donate blood for her operation, they did so in line with studies\n\
    demonstrating that overall, blood recipients are more likely to avoid\n\
    HIV if transfused with anonymous, rather than ``directed\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99, donations.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But while the Red Cross cannot make individual risk assessments for each\n\
    patient needing blood, parents can make such assessments for their\n\
    child.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In the Melbourne case, the parents did just that. Satisfied that they\n\
    had not engaged in any high-risk behavior in the 22-day period in which\n\
    HIV infection cannot be detected, these parents sought to lower the odds\n\
    of HIV infection for their daughter &ndash; from infinitesimal to none.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Behind all public health risk management strategies around HIV/AIDS, is\n\

    \r\n\
    THE horror of the case in which a Melbourne girl was infected with the\r\n\
    HIV virus through an anonymous blood donation, graphically demonstrates\r\n\
    the clash between the best interests of the public and the best\r\n\
    interests of a particular individual - in this case, a child.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    By definition, it is the obligation of public health officials to\r\n\
    recommend that the community adopt behavior that is in the best\r\n\
    interests of the public overall. Public health officials cannot, and\r\n\
    should not, make behavioral recommendations based on risk assessments\r\n\
    for particular individuals.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    When the Red Cross rejected the attempts of the girl\xE2\x80\x99s father and mother\r\n\
    to donate blood for her operation, they did so in line with studies\r\n\
    demonstrating that overall, blood recipients are more likely to avoid\r\n\
    HIV if transfused with anonymous, rather than \\`\\`directed\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99, donations.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But while the Red Cross cannot make individual risk assessments for each\r\n\
    patient needing blood, parents can make such assessments for their\r\n\
    child.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In the Melbourne case, the parents did just that. Satisfied that they\r\n\
    had not engaged in any high-risk behavior in the 22-day period in which\r\n\
    HIV infection cannot be detected, these parents sought to lower the odds\r\n\
    of HIV infection for their daughter - from infinitesimal to none.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Behind all public health risk management strategies around HIV/AIDS, is\r\n\
    the promulgation of distrust of one\xE2\x80\x99s sexual partners, lovers and\r\n\
    spouses. No matter what the status or longevity of a relationship,\r\n\
    people are advised to wear a condom \\`\\`every time\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 in order to avoid\r\n\
    infection. Sharing needles is also a no-no, no matter how vehemently a\r\n\
    fellow user asserts their HIV-negative status.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Such promotions emphasise the impossibility of a person knowing his or\r\n\
    her HIV status, or the status of those with whom she has sex or injects\r\n\
    drugs, not the purposeful duplicity of those claiming to be virus-free.\r\n\
    But while a \\`\\`trust no one\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 stance may be appropriate among strangers\r\n\
    or acquaintances, when applied to intimate relationships such as those\r\n\
    between spouses, it has the hard and unpleasant edge of an X-file.\r\n\

  title: Australians Battle Over Definition of Fatherhood
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:37:35
  content_markup: "<p>Court and legislative battles have embroiled this nation in an uneasy\n\
    search for the definitive answer to the vexing question: Who are dads\n\
    anyway? The deliverers of DNA or the conveyers of care and concern? And\n\
    if the answer is the latter, can the law insist each child have one?</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Women\xE2\x80\x99s Electoral Lobby here recently made history when it became\n\
    the first women\xE2\x80\x99s organization ever to be granted leave by the nation\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    High Court (the Australian equivalent of the U.S. Supreme Court) to\n\
    intervene on behalf of women. The group will be arguing against no less\n\
    an adversary than the Catholic Church in a case that will decide whether\n\
    the nation\xE2\x80\x99s single women will have the option of becoming mothers\n\
    through modern technology.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The case is set to continue on Friday, with the Judge insisting it be\n\
    resolved no later than September 2001.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Victorian federal court had previously ruled in what is called the\n\
    McBain decision that the state\xE2\x80\x99s denial of fertility treatments, such as\n\
    in vitro fertilization and donor sperm, to single women on the grounds\n\
    of their martial status violated Australia\xE2\x80\x99s own Sex Discrimination Act,\n\
    as well as international agreements to which Australia is a signatory.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Catholic Church is arguing the decision should be overturned and the\n\
    women\xE2\x80\x99s lobby is urging the court to uphold the state\xE2\x80\x99s ruling.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Law May Pass in Parliament to Overrule High Court</p>\n\n\
    <p>Hot on the heels of the state court\xE2\x80\x99s McBain ruling, the lower house of\n\
    the Australian parliament passed a bill attempting to undo it by\n\
    authorizing the Australian states to discriminate against single women\n\
    by denying them access to donor sperm.</p>\n\n\
    <p>While two of the country\xE2\x80\x99s three major parties, Labor and the Democrats,\n\
    oppose the bill, the decision by two Labor senators to abstain means it\n\
    may still become law. The Liberal government continues to support it on\n\
    the grounds that children have a right to a \xE2\x80\x9Cmother and a father by\n\
    being conceived into a marriage or de facto relationship involving a man\n\
    and a woman.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>But are the Catholic bishops and the Australian government really\n\
    worried about the rights of children, or those of fathers?</p>\n\n\
    <p>It may surprise people to know that the law has long held marriage to be\n\
    the true test of fatherhood. Paternal rights are accorded to the\n\
    mother\xE2\x80\x99s husband, regardless of whether her child is his biological\n\
    progeny, although society has long attempted to ensure the legal father\n\
    is also the biological father by socially and legally discriminating\n\
    against \xE2\x80\x9Cillegitimate\xE2\x80\x9D children and \xE2\x80\x9Cunmarried\xE2\x80\x9D mothers.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In the last few decades, declining rates of marriage and rising numbers\n\
    of divorces and extramarital births have exerted pressure on\n\
    marriage-based definitions of fatherhood. This is evidenced by the\n\
    increasing willingness of governments to use DNA tests to establish a\n\
    man\xE2\x80\x99s biological paternity and then use this fact to compel him to\n\
    financially support \xE2\x80\x9Chis\xE2\x80\x9D children.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In 1970s, Laws Said Mother\xE2\x80\x99s Husband Was Father\xE2\x80\x94Regardless</p>\n\n\
    <p>However, when widespread use of donor insemination began in the 1970s,\n\
    both federal and state governments in Australia and in other nations\n\
    moved quickly to pass legislation that ensured the mother\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    husband~~~~not the sperm donor~~~~was the legal father of the children.\n\
    Nevertheless, while governments allowed married and later de facto\n\
    couples to use donor sperm to form families, they repeatedly denied\n\
    lesbians and single women similar access.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The reasons are not hard to fathom. According to marriage-based\n\
    definitions of fatherhood, children born from donor sperm to single\n\
    women and lesbians are legally fatherless. And while the current\n\
    Australian government has no qualms about men being viewed as optional\n\
    when it comes to raising children~~~~its press releases repeatedly\n\
    praise the \xE2\x80\x9Cexcellent\xE2\x80\x9D job done by sole parents~~~~its anxieties about\n\
    legally excluding men from the process of forming families are palpable.</p>\n\n\
    <p>How do men want fatherhood defined? Some men seem eager to endorse\n\
    biological definitions of paternity. A U.S. man is currently fighting in\n\
    the courts for relief from child support payments to children he\n\
    recently discovered are not his biological progeny, although he has been\n\
    their social father from birth and continued to fill this role after his\n\
    marriage broke up.</p>\n\n\
    <p>One explanation for declining numbers of men willing to donate sperm is\n\
    the possibility that younger men believe that siring a child makes a man\n\
    a father, regardless of his relationship to the child\xE2\x80\x99s mother.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But what about the children men help conceive, children they don\xE2\x80\x99t even\n\
    know about? Or the fact that, without testing, men cannot be sure the\n\
    children they love and raise are biologically \xE2\x80\x9Ctheirs\xE2\x80\x9D? The fact that\n\
    biological and social fatherhood can be separated means biological\n\
    paternity, on its own, will continue to be an inadequate base on which\n\
    to ground men\xE2\x80\x99s rights to and responsibilities for children and their\n\
    role in the family.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Efforts to Assert Primacy of Marriage Likely to Fail</p>\n\n\
    <p>Returning to marriage-based definitions of paternity is similarly\n\
    pointless. The pathetic attempts by the Australian government and\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cfatherhood\xE2\x80\x9D advocates in the United States to reassert the primacy of\n\
    institutions like marriage~~~~and with them marriage-based definitions\n\
    of fatherhood~~~~are doomed to failure. The economic factors that have\n\
    historically forced women to become and remain married cannot~~~~and\n\
    should not~~~~be reinstated in the 21st century.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The assumption made by those trying to drag us backward are that men are\n\
    willing and eager to marry, have children and be responsible husbands\n\
    and fathers, but women are rejecting men in droves in their eagerness to\n\
    remain single and mother alone.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Fish may not need bicycles, but anyone who thinks most women don\xE2\x80\x99t want\n\
    to live and raise children with men is sorely mistaken. The Women\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    Health Study of 39,000 Australian women shows a staggering 96 percent of\n\
    young women aspire to be in a de facto or married partnership, and 92\n\
    percent want to be mothers by the time they are 35.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This suggests that for the vast majority of single women, to have a\n\
    child using donor sperm is a decision of last resort. As one 37-year-old\n\
    woman in a recent study put it: \xE2\x80\x9COf course, the idea would have been to\n\
    have met the man of my dreams and fallen in love and have it all happen\n\
    the usual way. \xE2\x80\xA6 When I was on the (donor insemination) program (I\n\
    thought), \xE2\x80\x98What a shame I\xE2\x80\x99m having to do it this way.\xE2\x80\x99 But it\xE2\x80\x99s the only\n\
    avenue I have to have a child at this point in time.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>The genie of fatherhood let loose by declining rates of marriage, rising\n\
    numbers of divorces, extramarital births and the radical potential of\n\
    donor insemination won\xE2\x80\x99t go back into the bottle. We need to search for\n\
    new, flexible definitions of fatherhood suited to the future, not the\n\
    past. The best place to start is by asking questions about what men and\n\
    women want~~~~from one another and when it comes to children~~~~and why\n\
    they are having so much trouble finding it together.</p>\n\n\

    \r\n\
    Returning to marriage-based definitions of paternity is similarly\r\n\
    pointless. The pathetic attempts by the Australian government and\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cfatherhood\xE2\x80\x9D advocates in the United States to reassert the primacy of\r\n\
    institutions like marriage~~~~and with them marriage-based definitions\r\n\
    of fatherhood~~~~are doomed to failure. The economic factors that have\r\n\
    historically forced women to become and remain married cannot~~~~and\r\n\
    should not~~~~be reinstated in the 21st century.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The assumption made by those trying to drag us backward are that men are\r\n\
    willing and eager to marry, have children and be responsible husbands\r\n\
    and fathers, but women are rejecting men in droves in their eagerness to\r\n\
    remain single and mother alone.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Fish may not need bicycles, but anyone who thinks most women don\xE2\x80\x99t want\r\n\
    to live and raise children with men is sorely mistaken. The Women\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    Health Study of 39,000 Australian women shows a staggering 96 percent of\r\n\
    young women aspire to be in a de facto or married partnership, and 92\r\n\
    percent want to be mothers by the time they are 35.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This suggests that for the vast majority of single women, to have a\r\n\
    child using donor sperm is a decision of last resort. As one 37-year-old\r\n\
    woman in a recent study put it: \xE2\x80\x9COf course, the idea would have been to\r\n\
    have met the man of my dreams and fallen in love and have it all happen\r\n\
    the usual way. \xE2\x80\xA6 When I was on the (donor insemination) program (I\r\n\
    thought), \xE2\x80\x98What a shame I\xE2\x80\x99m having to do it this way.\xE2\x80\x99 But it\xE2\x80\x99s the only\r\n\
    avenue I have to have a child at this point in time.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The genie of fatherhood let loose by declining rates of marriage, rising\r\n\
    numbers of divorces, extramarital births and the radical potential of\r\n\
    donor insemination won\xE2\x80\x99t go back into the bottle. We need to search for\r\n\
    new, flexible definitions of fatherhood suited to the future, not the\r\n\
    past. The best place to start is by asking questions about what men and\r\n\
    women want~~~~from one another and when it comes to children~~~~and why\r\n\
    they are having so much trouble finding it together.\r\n\

    <p>YES &ndash; Frank Donovan, Clinical Social Worker</p>\n\n\
    <p>NO &ndash; Leslie Cannold, Feminist Academic</p>\n\n\
    <p>Dear Leslie</p>\n\n\
    <p>Our aggressive, competitive marketplace is a reflection of men\xE2\x80\x99s power\n\
    and control, according to the women who want to break it down. How\n\
    serious are they when, far from challenging the system, women are\n\
    clambering to join it in their droves? And what will leading women do\n\
    about opportunity advertising and sex-role stereotyping?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Toyworld\xE2\x80\x99s brochure arrived in the junk mail yesterday: the boys wentto\n\
    war with lasers, power figures,attack cycles, mutant marauders and\n\
    muscle-bound soldiers complete with armor and weaponry. The girls were\n\
    all prams, babies in bassinets, shopping trollies, dolls and a fantastic\n\
    combination oven/cook-top/kitchen assembly complete with smiling girl\n\
    cook.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Given the slaughter in East Timor, the brochure\xE2\x80\x99s gender division of\n\
    military versus mothering was poorly timed, or was it? The marketing\n\
    gurus say that opportunity advertising and sex-role stereotyping\n\
    actually work. Most television advertising and programming confirm it.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Yes, the male aggressive marketplace of dog-eat-dog thrives in business\n\
    as in politics and sport; supported by more women than ever.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So, is it men\xE2\x80\x99s aggression that has to change or just men?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Or should we just keep developing technology that does men out of jobs\n\
    and gets women into them?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Confused, Frank</p>\n\n\
    <p>Dear Frank</p>\n\n\
    <p>There\xE2\x80\x99s no doubt women are eager to participate in the public world of\n\
    work. They need financial independence and want their share of public\n\
    power.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Globalisation creates the insecurity that fuels productivity and demand.\n\
    Will I land a job? Will I be able to do all I must to keep it and still\n\
    find time to marry and have a family? These are the questions that\n\
    preoccupy so many young people, male and female.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Perhaps it seems disingenuous for author Susan Faludi to call off the\n\
    gender wars when men started fighting back. The fuel for change is\n\
    palpable male distress and younger people\xE2\x80\x99s search for non-gendered\n\
    analysis and solutions.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Male aggression is real, and it is not acceptable. It does and should\n\
    matter that women are heavily outnumbered in Australia\xE2\x80\x99s boardrooms and\n\
    parliaments. But acknowledging how the world has come to feel so\n\
    oppressive to all of us is going to require a more sophisticated\n\
    understanding of power and oppression than ``Women have it bad, so men\n\
    as a gender must be responsible and have it better\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Leslie</p>\n\n\
    <p>Dear Leslie</p>\n\n\
    <p>So, if ``the fuel for change is (partly) palpable male distress\xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x99,\n\
    does that mean there might be gain from men\xE2\x80\x99s pain? Well, that might\n\
    make it all worthwhile after all. And if ``younger people\xE2\x80\x99s search\n\
    fornon-gendered analysis and solutions\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 means understanding how we got\n\
    into this mess, and some non-aggressive ways out of it, a lot of us men\n\
    might just be in that.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I especially like the bit about how we all need a more sophisticated\n\
    understanding of power relations than the old ``Women have it bad, so\n\
    men must have it better\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 argument. That will go down with some guys who\n\
    aren\xE2\x80\x99t feeling too flush about things. As for the gender wars, I think\n\
    some of us men might still be struggling with the realisation that our\n\
    old weapons (power, influence, money and control) might be emotional\n\
    boomerangs. To put that another way, how much pain are we willing to\n\
    endure to maintain our fragile hold on power?</p>\n\n\
    <p>My original question still stands, though: ``When there are equal\n\
    numbers in the boardrooms, will women do it differently or will\n\
    oppression and aggression still feel the same?\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99</p>\n\n\
    <p>Encouraged, Frank</p>\n\n\
    <p>Dear Frank</p>\n\n\
    <p>That is a hard question. Joan (Kirner) and Moira (Rayner) think so, but\n\
    there really is no hard evidence. So far, it looks as if putting a few\n\
    or some women into the power hierarchy as it stands doesn\xE2\x80\x99t change\n\
    things.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I suspect that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely &ndash;\n\
    no exceptions made. Some studies suggest ``female\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 characteristics\n\
    like intuition, good listening skills and non-aggression can be found\n\
    among all oppressed minorities; essential skills for managing those in\n\
    power.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Women\xE2\x80\x99s long association with raising children may also explain their\n\
    nurturing skills. But, as men increase their active participation in\n\
    fathering their children, men\xE2\x80\x99s skills in these areas will also\n\
    increase.The values inherent in raising children &ndash; selflessness,\n\
    sacrifice, interdependence &ndash; stand in stark contrast to those of the\n\
    competitive market.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The inculcation of these values in both men and women is an important\n\
    step in preparing men and women to face the real challenge of the next\n\
    century: the destruction of individualist ``economically rationalist\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99\n\
    values, policies and practices.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Here\xE2\x80\x99s my question: do men do, should men do, fatherhood differently to\n\
    the way women do motherhood?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Leslie</p>\n\n\
    <p>Dear Leslie</p>\n\n\
    <p>Yes, I think so. Men have to model different ways of being. Men have to\n\
    model ways of being whole (emotionally and rationally) that many of us\n\
    still have not come to terms with yet &ndash; especially when it comes to our\n\
    sons.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I have never met Joan, though Moira might remember me from WA. But I\n\
    have seen those characteristics of intuition, good listening skills and\n\
    non-aggression among Aboriginal men and women in the north-west and\n\
    Central Desert regions. Seemed to work for them, sort of \xE2\x80\xA6 eventually.</p>\n\n\
    <p>And, in the light of your reminder about inherent child-raising values,\n\
    I guess that takes us to the heart of the challenge. On Friday, I heard\n\
    Sister Anne Forbes interviewed on ABC\xE2\x80\x99s 7.30 Report after her evacuation\n\
    from Dili. She said: ``I just pray we can learn to rule the world with\n\
    our hearts instead of our heads.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 By the time Sunday Age readers see\n\
    our debate, the people she spent the last days with may well be dead.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I guess our challenge is how to reconnect ``the heart\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 with the head\n\

    <p>Cautiously, Frank</p>\n\n\
    <p>Dear Frank</p>\n\n\
    <p>I\xE2\x80\x99m still not sure what different ways of being you would like to see\n\
    men model for their sons, although my own two boys leave me in no doubt\n\
    that it is to their fathers that boys look for a role model. Are you\n\
    saying that women are naturally society\xE2\x80\x99s ``hearts\xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x99 and men its\n\

    femaleness accounts for this. Rather, it is that mothers are usually\n\

    <p>I agree that society needs to cultivate and value virtues associated\n\
    with women such as nurture and compassion. But these value aren\xE2\x80\x99t really\n\
    female any more than their opposites are intrinsically male. We value\n\
    what we know, and what we know comes from our experience. As men and\n\
    women have more of the same experiences in the paid workforce and at\n\
    home, they will come to know and value more of the same things.</p>\n\n\
    <p>These shared experiences, knowledges and values are the basis of the\n\
    joint assault force you propose. To achieve it, we must continue to work\n\
    towards a society in which women and men work as equals and in equal\n\
    proportions outside and inside the home. Equality is the basis of the\n\
    human liberation both men and women seek, and from which both men and\n\
    women will benefit. Ironically, it is only when women and men achieve\n\
    social equality that we will finally know whether and what sorts of\n\
    natural differences exist between the sexes.</p>\n\n\

    human liberation both men and women seek, and from which both men and\r\n\
    women will benefit. Ironically, it is only when women and men achieve\r\n\
    social equality that we will finally know whether and what sorts of\r\n\
    natural differences exist between the sexes.\r\n\

    Here\xE2\x80\x99s why.</p>\n\n\
    <p>ROBERT Manne on this page on Monday (``The state of silence\xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x99)\n\
    bemoaned the apathy of Victorians towards Jeff Kennett\xE2\x80\x99s undercutting of\n\
    democracy. Such indifference, argued Manne, means Victorians must\n\
    ultimately bear responsibility for anti-democratic outcomes such as the\n\
    silencing of public servants, the nobbling of the director of public\n\
    prosecutions and the auditor-general, and the demonising of\n\
    ``quality\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 media such as the ABC and The Age.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Manne\xE2\x80\x99s argument exemplifies the frustration of academic and\n\
    journalistic intellectual elites &ndash; aka the chattering classes &ndash; at our\n\
    inability to use our knowledge and reason to convince ``ordinary\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99\n\
    Victorians to punish the Liberals at the ballot box tomorrow.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Having grown up in Reagan\xE2\x80\x99s America, this frustration has a familiar\n\
    feel for me. Like Victorian intellectuals today, American intellectuals\n\
    back then were aghast at the anti-democratic policies and practices of\n\
    the Reagan administration. And, like their Victorian counterparts now,\n\
    American intellectuals then sought to persuade their countrymen that\n\
    Reagan\xE2\x80\x99s contempt for democracy merited his removal from office.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But more importantly, America\xE2\x80\x99s chattering classes refused either to\n\
    acknowledge or to analyse &ndash; in public at least &ndash; the indifference of\n\
    most Americans to their knowledgeable and well-reasoned rejections of\n\
    Reagan\xE2\x80\x99s demagogic and populist leadership. Indeed, the most profound\n\
    analyses of Reagan\xE2\x80\x99s enduring popularity were that he was made of teflon\n\
    and that the average person was incapable of understanding the\n\
    importance of the separation of powers to American democracy.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Like America\xE2\x80\x99s elite in the 1980s, Victoria\xE2\x80\x99s intelligentsia in the\n\
    1990s have either ignored their inability to stop the rising tide of\n\
    Jeff-worship, or proffered condescending explanations of the public\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    failure to heed their warnings.</p>\n\n\
    <p>With so much ink having been used on the subject of why Victorians\n\
    should vote against Kennett, it may be appropriate to dedicate some\n\
    space to pondering the indifference of the vast majority of Victorians\n\
    to this message.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In my view, this ineffectiveness stems from the inability of Victorian\n\
    intellectuals to recognise and acknowledge that we &ndash; unlike most\n\
    Victorians &ndash; are stakeholders in the processes essential to democracy.\n\
    Intellectuals assume that public policy decisions are, and ought to be,\n\
    knowledge-based, and that we will be the source of much of that\n\
    knowledge.</p>\n\n\
    <p>We believe that democratic participation gives power to ``the people\xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x99\n\

    that affect them, nor necessarily see the value in doing so. They would\n\
    like a fair go, but don\xE2\x80\x99t necessarily expect they will get one.</p>\n\n\

    <p>EVERY woman knows that children scuttle careers. It starts with\n\

    unreliability of nannies (yours had to be the only one who didn\xE2\x80\x99t have\n\
    chicken pox as a child) and the restricted hours of centre-based care\n\
    make you inflexible enough to be passed over for interesting and/or\n\

    ``commitment\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But wait. Can it be that science has contrived to rid women of the\n\
    insistent and inflexible demands of their biological clocks? Hang on to\n\
    your ovarian tissue, girls, because now, at the IVF clinic nearest you,\n\
    it\xE2\x80\x99s tissue-banking time.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Just pop into your nearest IVF clinic, bank your twentysomething ovarian\n\
    tissue &ndash; brim full with fresh young eggs &ndash; and get back to work\n\
    confident that your fertility is just a regraft away. Now you too can\n\
    work like the boys. Into the night. Weekends. Get flown overseas with\n\
    just a moment\xE2\x80\x99s notice. And with no interruptions for childbearing and\n\
    rearing, and no children to temper your zealous devotion to the job,\n\
    there\xE2\x80\x99s nothing to stop you maintaining the pace for years.</p>\n\n\
    <p>What did you say? The freezing and regrafting procedure isn\xE2\x80\x99t that easy?\n\
    Lots of eggs are lost in the removal, freezing, thawing and grafting\n\
    procedures? Nasty adhesions around the ovaries may prevent natural\n\
    conception even if the re-grafted tissue works perfectly?</p>\n\n\
    <p>And what\xE2\x80\x99s this about the unknown long-term health risks of the\n\
    super-ovulation and hormonal stimulation &ndash; and the added time it takes\n\
    to actually get a bub in the hand &ndash; should an IVF conception eventually\n\
    be required? And then problems with mature-age motherhood? Not as easy\n\
    to gestate the little mites when older what with the gestational\n\
    diabetes and blood pressure problems that often dog older-age\n\
    pregnancies. Not to mention the sheer exhaustion experienced by older\n\
    mothers carting the little ones about, and getting up several times in\n\
    the night to feed them.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Of course, infertility specialists are likely to overcome some, if not\n\
    all, of these glitches by the time women now in their 20s are ready to\n\
    re-embrace their fertility. Ways around operative and re-operative\n\
    adhesions, extensions to the shelf life of grafts in older women, and\n\
    even counters to the age-related pregnancy problems and exhaustion\n\
    experienced by older mothers are all future possibilities.</p>\n\n\
    <p>For women, the real problems with tissue banking may be social, not\n\
    medical. Problems closely associated with the pervasive assumption that\n\
    such technologies always give women greater choice and freedom, with\n\
    those who don\xE2\x80\x99t want to participate free to opt out. In fact, while such\n\
    technologies expand some women\xE2\x80\x99s choices, they may severely restrict the\n\
    freedoms of others.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This phenomenon is not new. Writing about his experience in an IVF\n\
    program, academic Paul Lauritzen describes the mere availability of\n\
    reproductive technologies as tyrannical and coercive. The existence of\n\
    multiple treatment options for his retrograde ejaculation turned his\n\
    infertility from a fact of life for which he was blameless to a choice\n\
    to be childless for which he was responsible.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Frozen ovarian tissue grafts will expand some women\xE2\x80\x99s reproductive\n\
    freedom, but at the cost of contracting the freedom of other women to\n\
    choose. Women who truly want to go full bore at work until they hit\n\
    menopause, then have children later in life, now have that option. But\n\
    women who prefer to avoid the invasiveness and uncertainty connected\n\
    with this new medical procedure, not to mention physical and social\n\
    stresses associated with older motherhood, may be out of luck.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Stripped of their reproductive inevitabilities, women who leave the\n\
    workforce to have kids at what their bosses deem inopportune times will\n\
    be seen to have chosen such timing, and consequently be held responsible\n\
    for any resulting inconveniences to the company and co-workers.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Women who ``choose\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 to have children while still young may be held\n\
    solely and fully responsible for any downslide in their work prospects\n\
    during pregnancy and when they return from maternity leave. After all,\n\
    they could have chosen to have children at the endpoint, rather than the\n\
    highpoint, of their careers.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Maternity leave, too, may become a thing of the past. Women who choose\n\
    to have children while still in the workforce, the argument might run,\n\
    must take full responsibility for the career and financial costs\n\
    associated with this choice.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So young lady, get ye to a tissue bank. Or perhaps your union, lawyer\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    office or nearest women\xE2\x80\x99s group. Because, if women ever had the freedom,\n\
    however vague and unvoiced, to conceive children unassisted and when\n\
    they were young, they may be about to lose it.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In the future, all women may need an as-yet-unwritten clause in their\n\
    awards or individual employment contracts &ndash; a clause that gives them the\n\
    right to have children naturally, and at the time of their choosing,\n\
    despite the scientific possibility to do otherwise.</p>\n"

    work like the boys. Into the night. Weekends. Get flown overseas with\r\n\
    just a moment\xE2\x80\x99s notice. And with no interruptions for childbearing and\r\n\
    rearing, and no children to temper your zealous devotion to the job,\r\n\
    there\xE2\x80\x99s nothing to stop you maintaining the pace for years.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    What did you say? The freezing and regrafting procedure isn\xE2\x80\x99t that easy?\r\n\
    Lots of eggs are lost in the removal, freezing, thawing and grafting\r\n\
    procedures? Nasty adhesions around the ovaries may prevent natural\r\n\
    conception even if the re-grafted tissue works perfectly?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    And what\xE2\x80\x99s this about the unknown long-term health risks of the\r\n\
    super-ovulation and hormonal stimulation - and the added time it takes\r\n\
    to actually get a bub in the hand - should an IVF conception eventually\r\n\
    be required? And then problems with mature-age motherhood? Not as easy\r\n\
    to gestate the little mites when older what with the gestational\r\n\
    diabetes and blood pressure problems that often dog older-age\r\n\
    pregnancies. Not to mention the sheer exhaustion experienced by older\r\n\
    mothers carting the little ones about, and getting up several times in\r\n\
    the night to feed them.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Of course, infertility specialists are likely to overcome some, if not\r\n\
    all, of these glitches by the time women now in their 20s are ready to\r\n\
    re-embrace their fertility. Ways around operative and re-operative\r\n\
    adhesions, extensions to the shelf life of grafts in older women, and\r\n\
    even counters to the age-related pregnancy problems and exhaustion\r\n\
    experienced by older mothers are all future possibilities.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    For women, the real problems with tissue banking may be social, not\r\n\
    medical. Problems closely associated with the pervasive assumption that\r\n\
    such technologies always give women greater choice and freedom, with\r\n\
    those who don\xE2\x80\x99t want to participate free to opt out. In fact, while such\r\n\
    technologies expand some women\xE2\x80\x99s choices, they may severely restrict the\r\n\
    freedoms of others.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This phenomenon is not new. Writing about his experience in an IVF\r\n\
    program, academic Paul Lauritzen describes the mere availability of\r\n\
    reproductive technologies as tyrannical and coercive. The existence of\r\n\
    multiple treatment options for his retrograde ejaculation turned his\r\n\
    infertility from a fact of life for which he was blameless to a choice\r\n\
    to be childless for which he was responsible.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Frozen ovarian tissue grafts will expand some women\xE2\x80\x99s reproductive\r\n\
    freedom, but at the cost of contracting the freedom of other women to\r\n\
    choose. Women who truly want to go full bore at work until they hit\r\n\
    menopause, then have children later in life, now have that option. But\r\n\
    women who prefer to avoid the invasiveness and uncertainty connected\r\n\
    with this new medical procedure, not to mention physical and social\r\n\
    stresses associated with older motherhood, may be out of luck.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Stripped of their reproductive inevitabilities, women who leave the\r\n\
    workforce to have kids at what their bosses deem inopportune times will\r\n\
    be seen to have chosen such timing, and consequently be held responsible\r\n\
    for any resulting inconveniences to the company and co-workers.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Women who \\`\\`choose\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 to have children while still young may be held\r\n\
    solely and fully responsible for any downslide in their work prospects\r\n\
    during pregnancy and when they return from maternity leave. After all,\r\n\
    they could have chosen to have children at the endpoint, rather than the\r\n\
    highpoint, of their careers.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Maternity leave, too, may become a thing of the past. Women who choose\r\n\
    to have children while still in the workforce, the argument might run,\r\n\
    must take full responsibility for the career and financial costs\r\n\
    associated with this choice.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So young lady, get ye to a tissue bank. Or perhaps your union, lawyer\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    office or nearest women\xE2\x80\x99s group. Because, if women ever had the freedom,\r\n\
    however vague and unvoiced, to conceive children unassisted and when\r\n\
    they were young, they may be about to lose it.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In the future, all women may need an as-yet-unwritten clause in their\r\n\
    awards or individual employment contracts - a clause that gives them the\r\n\
    right to have children naturally, and at the time of their choosing,\r\n\
    despite the scientific possibility to do otherwise."

  content_markup: "<p>Late abortions are emotive fodder for those who deny women moral agency.</p>\n\n\
    <p>ABORTION is in the news again, and once more the terms of the debate are\n\
    heavily weighted against women. As usual, the anti-choice movement is\n\
    trying to stir up anxiety about second-trimester abortions as a means of\n\
    depicting women as unethical foetal containers.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Those immersed in the abortion debate have long recognised that\n\
    undermining women\xE2\x80\x99s moral agency, not upholding the rights of the\n\
    foetus, is the centrepiece of anti-choice strategy. Examples abound, but\n\
    the most obvious is the anti-choice attitude to abortion choices in the\n\
    hard cases: when the pregnancy is life-endangering or the result of rape\n\
    or incest. If the anti-choice movement really opposed abortion because\n\
    it denies the foetus its right to life, then they would oppose all\n\
    abortions &ndash; hard case or not &ndash; with equal determination. After all, how\n\
    the foetus is conceived has no bearing on its ``right to life\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99.</p>\n\n\
    <p>However, polls show that few anti-choicers outside the Pope\xE2\x80\x99s intimate\n\
    circle believe a women ought to be forced to sacrifice her life to bring\n\
    her embryo to term, or to bring to term an embryo conceived through rape\n\
    or incest.</p>\n\n\
    <p>What the hard cases demonstrate is that what really lies behind\n\
    anti-choice sentiment are mistaken views about the motives, intentions\n\
    and feelings of women who choose abortion. Anti-choice rhetoric abounds\n\
    with caricatures of women who seek abortions: women who abort because of\n\
    their careers or their desires to go on ski trips or get into bikinis.\n\
    The aim of the anti-choice movement is to convince the public to see\n\
    abortion as proof that too many women hold all the wrong values about\n\
    motherhood, womanhood and material possessions. That women who choose\n\
    abortion are, to use Fred Nile\xE2\x80\x99s shorthand, snarling hard-faced\n\
    pro-abortion feminists.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The fretting of anti-choicers about late-term abortions is part of this\n\
    strategy. So while anti-choice concern appears to be about the\n\
    almost-viable foetus, the strategy is really designed to demonstrate the\n\
    incapacity of women to act as moral agents. What kind of a woman, they\n\
    ask, could care so little for her baby that she would choose to delay\n\
    having a termination for so long?</p>\n\n\
    <p>The female, rather than foetal, target of anti-choice rhetoric is summed\n\
    up well by anti-choice campaigner Margaret Tighe\xE2\x80\x99s wonderment about why\n\
    a woman seeking a second-trimester abortion doesn\xE2\x80\x99t just ``go on and\n\
    allow [her] baby to be born &ndash; I\xE2\x80\x99m sure the Mafia would be happy to kill\n\
    it for a much cheaper rate\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The irony is that women\xE2\x80\x99s intense concern for the wellbeing of their\n\
    foetus and others whom they love and to whom they feel responsible is\n\
    behind most decisions about unplanned pregnancies. Far from seeing\n\
    herself as locked in an evolutionary and political conflict of interests\n\
    with her foetus, the woman sees herself as responsible for her foetus:\n\
    its protector, and the only person who can make the best and most caring\n\
    decision about its fate.</p>\n\n\
    <p>A woman doesn\xE2\x80\x99t see her abortion decision as ethically justified because\n\
    her rights override those of her foetus. She deems it ethical only if\n\
    she has made a careful, responsible decision to forgo motherhood because\n\
    she does not believe herself capable of parenting in the way she feels\n\
    is right. Many of the women in my study, for example, felt strongly that\n\
    before they had children, they should be financial, have a partner and\n\
    be ready to take on the responsibilities of parenthood.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Just 5per cent of abortions in Australia take place after 12 weeks\xE2\x80\x99\n\
    gestation. Half of these are done after 16 weeks, the vast majority for\n\
    grief-stricken women with tragic amnio or scan results.</p>\n\n\
    <p>If the anti-choice movement were really interested in reducing\n\
    second-trimester rates, they would lobby to remove legislative\n\
    impediments to Australian women accessing RU486. Ten years\xE2\x80\x99 experience\n\
    in France has shown that when women gain access to the abortion pill,\n\
    the overall number of abortions remains steady, but more are had earlier\n\
    in pregnancy.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The anti-choice movement could also put its considerable funds into\n\
    unearthing and providing all women with access to foetal diagnostic\n\

  content: "Late abortions are emotive fodder for those who deny women moral agency.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    ABORTION is in the news again, and once more the terms of the debate are\r\n\
    heavily weighted against women. As usual, the anti-choice movement is\r\n\
    trying to stir up anxiety about second-trimester abortions as a means of\r\n\
    depicting women as unethical foetal containers.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Those immersed in the abortion debate have long recognised that\r\n\
    undermining women\xE2\x80\x99s moral agency, not upholding the rights of the\r\n\
    foetus, is the centrepiece of anti-choice strategy. Examples abound, but\r\n\
    the most obvious is the anti-choice attitude to abortion choices in the\r\n\
    hard cases: when the pregnancy is life-endangering or the result of rape\r\n\
    or incest. If the anti-choice movement really opposed abortion because\r\n\
    it denies the foetus its right to life, then they would oppose all\r\n\
    abortions - hard case or not - with equal determination. After all, how\r\n\
    the foetus is conceived has no bearing on its \\`\\`right to life\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    However, polls show that few anti-choicers outside the Pope\xE2\x80\x99s intimate\r\n\
    circle believe a women ought to be forced to sacrifice her life to bring\r\n\
    her embryo to term, or to bring to term an embryo conceived through rape\r\n\
    or incest.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    What the hard cases demonstrate is that what really lies behind\r\n\
    anti-choice sentiment are mistaken views about the motives, intentions\r\n\
    and feelings of women who choose abortion. Anti-choice rhetoric abounds\r\n\
    with caricatures of women who seek abortions: women who abort because of\r\n\
    their careers or their desires to go on ski trips or get into bikinis.\r\n\
    The aim of the anti-choice movement is to convince the public to see\r\n\
    abortion as proof that too many women hold all the wrong values about\r\n\
    motherhood, womanhood and material possessions. That women who choose\r\n\
    abortion are, to use Fred Nile\xE2\x80\x99s shorthand, snarling hard-faced\r\n\
    pro-abortion feminists.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The fretting of anti-choicers about late-term abortions is part of this\r\n\
    strategy. So while anti-choice concern appears to be about the\r\n\
    almost-viable foetus, the strategy is really designed to demonstrate the\r\n\
    incapacity of women to act as moral agents. What kind of a woman, they\r\n\
    ask, could care so little for her baby that she would choose to delay\r\n\
    having a termination for so long?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The female, rather than foetal, target of anti-choice rhetoric is summed\r\n\
    up well by anti-choice campaigner Margaret Tighe\xE2\x80\x99s wonderment about why\r\n\
    a woman seeking a second-trimester abortion doesn\xE2\x80\x99t just \\`\\`go on and\r\n\
    allow [her] baby to be born - I\xE2\x80\x99m sure the Mafia would be happy to kill\r\n\
    it for a much cheaper rate\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The irony is that women\xE2\x80\x99s intense concern for the wellbeing of their\r\n\
    foetus and others whom they love and to whom they feel responsible is\r\n\
    behind most decisions about unplanned pregnancies. Far from seeing\r\n\
    herself as locked in an evolutionary and political conflict of interests\r\n\
    with her foetus, the woman sees herself as responsible for her foetus:\r\n\
    its protector, and the only person who can make the best and most caring\r\n\
    decision about its fate.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    A woman doesn\xE2\x80\x99t see her abortion decision as ethically justified because\r\n\
    her rights override those of her foetus. She deems it ethical only if\r\n\
    she has made a careful, responsible decision to forgo motherhood because\r\n\
    she does not believe herself capable of parenting in the way she feels\r\n\
    is right. Many of the women in my study, for example, felt strongly that\r\n\
    before they had children, they should be financial, have a partner and\r\n\
    be ready to take on the responsibilities of parenthood.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Just 5per cent of abortions in Australia take place after 12 weeks\xE2\x80\x99\r\n\
    gestation. Half of these are done after 16 weeks, the vast majority for\r\n\
    grief-stricken women with tragic amnio or scan results.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    If the anti-choice movement were really interested in reducing\r\n\
    second-trimester rates, they would lobby to remove legislative\r\n\
    impediments to Australian women accessing RU486. Ten years\xE2\x80\x99 experience\r\n\
    in France has shown that when women gain access to the abortion pill,\r\n\
    the overall number of abortions remains steady, but more are had earlier\r\n\
    in pregnancy.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The anti-choice movement could also put its considerable funds into\r\n\
    unearthing and providing all women with access to foetal diagnostic\r\n\
    tools that are safe to use earlier in pregnancy, allowing women who\r\n\
    terminate because of a heartbreaking diagnosis to do so sooner.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    And the movement could lobby for policies that would limit the abuse and\r\n\
    ignorance that lead women to delay. An English study recently concluded\r\n\
    that nearly all women seeking second-trimester terminations have severe\r\n\
    social and psychological problems. Like the 12-year-old girl found to be\r\n\
    26-weeks pregnant by her teacher. Her father in prison, her mother\r\n\
    preoccupied with other children (she thought the girl\xE2\x80\x99s weight gain was\r\n\
    puppy fat), the girl said she had been raped in the lift of her block of\r\n\
    flats. It turned out the alleged rapist was sexually involved with the\r\n\
    mother.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But, of course, the anti-choice movement has no intention of doing any\r\n\
    of these things - because concern about the viability or rights of the\r\n\
    foetus is not really the cause of their anxiety about second-trimester\r\n\
    abortions. Second-trimester abortions are simply the emotive fodder used\r\n\
    to gain public support for the goal of prohibiting all women from\r\n\

    Western woman with vanity and consumption (on this page, 6/1) has a\n\
    familiar ring to it. I am 34 now, and for as long as I can remember,\n\
    responsible society has been exhorting me and my fellow female\n\
    travellers to consider what we might have time to think about were we\n\
    spending less time thinking about the shapes of our bodies.</p>\n\n\
    <p>While the description of the problem is accurate, the diagnosis is way\n\
    off.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It is a shame that women invest too much time, emotional energy and\n\
    money in their appearance. But the problem is not caused, as McCartney\n\
    and others suggest, by the failings either of individual women or women\n\
    as a gender.</p>\n\n\
    <p>For one thing, men are fast becoming as invested in their appearance as\n\
    are women. The repetitive advice offered by men\xE2\x80\x99s magazines about how to\n\
    get an abdominal ``six pack\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 and slim down makes this clear, as does\n\
    men\xE2\x80\x99s fast-growing participation in plastic surgery. (They make up\n\
    between 20 and 30 per cent of cosmetic surgery patients.) This is not a\n\
    gender problem, but one belonging to all members of modern Western\n\
    societies.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The philosopher Margaret Somerville describes such societies as\n\
    multicultural, pluralist, individualistic, secular, post-modern and\n\
    post-materialist. What she means is that Australians (and Americans,\n\
    Canadians and Britons) are no longer bound by a collective culture, a\n\
    common religion or a shared modernist belief in the capacity of reason\n\
    and science to fuel inexorable progress towards greater knowledge and\n\
    social and moral improvement.</p>\n\n\
    <p>We also are no longer primarily occupied, as were all humans before us,\n\
    with the business of survival. What all these ``posts\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 mean, says\n\
    Somerville, is that while we know who we were and what we used to\n\
    believe in, we don\xE2\x80\x99t know who we are and what we believe in now. This\n\
    leaves us with a bit of time on our hands and a historically\n\
    unprecedented lack of identity and sense of purpose to guide our use of\n\
    it.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The same existential nasties still plague us &ndash; who are we and what is\n\

  content: "JENNY McCARTNEY\xE2\x80\x99S hand-wringing about the preoccupation of the modern\r\n\
    Western woman with vanity and consumption (on this page, 6/1) has a\r\n\
    familiar ring to it. I am 34 now, and for as long as I can remember,\r\n\
    responsible society has been exhorting me and my fellow female\r\n\
    travellers to consider what we might have time to think about were we\r\n\
    spending less time thinking about the shapes of our bodies.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    While the description of the problem is accurate, the diagnosis is way\r\n\
    off.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It is a shame that women invest too much time, emotional energy and\r\n\
    money in their appearance. But the problem is not caused, as McCartney\r\n\
    and others suggest, by the failings either of individual women or women\r\n\
    as a gender.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    For one thing, men are fast becoming as invested in their appearance as\r\n\
    are women. The repetitive advice offered by men\xE2\x80\x99s magazines about how to\r\n\
    get an abdominal \\`\\`six pack\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 and slim down makes this clear, as does\r\n\
    men\xE2\x80\x99s fast-growing participation in plastic surgery. (They make up\r\n\
    between 20 and 30 per cent of cosmetic surgery patients.) This is not a\r\n\
    gender problem, but one belonging to all members of modern Western\r\n\
    societies.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The philosopher Margaret Somerville describes such societies as\r\n\
    multicultural, pluralist, individualistic, secular, post-modern and\r\n\
    post-materialist. What she means is that Australians (and Americans,\r\n\
    Canadians and Britons) are no longer bound by a collective culture, a\r\n\
    common religion or a shared modernist belief in the capacity of reason\r\n\
    and science to fuel inexorable progress towards greater knowledge and\r\n\
    social and moral improvement.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    We also are no longer primarily occupied, as were all humans before us,\r\n\
    with the business of survival. What all these \\`\\`posts\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 mean, says\r\n\
    Somerville, is that while we know who we were and what we used to\r\n\
    believe in, we don\xE2\x80\x99t know who we are and what we believe in now. This\r\n\
    leaves us with a bit of time on our hands and a historically\r\n\
    unprecedented lack of identity and sense of purpose to guide our use of\r\n\
    it.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The same existential nasties still plague us - who are we and what is\r\n\
    the purpose and meaning of our lives? - but there are fewer givens and\r\n\
    minimal guidance to help us choose from an ever-expanding array of\r\n\
    belief and identity choices. Should we become a Buddhist, or a Wicca\r\n\
    Witch? Volunteer our time to save the environment or build a CV in\r\n\
    pursuit of a career?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    While existentialists such as Jean-Paul Sartre urge us to revel in our\r\n\
    freedom to define the essence of ourselves and our lives, some\r\n\
    experience such vast freedoms and the accompanying panoply of choices as\r\n\
    distinctly unliberating. Confused and without the navigational compass\r\n\
    provided by a core sense of self and purpose, we are vulnerable to the\r\n\
    entreaties of any passing group or ideology that claims to have the\r\n\
    answers.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In capitalist countries, the most extensively promoted and widely\r\n\
    available answer is consumerism. A certain car promises jump-in-the-air\r\n\
    exuberance and certain margarines claim to deliver mothers much\r\n\
    sought-after affirmation and appreciation of their sacrifices.\r\n\
    Particular perfumes or clothing labels pledge to make us feel ourselves\r\n\
    to be a certain kind of person (dignified, chic, worth it).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The products we are told to buy change like the weather. The message\r\n\
    that we must buy something to be something remains the same.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It was inevitable that the pressure to define ourselves by where we put\r\n\
    our bodies, and what we put them in, would give way to pressure to alter\r\n\
    them. Striving for a particular shape at the gym keeps us busy, gives us\r\n\
    a certain self-defining look and helps us achieve the work success\r\n\
    and/or spunky partner that contributes to a socially valued identity.\r\n\

  content_markup: "<p>A lot has been said in the past two weeks about the devastation wrought\n\
    on children by bullies. I wince when I hear the stories, wince through\n\
    identification and with shame.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I was bullied in school &ndash; but I was also a bully.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It is easier to talk about being a victim than of victimising others, to\n\
    speak of abused innocence rather than malevolent guilt. It\xE2\x80\x99s also easier\n\
    because I remember so much more about the emotions and strategies of\n\
    victimisation &ndash; the initial show of defiance that began the bullying,\n\
    the weeks spent hiding out during recess in the library, and the\n\
    negotiated settlement that brought me respite, but turned the heat on a\n\
    new victim.</p>\n\n\
    <p>When it happened the next time, several years later in a different\n\
    school, I waited out my social exile with greater equanimity. I still\n\
    hid out, this time with those on the periphery of my gang forced to take\n\
    remedial English during lunch, but was confident that adherence to my\n\
    mother\xE2\x80\x99s instruction &ndash; \xE2\x80\x9Cdon\xE2\x80\x99t react and they\xE2\x80\x99ll find someone more\n\

    a revolt that landed me in the gang\xE2\x80\x99s Top Dog position.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In America, such a girl wins the epithet \xE2\x80\x9Cmost popular girl\xE2\x80\x9D. I\n\

    ran into a boy who\xE2\x80\x99d been in my year at school and who introduced me to\n\
    his mother with this title.</p>\n\n\
    <p>During those years, I was unaware of the power our gang\xE2\x80\x99s casual cruelty\n\
    or even indifference had over classmates &ndash; they were terrified of us,\n\
    something I learned in my last year of high school. I had dropped out of\n\
    the main high school to become a student at the Alternative (or \xE2\x80\x9CA\xE2\x80\x9D)\n\
    school after ditching cheerleading, gaining a few stones and performing\n\
    other rituals associated with a popular-girl-drop-out. I was washing my\n\
    hands when a fellow \xE2\x80\x9CA\xE2\x80\x9D-schooler casually remarked: \xE2\x80\x9CI remember when you\n\
    and your gang had the biggest screaming match in here. You were there,\n\
    and Amy was there and Cynthia was crying and then someone called me a\n\
    geek and pushed Vicki into a stall and she hit her leg and got a bruise\n\
    mark that lasted for weeks. And then \xE2\x80\xA6\xE2\x80\x9D The story went on and on.</p>\n\n\
    <p>While my new friend recalled every last insult and each casual cruelty,\n\
    I remembered none of it. What sounded like a formative experience for\n\
    her I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t even recall.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The one thing I do remember is the impact the words of a teacher had on\n\
    my behavior.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Flash back to junior high school. I\xE2\x80\x99m 11 and playing Robyn to Cynthia\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    Batman. Back then, she wasn\xE2\x80\x99t just \xE2\x80\x9Cthe prettiest girl\xE2\x80\x9D, she was also\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cthe most popular\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Our prey was Sarah, a girl cursed with parents who were among the most\n\
    hated teachers at school. Sarah\xE2\x80\x99s mother also refused to buy her a bra\n\
    to soften out the sharp points of her developing breasts. These were the\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Ccrimes\xE2\x80\x9D as I remember them, and Cynthia and I made Sarah pay dearly.</p>\n\n\
    <p>We teased what she said and how she said it, we mocked her clothes, and\n\
    the size and wantonness of her breasts. We encouraged the boys, all\n\
    eager to curry our favor, to give her titty twisters.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Ms Moore, a kind grandmotherly woman, held us back one afternoon after\n\
    dismissing the rest of the class.</p>\n\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CYou are both beautiful and bright girls,\xE2\x80\x9D she said gently, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut you are\n\
    behaving cruelly to Sarah.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Cynthia and I protested that it was the boys, but Ms Moore cut us off.\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CI think you both know what you are doing and it\xE2\x80\x99s wrong. The other kids\n\
    look up to you and follow you, if you stop, they\xE2\x80\x99ll follow your lead.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>She dismissed us with a disappointed wave of her hand.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Cynthia was incensed that we had been singled out for treatment when the\n\
    whole class had participated in Sarah\xE2\x80\x99s torture. I listened to her rant\n\

    dangerous.</p>\n\n\
    <p>AMERICAN band Green Day\xE2\x80\x99s Nice Guys Finish Last came in at No. 89 in\n\
    this summer\xE2\x80\x99s Hottest 100 on Triple J. But if the social Darwinian\n\
    theories of American academics Randy Thornhill and Greg Palmer are\n\
    right, some of the guys who finish last in the race for partners aren\xE2\x80\x99t\n\
    very nice guys.</p>\n\n\
    <p>You\xE2\x80\x99ve got to say one thing for Thornhill and Palmer, they sure know how\n\
    to grab media attention. A few weeks ago, they were Dr Nobodies: one\n\
    holed up in the anthropology department at the University of Colorado,\n\
    the other with his face pressed to the glass of scorpionfly cages in New\n\
    Mexico. Now their theories have been headlined in The Chicago Tribune,\n\
    The New York Times, USA Today, Time Magazine, The Washington Post and\n\
    The Guardian. They\xE2\x80\x99ve been on Rush Limbaugh\xE2\x80\x99s radio program, CNN, the\n\
    CBS Early Show with Bryant Gumbel, and NBC\xE2\x80\x99s Today Show, to name a few.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Clearly the strategy of accusing feminist beliefs &ndash; in this case that\n\
    rape is motivated by a male thirst for power rather than sex &ndash; of being\n\
    one-eyed and evidence-free is the calling-card for success with the\n\
    overseas and domestic press.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Unfortunately, both Thornhill and Palmer seem unperturbed by the fact\n\
    that the evidence they provide to support their claims is flimsy and at\n\
    times nonsensical.</p>\n\n\
    <p>They contend that rape is an unchangeable though undesirable biological\n\
    phenomenon, much like a tornado or flood, and that it is about sex (by\n\
    which they mean the Darwinian, programmed desire of all animals to pass\n\
    on their genes). Men who have been unsuccessful in attracting a female\n\
    with whom to copulate consensually use rape as a strategy to pass along\n\
    their genetic legacy.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But the most persuasive evidence Thornhill and Palmer could muster &ndash; and\n\
    I am truly too embarrassed to repeat their less convincing supporting\n\
    facts &ndash; are that most rape victims are women of child-bearing age, and\n\
    that rape occurs in a variety of animal species.</p>\n\n\
    <p>What they fail to mention is that most rapists are also of child-bearing\n\
    age. Not only are these men more likely to have greater access to\n\
    similarly aged women, but women of this age are more likely than the\n\
    very young or very old to be out and about and so at risk of stranger\n\
    rape. They are also more likely to be socially and sexually active and\n\
    so at higher risk of \xE2\x80\x9Cdate\xE2\x80\x9D rape.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Evolutionary academics have a penchant for picking from the natural\n\
    world that which suits their usually sexist theories, and ignoring the\n\
    rest. This means that the naturalness of human breeding and\n\
    child-rearing practices are never explained with reference to the\n\
    extracurricular sexual activities of the female emu, which roots around\n\
    while the male stays back at the nest hatching the eggs. Instead, they\n\
    are seen as akin &ndash; in this case &ndash; to the mating habits of scorpionflies.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The scorpionfly, we are told, has a clamp-like appendage that seems\n\
    specially designed for rape. While no similar appendage has yet been\n\
    located on the human male, our headline doctors proffer this discovery\n\
    as proof of the pervasiveness of rape in the animal kingdom, and so the\n\
    naturalness and immutability of its occurrence among humans. In my view,\n\
    scorpionfly behavior tells us as much (or as little) as does emu\n\
    behavior about what is natural for humans. Call me a nut.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But the strongest piece of evidence the Darwinian theory of rape has\n\
    going for it &ndash; other than prime-time ratings &ndash; is the simple fact that\n\
    many sexual assaults do not involve the rapist penetrating the woman\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    vagina with his penis. And even when he does, he doesn\xE2\x80\x99t always\n\
    ejaculate. In addition, men rape other men, old women and children, a\n\
    third of whom are boys. This, if I am not mistaken, puts the\n\
    men-rape-to-spread-their-genes-around theory in a bit of a bind. It\n\
    means that unless the evolutionary drive isn\xE2\x80\x99t the brightest light in\n\
    the harbor, it is a bad explanation for why and whom men choose to rape.</p>\n\n\
    <p>And if rape is a \xE2\x80\x9Csuccessful\xE2\x80\x9D reproductive strategy, as our academics\n\
    claim, you\xE2\x80\x99ve got to wonder for whom. Sexual selection is a key aspect\n\
    of Darwin\xE2\x80\x99s survival-of-the-fittest theory. Put crudely, it gives female\n\
    desires a strong say in the selection of a species\xE2\x80\x99 characteristics.\n\
    Peacock plumage is a lightning rod for the bird\xE2\x80\x99s predators, yet by\n\
    making the cock more attractive to the hen, the bird with the largest,\n\
    most colorful plumage is at an advantage in the sexual selection stakes.</p>\n\n\
    <p>If a woman knocks back a bloke\xE2\x80\x99s request for consensual sex, and he\n\
    rapes her, he upsets the delicate balance of sexual selection by &ndash;\n\
    should he actually impregnate her &ndash; spreading his ``unfit\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 genes\n\
    around. Good for the individual male in question, maybe. Good &ndash; in\n\
    Darwinian terms &ndash; for the human species? I don\xE2\x80\x99t think so.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Thornhill and Palmer\xE2\x80\x99s reinstatement of the boys-will-be-boys thesis\n\
    about why men rape has upset both men and women. Men are peeved at being\n\
    re-tarred with the all-men-are-potential-rapists brush. Women involved\n\
    in counselling sexual assault survivors are worried that such\n\
    theoretical walks in the woods might reverse hard-won political, legal\n\
    and treatment trends that lay responsibility for sexual violence at\n\
    men\xE2\x80\x99s feet, rather than at women\xE2\x80\x99s hemlines.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But they needn\xE2\x80\x99t worry. Claims by some angry anti-feminists that\n\
    Thornhill and Palmer\xE2\x80\x99s work is being knocked off by an aggressive case\n\
    of feminist political correctness &ndash; the standard ploy for keeping\n\
    anti-feminist agendas in the media for longer than they merit &ndash; won\xE2\x80\x99t\n\
    work for long. Thornhill and Palmer\xE2\x80\x99s thesis simply doesn\xE2\x80\x99t stack up.\n\

    so.</p>\n"

    about a third of managers, professionals and associate professionals &ndash;\n\

    fewer hours.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So why did the women\xE2\x80\x99s movement drop the ball on Howard\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    need-for-better-balance comments? One important reason was the desire\n\
    not to antagonise teachers (most of whom are women) and the teachers\n\
    union, which is a traditional ally. The union came out early against the\n\
    plan because of understandable fears that its implementation would be\n\
    inadequately funded, and so come at the cost of already overburdened\n\
    teachers.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But good mummy/bad mummy politics may also have played a part in the\n\
    speedy rejection of Howard\xE2\x80\x99s plan. Letters from concerned parents and\n\
    children flooded newspapers, defending the well-earned right of children\n\
    to go home at 3.30 to frolic in the creek, pick daisies in the park and\n\
    otherwise rejuvenate.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Opposition Leader, Kim Beazley, joined in the condemnation of\n\
    uncaring parents who might support the plan when he rejected it on the\n\
    grounds that he would ``not want (his) child (riding home) on the\n\
    roads\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 at 5pm.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The sub-textual condemnation of working parents in general and working\n\
    mothers in particular is not hard to discern, although several letters\n\
    spelt it out anyway: children should not suffer longer hours at school\n\
    for the convenience of their career-driven mothers. Such charges of\n\
    selfishness were not only levelled at any woman who would dare speak up\n\
    in support of the extended school hours plan, but tarred all those whose\n\
    children are enrolled in out-of-school-hours programs.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Good mummy/bad mummy politics are a landmine for the women\xE2\x80\x99s movement.\n\
    Many women marching under the anti-feminist or the\n\
    I\xE2\x80\x99m-not-a-feminist-but banners believe, rightly or wrongly, that the\n\
    feminist movement supports only working women, and devalues the role of\n\
    those who choose to defer or play down workforce participation to care\n\
    for their children.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The women\xE2\x80\x99s movement\xE2\x80\x99s support for Howard\xE2\x80\x99s proposal would only further\n\
    entrench these women\xE2\x80\x99s beliefs that feminists see little value in their\n\
    decision not to work, or to work part-time to be there when the school\n\
    bell rings at 3.30.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Limited resources (for example, the Howard Government recently de-funded\n\
    the Women\xE2\x80\x99s Electoral Lobby) is another reason the women\xE2\x80\x99s movement\n\
    would benefit from concentrating all its attention on traditional\n\
    feminist and unquestionably gender-based issues concerning women and\n\
    work &ndash; issues such as equal pay, sexual harassment and glass ceilings.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Ironically, such a concentration may also bring more women back into the\n\
    feminist fold because nearly all women believe &ndash; no matter how\n\
    stridently anti-feminist their rhetoric &ndash; that they have a right to as\n\
    much pay, as much safety and as much opportunity for advancement at work\n\
    as any man.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Bringing men into the fight for work/family balance better reflects the\n\
    reality and ideal of male involvement in parenting. More importantly,\n\
    until working fathers start kicking up a fuss &ndash; and threatening to down\n\
    tools, alongside working mothers &ndash; nothing is going to change.</p>\n\n\
    <p>School hours are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the\n\
    problems facing working mothers and fathers. Working parents missed the\n\
    opportunity that Howard\xE2\x80\x99s comments offered to begin a discussion at the\n\
    community and political level about the degraded quality of life they\n\
    and their children have as a result of the incongruence between\n\
    institutions such as school and work, and the demands of parenthood. It\n\
    may be that we can no longer expect the women\xE2\x80\x99s movement to take up this\n\
    fight on our behalf.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Perhaps, if we use the time until the Government\xE2\x80\x99s next political\n\
    opening organising a new movement for change &ndash; I\xE2\x80\x99d call it Parents for\n\

    The Opposition Leader, Kim Beazley, joined in the condemnation of\r\n\
    uncaring parents who might support the plan when he rejected it on the\r\n\
    grounds that he would \\`\\`not want (his) child (riding home) on the\r\n\
    roads\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 at 5pm.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The sub-textual condemnation of working parents in general and working\r\n\
    mothers in particular is not hard to discern, although several letters\r\n\
    spelt it out anyway: children should not suffer longer hours at school\r\n\
    for the convenience of their career-driven mothers. Such charges of\r\n\
    selfishness were not only levelled at any woman who would dare speak up\r\n\
    in support of the extended school hours plan, but tarred all those whose\r\n\
    children are enrolled in out-of-school-hours programs.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Good mummy/bad mummy politics are a landmine for the women\xE2\x80\x99s movement.\r\n\
    Many women marching under the anti-feminist or the\r\n\
    I\xE2\x80\x99m-not-a-feminist-but banners believe, rightly or wrongly, that the\r\n\
    feminist movement supports only working women, and devalues the role of\r\n\
    those who choose to defer or play down workforce participation to care\r\n\
    for their children.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The women\xE2\x80\x99s movement\xE2\x80\x99s support for Howard\xE2\x80\x99s proposal would only further\r\n\
    entrench these women\xE2\x80\x99s beliefs that feminists see little value in their\r\n\
    decision not to work, or to work part-time to be there when the school\r\n\
    bell rings at 3.30.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Limited resources (for example, the Howard Government recently de-funded\r\n\
    the Women\xE2\x80\x99s Electoral Lobby) is another reason the women\xE2\x80\x99s movement\r\n\
    would benefit from concentrating all its attention on traditional\r\n\
    feminist and unquestionably gender-based issues concerning women and\r\n\
    work - issues such as equal pay, sexual harassment and glass ceilings.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Ironically, such a concentration may also bring more women back into the\r\n\
    feminist fold because nearly all women believe - no matter how\r\n\
    stridently anti-feminist their rhetoric - that they have a right to as\r\n\
    much pay, as much safety and as much opportunity for advancement at work\r\n\
    as any man.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Bringing men into the fight for work/family balance better reflects the\r\n\
    reality and ideal of male involvement in parenting. More importantly,\r\n\
    until working fathers start kicking up a fuss - and threatening to down\r\n\
    tools, alongside working mothers - nothing is going to change.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    School hours are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the\r\n\
    problems facing working mothers and fathers. Working parents missed the\r\n\
    opportunity that Howard\xE2\x80\x99s comments offered to begin a discussion at the\r\n\
    community and political level about the degraded quality of life they\r\n\
    and their children have as a result of the incongruence between\r\n\
    institutions such as school and work, and the demands of parenthood. It\r\n\
    may be that we can no longer expect the women\xE2\x80\x99s movement to take up this\r\n\
    fight on our behalf.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Perhaps, if we use the time until the Government\xE2\x80\x99s next political\r\n\
    opening organising a new movement for change - I\xE2\x80\x99d call it Parents for\r\n\
    Balance - we won\xE2\x80\x99t have to see the next opportunity float by."

    <p>LAST week the Prime Minister reopened the debate about Australia\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    population. After years of Hanson-inspired silence, there are even\n\

    Indeed, some media outlets didn\xE2\x80\x99t even bother to report Howard\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    interest in a comprehensive debate about population, while others gave\n\
    only a one-line mention to his open mind on population. Instead, the\n\
    media focused on the Government\xE2\x80\x99s policy shift on migrant numbers.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Population is not a synonym for migration, so why do politicians and the\n\
    media constantly equate the two? More importantly, who loses out when\n\
    they do?</p>\n\n\
    <p>The size of our population is primarily determined by how many babies we\n\
    have. Over the past decade, Australia\xE2\x80\x99s fertility rate has dropped\n\
    precipitously. Australian woman averaged 1.9 babies at the start of the\n\
    1990s; by the end of the decade the figure was 1.75.</p>\n\n\
    <p>What this means is that each year Australians move further away from\n\
    bringing enough children into the world &ndash; around 2.1 per woman &ndash; to\n\
    replace the number of Australians dying.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In this, we are far from alone. Few Western countries have fertility\n\
    levels that are at or above replacement levels.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Yet despite sporadic fretting about declining fertility in the Western\n\
    world &ndash; an Italian demographer recently predicted the demise of the\n\
    Italian people unless that country was able to halt the fall in its\n\
    fertility rate &ndash; no committees are being assembled and research\n\
    commissioned to investigate the problem and propose policy solutions.</p>\n\n\
    <p>One reason is the difficulty in even gaining agreement that falling\n\
    population is a problem. Some contend, among them the New South Wales\n\
    Premier, Bob Carr, that our current numbers are overwhelming our fragile\n\
    ecosystem and limited infrastructure.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Those in favor of population growth tend to be economic rationalists\n\
    convinced that greater numbers will fuel economic prosperity and lift\n\
    our international standing. In addition, patriarchal societies have long\n\
    seen child-bearing as a woman\xE2\x80\x99s patriotic duty. As Jeff Kennett\n\
    discovered, this can make any mention of the issue politically risky.</p>\n\n\
    <p>If declining fertility represented the desire of increasing numbers of\n\
    women and men to have fewer children or no children at all, I\xE2\x80\x99d fully\n\
    support the current do-nothing-and-for-God\xE2\x80\x99s-sake-don\xE2\x80\x99t-talk-about-it\n\
    approach.</p>\n\n\
    <p>However, what little data is available suggests that the steady decline\n\
    in Australia\xE2\x80\x99s birthrate since 1961 is evidence of the ever-widening gap\n\
    between the number of children we want, and the number of children we\n\
    have.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The problem with falling population, in other words, is that it\n\
    represents an erosion of women\xE2\x80\x99s and men\xE2\x80\x99s freedom to embrace\n\
    parenthood.</p>\n\n\
    <p>For instance, one study found that tertiary-educated Australian women in\n\
    their 20s intended to have an average of 2.3 children each, but as they\n\
    moved into their 30s, their expectations dropped sharply. At current\n\
    rates, these women are not even likely to meet their lowered fertility\n\
    expectations.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Less educated women, while wanting on average just under two children\n\
    each, come much closer to having the number they want. However, this may\n\
    be about to change. New figures from the Australian Institute of Family\n\
    Studies show that while fertility rates are dropping for all women,\n\
    those of less educated women with poorer job prospects are declining\n\
    quickest of all. What all this means is that the longstanding\n\
    relationship in developing countries between higher rates of female\n\
    education and lower rates of fertility doesn\xE2\x80\x99t explain fertility\n\
    patterns in the developed world. It seems higher education and\n\
    employment levels don\xE2\x80\x99t lead women to want fewer children, but to have\n\
    fewer than they want.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The reasons for this are not hard to guess. Getting educated takes time,\n\
    and leads women to put off having children. Getting established in a\n\
    career also takes time, and leads women to delay even longer. Getting so\n\
    established at work that a woman is able to negotiate a family-friendly\n\
    work arrangement that won\xE2\x80\x99t bankrupt her, turn her hair grey or put her\n\
    on the mummy track could conceivably &ndash; in a time of unequal opportunity\n\
    and pay &ndash; take a lifetime.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The limited lifespan of female fertility means such delays may result in\n\
    a woman having fewer children than she intended, or no children at all.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The upshot of all this is that the incompatibility of child-bearing and\n\
    child-rearing with the demands of the lean and mean modern-day workforce\n\
    &ndash; and the aggravation of that incompatibility by sex discrimination &ndash; is\n\
    an issue that bears directly on the population question. No wonder\n\
    politicians are happy to restrict debates on population to questions of\n\
    immigration. Debates on the causes of declining fertility could make\n\
    arguments about migrant numbers look like fun.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But curtailment of this important debate comes at a high cost for\n\
    present and potential parents and children. So, as our political leaders\n\
    gear up for the annual carry-on about migrant numbers, prospective and\n\
    actual parents need to ensure their elected representatives canvass all\n\
    the causes and cures for our declining numbers.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The wellbeing of our families &ndash; and the existence of those we hope to\n\
    have &ndash; depends on it.</p>\n"

    In this, we are far from alone. Few Western countries have fertility\r\n\
    levels that are at or above replacement levels.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Yet despite sporadic fretting about declining fertility in the Western\r\n\
    world - an Italian demographer recently predicted the demise of the\r\n\
    Italian people unless that country was able to halt the fall in its\r\n\
    fertility rate - no committees are being assembled and research\r\n\
    commissioned to investigate the problem and propose policy solutions.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    One reason is the difficulty in even gaining agreement that falling\r\n\
    population is a problem. Some contend, among them the New South Wales\r\n\
    Premier, Bob Carr, that our current numbers are overwhelming our fragile\r\n\
    ecosystem and limited infrastructure.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Those in favor of population growth tend to be economic rationalists\r\n\
    convinced that greater numbers will fuel economic prosperity and lift\r\n\
    our international standing. In addition, patriarchal societies have long\r\n\
    seen child-bearing as a woman\xE2\x80\x99s patriotic duty. As Jeff Kennett\r\n\
    discovered, this can make any mention of the issue politically risky.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    If declining fertility represented the desire of increasing numbers of\r\n\
    women and men to have fewer children or no children at all, I\xE2\x80\x99d fully\r\n\
    support the current do-nothing-and-for-God\xE2\x80\x99s-sake-don\xE2\x80\x99t-talk-about-it\r\n\
    approach.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    However, what little data is available suggests that the steady decline\r\n\
    in Australia\xE2\x80\x99s birthrate since 1961 is evidence of the ever-widening gap\r\n\
    between the number of children we want, and the number of children we\r\n\
    have.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The problem with falling population, in other words, is that it\r\n\
    represents an erosion of women\xE2\x80\x99s and men\xE2\x80\x99s freedom to embrace\r\n\
    parenthood.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    For instance, one study found that tertiary-educated Australian women in\r\n\
    their 20s intended to have an average of 2.3 children each, but as they\r\n\
    moved into their 30s, their expectations dropped sharply. At current\r\n\
    rates, these women are not even likely to meet their lowered fertility\r\n\
    expectations.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Less educated women, while wanting on average just under two children\r\n\
    each, come much closer to having the number they want. However, this may\r\n\
    be about to change. New figures from the Australian Institute of Family\r\n\
    Studies show that while fertility rates are dropping for all women,\r\n\
    those of less educated women with poorer job prospects are declining\r\n\
    quickest of all. What all this means is that the longstanding\r\n\
    relationship in developing countries between higher rates of female\r\n\
    education and lower rates of fertility doesn\xE2\x80\x99t explain fertility\r\n\
    patterns in the developed world. It seems higher education and\r\n\
    employment levels don\xE2\x80\x99t lead women to want fewer children, but to have\r\n\
    fewer than they want.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The reasons for this are not hard to guess. Getting educated takes time,\r\n\
    and leads women to put off having children. Getting established in a\r\n\
    career also takes time, and leads women to delay even longer. Getting so\r\n\
    established at work that a woman is able to negotiate a family-friendly\r\n\
    work arrangement that won\xE2\x80\x99t bankrupt her, turn her hair grey or put her\r\n\
    on the mummy track could conceivably - in a time of unequal opportunity\r\n\
    and pay - take a lifetime.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The limited lifespan of female fertility means such delays may result in\r\n\
    a woman having fewer children than she intended, or no children at all.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The upshot of all this is that the incompatibility of child-bearing and\r\n\
    child-rearing with the demands of the lean and mean modern-day workforce\r\n\
    - and the aggravation of that incompatibility by sex discrimination - is\r\n\
    an issue that bears directly on the population question. No wonder\r\n\
    politicians are happy to restrict debates on population to questions of\r\n\
    immigration. Debates on the causes of declining fertility could make\r\n\
    arguments about migrant numbers look like fun.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But curtailment of this important debate comes at a high cost for\r\n\
    present and potential parents and children. So, as our political leaders\r\n\
    gear up for the annual carry-on about migrant numbers, prospective and\r\n\
    actual parents need to ensure their elected representatives canvass all\r\n\
    the causes and cures for our declining numbers.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The wellbeing of our families - and the existence of those we hope to\r\n\
    have - depends on it."

    inMay, when wife Cherie is due to drop the couple\xE2\x80\x99s fourth bundle. While\n\
    Cherie was publicly expressing her interest in seeing Tony take\n\
    advantage of his right to leave, he was mumbling about his pressing\n\
    responsibilities to ensure the country was properly run.</p>\n\n\
    <p>An astounding 57 per cent of Britons agreed that, while it is a good\n\
    idea for a new father to take time off to help, Tony\xE2\x80\x99s job was too\n\
    important for him to do so.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Of course, Cherie also has an important job. She\xE2\x80\x99s a QC, a judge and a\n\
    leading employment rights lawyer. However, no prizes for guessing how\n\
    the British public would have responded had she announced her intention\n\
    to get straight back to work after the baby was born. ``I have a\n\
    courtroom to run,\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 one can hear her insisting, while she dodges rotten\n\
    tomatoes and the deafening sound of public accusations of bad\n\
    motherhood.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The point, of course, is that despite the calendar showing the year\n\
    2000, many people still hold distinctly 1950s views about the\n\
    differences between the feelings mothers and fathers have about new\n\
    babies, and their respective responsibilities for child care.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Such dated mythology holds that the maternal instinct leads women to\n\
    yearn to provide infant care, and to be uniquely suited to doing so. So\n\
    fulfilled are women by nurturing babies in their bodies and at their\n\
    breasts that they don\xE2\x80\x99t even notice &ndash; little less mind &ndash; the devastating\n\
    impact the baby has on their former existence as a grown-up. They yearn\n\
    to take time out from their careers and to be there at those 3am feeds.\n\
    The symbiotic nature of the maternal-child bond also means the baby is\n\
    completely satiated by its mother\xE2\x80\x99s &ndash; but only its mother\xE2\x80\x99s &ndash; nurturing\n\
    and love.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So where exactly does that leave Dad? Most likely folding the laundry,\n\
    screening calls and worrying about paying the mounting pile of bills\n\
    with no money coming in. No wonder he yearns to stay at work, or to get\n\
    back as soon as possible. It is at work that his role outside and inside\n\
    the family is socially recognised and sanctioned: as paid worker and\n\
    family breadwinner.</p>\n\n\
    <p>While both the British and Australian Governments mandate the provision\n\
    of parental leave (up to 52 weeks for Australian mums and dads, and 13\n\
    weeks for British dads and 40 for mums), only British mums are entitled\n\
    to be paid for any of that. While the enormous costs to working mothers\n\
    of unpaid maternity leave are recognised, the cost to working fathers is\n\
    less often discussed.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The governments\xE2\x80\x99 refusal to ensure adequate paid paternity leave\n\
    reinforces the view that men are dispensable at home, but not at work.\n\
    Few families can afford to go without both earners for long, and\n\
    maternal mythology and the greater likelihood that a workplace agreement\n\
    will ensure the woman gets at least part of her maternity leave paid,\n\
    makes it more likely the person staying at home will be mum.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Swedes solve this problem by providing a full year of parental leave\n\
    paid at 85per cent of the lost wage, at least a month of which must be\n\
    taken by the father or forfeited. By paying fathers and mothers to\n\
    parent, the Swedish Government is reinforcing family-values talk with\n\
    real action &ndash; action that ensures parents understand that their\n\
    contribution as a parent as well as as a worker is socially valued.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Blair has been criticised by some commentators for refusing to make what\n\
    amounts to the symbolic gesture of taking a week or two of paternity\n\
    leave. But taking paternity leave must have more than symbolic value to\n\
    truly transform the social and parental roles of men and women.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Regardless of which way Blair jumps, the behavior of British fathers\n\
    towards paternity leave &ndash; and paternity in general &ndash; is unlikely to\n\
    change until they are told, in both words and dollars, that they are as\n\
    needed and important at home as they are at the office.</p>\n"

    courtroom to run,\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 one can hear her insisting, while she dodges rotten\r\n\
    tomatoes and the deafening sound of public accusations of bad\r\n\
    motherhood.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The point, of course, is that despite the calendar showing the year\r\n\
    2000, many people still hold distinctly 1950s views about the\r\n\
    differences between the feelings mothers and fathers have about new\r\n\
    babies, and their respective responsibilities for child care.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Such dated mythology holds that the maternal instinct leads women to\r\n\
    yearn to provide infant care, and to be uniquely suited to doing so. So\r\n\
    fulfilled are women by nurturing babies in their bodies and at their\r\n\
    breasts that they don\xE2\x80\x99t even notice - little less mind - the devastating\r\n\
    impact the baby has on their former existence as a grown-up. They yearn\r\n\
    to take time out from their careers and to be there at those 3am feeds.\r\n\
    The symbiotic nature of the maternal-child bond also means the baby is\r\n\
    completely satiated by its mother\xE2\x80\x99s - but only its mother\xE2\x80\x99s - nurturing\r\n\
    and love.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So where exactly does that leave Dad? Most likely folding the laundry,\r\n\
    screening calls and worrying about paying the mounting pile of bills\r\n\
    with no money coming in. No wonder he yearns to stay at work, or to get\r\n\
    back as soon as possible. It is at work that his role outside and inside\r\n\
    the family is socially recognised and sanctioned: as paid worker and\r\n\
    family breadwinner.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    While both the British and Australian Governments mandate the provision\r\n\
    of parental leave (up to 52 weeks for Australian mums and dads, and 13\r\n\
    weeks for British dads and 40 for mums), only British mums are entitled\r\n\
    to be paid for any of that. While the enormous costs to working mothers\r\n\
    of unpaid maternity leave are recognised, the cost to working fathers is\r\n\
    less often discussed.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The governments\xE2\x80\x99 refusal to ensure adequate paid paternity leave\r\n\
    reinforces the view that men are dispensable at home, but not at work.\r\n\
    Few families can afford to go without both earners for long, and\r\n\
    maternal mythology and the greater likelihood that a workplace agreement\r\n\
    will ensure the woman gets at least part of her maternity leave paid,\r\n\
    makes it more likely the person staying at home will be mum.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The Swedes solve this problem by providing a full year of parental leave\r\n\
    paid at 85per cent of the lost wage, at least a month of which must be\r\n\
    taken by the father or forfeited. By paying fathers and mothers to\r\n\
    parent, the Swedish Government is reinforcing family-values talk with\r\n\
    real action - action that ensures parents understand that their\r\n\
    contribution as a parent as well as as a worker is socially valued.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Blair has been criticised by some commentators for refusing to make what\r\n\
    amounts to the symbolic gesture of taking a week or two of paternity\r\n\
    leave. But taking paternity leave must have more than symbolic value to\r\n\
    truly transform the social and parental roles of men and women.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Regardless of which way Blair jumps, the behavior of British fathers\r\n\
    towards paternity leave - and paternity in general - is unlikely to\r\n\
    change until they are told, in both words and dollars, that they are as\r\n\
    needed and important at home as they are at the office."

    at one another. \\`\\`The world didn\xE2\x80\x99t end,\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 Mulder mumbles. \\`\\`No, it\r\n\
    didn\xE2\x80\x99t,\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 Scully replies. And, with their arms around one another, they\r\n\
    head down the hall to begin the New Year.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Scully and Mulder are Gen-Xers engaged in the quintessential\r\n\
    21st-century relationship - it takes place at work, is based in trust,\r\n\
    respectful of intellectual difference and shag-neutral. Such a prototype\r\n\
    should be unsurprising for a generation whose youthful reality, unlike\r\n\
    those who came immediately before, included venereal diseases that kill\r\n\
    and increasing amounts of time spent in cyberspace, where the nature of\r\n\
    sex - among other things - is constantly evolving.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So maybe this couple will shag and maybe they won\xE2\x80\x99t. The important thing\r\n\
    is that their relationship neither needs sex, nor needs sex kept out of\r\n\
    it. This love is other than that."

  content_markup: "<p>BREASTFEEDING: what could be more simple? Best for mother, best for\n\
    baby, the obvious and necessary feeding choice for all mums, and the\n\
    only one ethical health professionals can support. Most women reading\n\
    this would find such &ldquo;facts\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 familiar.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The gut-wrenching feelings of guilt and inadequacy that accompany such\n\
    pronouncements might also feel familiar. Because when it comes to\n\
    breastfeeding, most of us feel like failures: either because we didn\xE2\x80\x99t\n\
    try to or didn\xE2\x80\x99t succeed at breast-feeding our babies, or we fear we\n\
    didn\xE2\x80\x99t feed for long enough.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Women are consistently told that the nutritional superiority of breast\n\
    milk makes breastfeeding the only ``choice\xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x99 for any mother who really\n\
    cares about her baby. To ensure the maximum number of women ``choose\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99\n\
    breastfeeding, public health officials, health professionals and\n\
    breastfeeding advocates see themselves as justified in doing whatever it\n\
    takes to ``support\xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x99 breastfeeding and to ``actively discourage\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99\n\
    formula feeding.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Women may decide not to initiate or to continue breastfeeding for a\n\
    range of reasons. They may not feel comfortable exposing their breast in\n\
    public, they may ``fail\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 because of supply problems or mastitis, or\n\
    they may have had enough after three or four months and want to hand\n\
    over primary care to Dad.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The bar that today\xE2\x80\x99s ``successful\xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x99 breastfeeders must leap is\n\
    considerably higher than that needing to be vaulted by previous\n\
    generations. Twenty years ago, breastfeeding was recommended for three\n\
    months. Soon after target was set at six months. Now the World Health\n\
    Organisation says all women (regardless of where they live and the\n\
    adequacy of alternative food supplies) should breastfeed ``into the\n\
    second year and beyond\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99. Accordingly, many Australian researchers have\n\
    begun pushing the government to adopt one-year targets.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The benefits claimed for breastfeeding are also on the rise, although\n\
    advocates consistently fail to disclose the significant controversies\n\
    among researchers about whether such benefits exist and whether they are\n\
    caused (or just correlated) with breastfeeding. Selective reporting of\n\
    research findings is also rife.</p>\n\n\
    <p>My favorite is a recent study that showed that while breastfeeding\n\
    lowered breast cancer rates in pre-menopausal women, it appeared to\n\
    raise the incidence of breast cancer in post-menopausal women. You\xE2\x80\x99ll\n\
    find the former finding in the fact sheets distributed by the La Leche\n\
    League; the latter is strangely absent.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But the biggest problem is that breastfeeding advocates confuse\n\
    decisions about breast milk with decisions about breastfeeding. Even\n\
    women who have no doubts that breast milk is nutritionally superior to\n\
    formula may make an informed and caring decision that, in their\n\
    situation, breastfeeding is not the best choice.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This is because women don\xE2\x80\x99t base infant-feeding decisions only on the\n\
    respective qualities of the milk, but also on the costs and benefits of\n\
    each feeding method to their infant, their other children, themselves,\n\
    their partners and their family as a whole. For example, a woman may\n\
    weigh up the ``risk\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 to her infant of giving some formula at three\n\
    months so she can return to her full-time job, against that of losing\n\
    her job altogether or falling out of the loop because of the extensive\n\
    amount of time needed during the work day to express milk. Not only\n\
    might the woman value her job as an important source of self-esteem and\n\
    financial independence, her income may be essential to the family\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    meeting its commitments to a mortgage or private school.</p>\n\n\
    <p>When a woman makes a decision according to her own values about how she\n\
    is going to feed her infant, this decision merits support and respect\n\
    regardless of what it is. For this to happen, a number of policies,\n\
    practices and attitudes are going to need to change.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The first is the accuracy of the information disseminated to women about\n\
    breast and formula feeding. Such information needs to distinguish\n\
    between infant milk (breast and formula) and infant-feeding decisions.\n\
    It must also either reveal all the confusing and contradictory findings\n\
    and debates about the relative merits of breast milk and formula, or\n\
    report only those findings about which there is little disagreement.</p>\n\n\
    <p>There also needs to be changes in workplace structure and attitudes to\n\
    enable women who want to breastfeed to do so for as long as they wish\n\
    without fear of losing their job. Extended paid parental leave is the\n\
    most critical of these, but proper workplace facilities in which women\n\
    can take adequate nursing breaks during the day are also important.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But such changes do not mean all women will choose to initiate\n\
    breastfeeding or to feed for extended periods of time. Health officials\n\
    and professionals who believe it would be unethical to support anything\n\
    but breastfeeding must seriously rethink the meaning of ethical and\n\
    professional behavior when it comes to caring for new mothers. It is\n\
    unethical for health professionals to use their considerable power and\n\
    authority to coerce (subtly or otherwise) competent and informed women\n\
    to make decisions that accord with the health professional\xE2\x80\x99s view of\n\
    what is right.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It is even more unethical for such professionals to refuse to respect,\n\
    to withdraw support from, or seek to undermine women\xE2\x80\x99s decisions they\n\
    deem ``wrong\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99. Their moral and professional responsibility is to help\n\
    women understand the information women see as relevant to their\n\
    decision, and then to respect women\xE2\x80\x99s capacity as competent informed\n\
    adults to make the best decision for them.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Ah, respect for female autonomy and moral agency. What could be more\n\
    simple?</p>\n"

    considerably higher than that needing to be vaulted by previous\r\n\
    generations. Twenty years ago, breastfeeding was recommended for three\r\n\
    months. Soon after target was set at six months. Now the World Health\r\n\
    Organisation says all women (regardless of where they live and the\r\n\
    adequacy of alternative food supplies) should breastfeed \\`\\`into the\r\n\
    second year and beyond\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99. Accordingly, many Australian researchers have\r\n\
    begun pushing the government to adopt one-year targets.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The benefits claimed for breastfeeding are also on the rise, although\r\n\
    advocates consistently fail to disclose the significant controversies\r\n\
    among researchers about whether such benefits exist and whether they are\r\n\
    caused (or just correlated) with breastfeeding. Selective reporting of\r\n\
    research findings is also rife.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    My favorite is a recent study that showed that while breastfeeding\r\n\
    lowered breast cancer rates in pre-menopausal women, it appeared to\r\n\
    raise the incidence of breast cancer in post-menopausal women. You\xE2\x80\x99ll\r\n\
    find the former finding in the fact sheets distributed by the La Leche\r\n\
    League; the latter is strangely absent.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But the biggest problem is that breastfeeding advocates confuse\r\n\
    decisions about breast milk with decisions about breastfeeding. Even\r\n\
    women who have no doubts that breast milk is nutritionally superior to\r\n\
    formula may make an informed and caring decision that, in their\r\n\
    situation, breastfeeding is not the best choice.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This is because women don\xE2\x80\x99t base infant-feeding decisions only on the\r\n\
    respective qualities of the milk, but also on the costs and benefits of\r\n\
    each feeding method to their infant, their other children, themselves,\r\n\
    their partners and their family as a whole. For example, a woman may\r\n\
    weigh up the \\`\\`risk\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 to her infant of giving some formula at three\r\n\
    months so she can return to her full-time job, against that of losing\r\n\
    her job altogether or falling out of the loop because of the extensive\r\n\
    amount of time needed during the work day to express milk. Not only\r\n\
    might the woman value her job as an important source of self-esteem and\r\n\
    financial independence, her income may be essential to the family\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    meeting its commitments to a mortgage or private school.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    When a woman makes a decision according to her own values about how she\r\n\
    is going to feed her infant, this decision merits support and respect\r\n\
    regardless of what it is. For this to happen, a number of policies,\r\n\
    practices and attitudes are going to need to change.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The first is the accuracy of the information disseminated to women about\r\n\
    breast and formula feeding. Such information needs to distinguish\r\n\
    between infant milk (breast and formula) and infant-feeding decisions.\r\n\
    It must also either reveal all the confusing and contradictory findings\r\n\
    and debates about the relative merits of breast milk and formula, or\r\n\
    report only those findings about which there is little disagreement.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    There also needs to be changes in workplace structure and attitudes to\r\n\
    enable women who want to breastfeed to do so for as long as they wish\r\n\
    without fear of losing their job. Extended paid parental leave is the\r\n\
    most critical of these, but proper workplace facilities in which women\r\n\
    can take adequate nursing breaks during the day are also important.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But such changes do not mean all women will choose to initiate\r\n\
    breastfeeding or to feed for extended periods of time. Health officials\r\n\
    and professionals who believe it would be unethical to support anything\r\n\
    but breastfeeding must seriously rethink the meaning of ethical and\r\n\
    professional behavior when it comes to caring for new mothers. It is\r\n\
    unethical for health professionals to use their considerable power and\r\n\
    authority to coerce (subtly or otherwise) competent and informed women\r\n\
    to make decisions that accord with the health professional\xE2\x80\x99s view of\r\n\
    what is right.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It is even more unethical for such professionals to refuse to respect,\r\n\
    to withdraw support from, or seek to undermine women\xE2\x80\x99s decisions they\r\n\
    deem \\`\\`wrong\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99. Their moral and professional responsibility is to help\r\n\
    women understand the information women see as relevant to their\r\n\
    decision, and then to respect women\xE2\x80\x99s capacity as competent informed\r\n\
    adults to make the best decision for them.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Ah, respect for female autonomy and moral agency. What could be more\r\n\
    simple?"

    <p>Abortion is in the criminal code in many states in Australia, including\n\
    the state of Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital. However, in\n\
    1969 the state court ruled that abortion was defensible if the doctor\n\
    honestly believed on reasonable grounds that it was necessary to\n\
    preserve the woman\xE2\x80\x99s physical or mental health. While this judgements\n\
    has resulted in Victorian women having good access to safe termination\n\
    services early in pregnancy, it also clearly established abortion as a\n\
    medical prerogative, not a woman\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cchoice,\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cright.\xE2\x80\x9D Indeed, after\n\
    the story of the 32-week abortion was leaked to the press, the Royal\n\
    Women\xE2\x80\x99s quickly established an inquiry to reassure the public that they\n\
    would be assessing the reasons doctors had for performing the\n\
    termination.</p>\n\n\
    <p>News reports of the complex case at the Royal Women\xE2\x80\x99s &ndash; about which\n\
    nothing has been heard from the woman herself &ndash; have focused less on the\n\
    legal aspects of the case, and more on the ethical issues usually seen\n\
    to surround late-term abortions: the late gestational age of the fetus\n\
    and the seriousness of its predicted disability. While only 5 per cent\n\
    of terminations are performed after 14 weeks, around half of these are\n\
    done because of potential damage to the fetus.</p>\n\n\
    <p>My research suggests that while most women see abortion as a moral\n\
    issue, they nominate different ethical concerns to the masculinist ones\n\
    mainstream academics and journalists glibly presume to be at issue. Such\n\
    views equate \xE2\x80\x9Cviable\xE2\x80\x9D fetuses with babies born, and consequently reduce\n\
    pregnancy to an issue of \xE2\x80\x9Cfetal location.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Women, not surprisingly, see the relationship between mother and fetus\n\
    as meaningful and at the heart of the moral issues that surround\n\
    abortion. Many see the pregnant woman as morally obliged to commit as\n\
    early as possible either to gestating the fetus and raising the child\n\
    that results, or to obtaining a termination.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Royal Women\xE2\x80\x99s case demonstrates how social and medical attitudes and\n\
    practices surrounding pregnancy may, by imposing alternative ethical\n\
    requirements on pregnant women, alienate them from their own intuitive\n\
    understanding of the range and limits of the moral obligations that\n\
    arise from the \xE2\x80\x9Cpregnant relationship:\xE2\x80\x9D the evolving relationship\n\
    between the pregnant woman and her fetus.</p>\n\n\
    <p>During pregnancy a woman is becoming a mother, a process she completes\n\
    when the child is born. At the center of this becoming is her evolving\n\
    relationship with her fetus. For most women this relationship is\n\
    initially only known, not felt (\xE2\x80\x9CThe line in the box on the stick says I\n\
    am pregnant but I don\xE2\x80\x99t feel anything.\xE2\x80\x9D), but it comes to occupy the\n\
    center of her thoughts, dreams, hopes and body by the time the baby is\n\
    due. Most women increasingly come to love the fetus inside them as it\n\
    progressively makes its presence felt in her body and life. As time goes\n\
    on, they grow eager for the baby to emerge from their bodies, where they\n\
    will \xE2\x80\x9Cconsummate\xE2\x80\x9D the relationship begun in-utero, through sight, smell,\n\
    touch and nurture.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The existence and practice of antenatal screening imposes other ethical\n\
    imperatives on women, while the limitations of the screens may hinder\n\
    the normal development of the relationship between mother and fetus.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Ethicist Paul Laurtizen believes the mere existence of medical\n\
    technology can compel people to \xE2\x80\x9Cchoose\xE2\x80\x9D it. In other words, if a woman\n\
    does not choose to have a pre-natal screen and she gives birth to a\n\
    disabled child, some will see her as having chosen to have a child with\n\
    a disability (and therefore as solely responsible for the social and\n\
    financial costs of its care).</p>\n\n\
    <p>The vast majority of doctors are enthusiastic supporters of antenatal\n\
    screening. They assume women do and should choose these tests only when\n\
    they are willing to terminate a fetus with a disability, and many expect\n\
    and encourage women to choose termination when test results are\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cnegative.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>This enthusiasm takes place against a backdrop of social\n\

    <p>However, some antenatal tests, such as the one for dwarfism, can only be\n\

    <p>What\xE2\x80\x99s happening in cultural politics? All we find out is filtered\n\
    through the eyes and ears of people whose formative experiences occurred\n\
    at least 20 years ago. They seem to have grown conservative and dull,\n\
    and are frightened of new ideas. A gulf has opened between what they are\n\
    saying and what younger people are thinking.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Mark Davis, Gangland (Allen &amp; Unwin, 1997)</p>\n\n\
    <p>``WHY don\xE2\x80\x99t they all shut up already?\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 wonders a friend as the papers\n\
    erupt again with the familiar anti-working woman/anti-child-care\n\
    diatribes of the previous generation. While the impetus for these\n\
    flare-ups varies, the parameters and content of the debate never change.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The same old questions about women, work and the care of children are\n\
    being asked and answered by the same old people: ageing baby-boom\n\
    journalists and academics who raised their young families in the 1970s\n\
    and \xE2\x80\x9880s on the basis of advice they received from the child-development\n\
    ``experts\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 of the \xE2\x80\x9950s.</p>\n\n\
    <p>These child-care dinosaurs share a number of assumptions and values.\n\
    They assume that the care middle-class mothers give their kids is the\n\
    ``gold standard\xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x99 and thus all middle-class mothers should provide all\n\
    of the care for their children, especially those under five. Because\n\
    mothers ``should\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 be caring for their children, dinosaur thinking\n\
    proceeds, they are the ones that ``leave them\xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x99 in child care and are\n\
    consequently responsible for the ``consequences\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99.</p>\n\n\
    <p>These assumptions and values lead the dinosaurs to keep asking the same\n\
    questions they\xE2\x80\x99ve been asking since the late 1960s: should women/mothers\n\
    work?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Of course, back in the 21st century, few members of Gen X and Gen Y &ndash;\n\
    those currently considering parenthood or raising young children &ndash; can\n\
    relate to these assumptions and values, or the questions they generate.\n\
    As recent large-scale, longitudinal studies of Australian women and my\n\
    own research demonstrate, younger women assume the role of work in their\n\
    life and value paid employment as an important source of identity and\n\
    independence.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In contrast with their baby-boomer predecessors, increasing numbers of\n\
    young men are comfortable with women\xE2\x80\x99s educational achievements and\n\
    supportive of their career aspirations. For most of them, the question\n\
    ``should women/mothers work?\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 is laughable and the assumption that\n\
    only a child\xE2\x80\x99s mother is capable of providing excellent care is dubious.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Indeed, recent evidence suggests a considerable number of young men,\n\
    possibly up to a third, want to be and believe they should be active\n\
    fathers: sharing the work of breadwinning and the hands-on work of\n\

  content: "Dated views about women and work are deservedly dying out.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    What\xE2\x80\x99s happening in cultural politics? All we find out is filtered\r\n\
    through the eyes and ears of people whose formative experiences occurred\r\n\
    at least 20 years ago. They seem to have grown conservative and dull,\r\n\
    and are frightened of new ideas. A gulf has opened between what they are\r\n\
    saying and what younger people are thinking.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Mark Davis, Gangland (Allen & Unwin, 1997)\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \\`\\`WHY don\xE2\x80\x99t they all shut up already?\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 wonders a friend as the papers\r\n\
    erupt again with the familiar anti-working woman/anti-child-care\r\n\
    diatribes of the previous generation. While the impetus for these\r\n\
    flare-ups varies, the parameters and content of the debate never change.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The same old questions about women, work and the care of children are\r\n\
    being asked and answered by the same old people: ageing baby-boom\r\n\
    journalists and academics who raised their young families in the 1970s\r\n\
    and \xE2\x80\x9880s on the basis of advice they received from the child-development\r\n\
    \\`\\`experts\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 of the \xE2\x80\x9950s.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    These child-care dinosaurs share a number of assumptions and values.\r\n\
    They assume that the care middle-class mothers give their kids is the\r\n\
    \\`\\`gold standard\xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x99 and thus all middle-class mothers should provide all\r\n\
    of the care for their children, especially those under five. Because\r\n\
    mothers \\`\\`should\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 be caring for their children, dinosaur thinking\r\n\
    proceeds, they are the ones that \\`\\`leave them\xE2\x80\x98\xE2\x80\x99 in child care and are\r\n\
    consequently responsible for the \\`\\`consequences\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    These assumptions and values lead the dinosaurs to keep asking the same\r\n\
    questions they\xE2\x80\x99ve been asking since the late 1960s: should women/mothers\r\n\
    work?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Of course, back in the 21st century, few members of Gen X and Gen Y -\r\n\
    those currently considering parenthood or raising young children - can\r\n\
    relate to these assumptions and values, or the questions they generate.\r\n\
    As recent large-scale, longitudinal studies of Australian women and my\r\n\
    own research demonstrate, younger women assume the role of work in their\r\n\
    life and value paid employment as an important source of identity and\r\n\
    independence.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In contrast with their baby-boomer predecessors, increasing numbers of\r\n\
    young men are comfortable with women\xE2\x80\x99s educational achievements and\r\n\
    supportive of their career aspirations. For most of them, the question\r\n\
    \\`\\`should women/mothers work?\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99 is laughable and the assumption that\r\n\
    only a child\xE2\x80\x99s mother is capable of providing excellent care is dubious.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Indeed, recent evidence suggests a considerable number of young men,\r\n\
    possibly up to a third, want to be and believe they should be active\r\n\
    fathers: sharing the work of breadwinning and the hands-on work of\r\n\
    caring for children with their partners. In such relationships, both\r\n\
    parents make, and share responsibility for, decisions to share the care\r\n\
    of their children with one another and with granny and/or a paid carer.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Because many Gen Xers and Yers assume both parents do and should engage\r\n\
    in paid employment and share responsibility for child care, the\r\n\
    questions they\xE2\x80\x99d like to see asked and answered revolve around the\r\n\
    proper division of work and care responsibilities. How should parents\r\n\
    divide these tasks between themselves? What role should the state and/or\r\n\

  content_markup: "<p>Feminists expect fathers to do domestic work, so how can they tacitly\n\
    exempt mothers from paid work?</p>\n\n\
    <p>THIS is how I remember a conversation last week between me and two other\n\
    mothers of grade 1 children:</p>\n\n\
    <p>Mother 1: Does your child sleep at night?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Me: Yes, why? Doesn\xE2\x80\x99t yours?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Mother 1: She gets up two or three times a night.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Me: I think it\xE2\x80\x99s because I did some \xE2\x80\x9Ccontrolled comfort\xE2\x80\x9D with him when\n\
    he was little; it teaches them how to put themselves back to sleep when\n\
    they wake up.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Mother 2: I think \xE2\x80\x9Ccontrolled comfort\xE2\x80\x9D is barbaric.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Mother 1: Well, I\xE2\x80\x99m just exhausted.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Mother 2: Me too. Actually, half the time she sleeps in my bed. That\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    why I could never get a job. I\xE2\x80\x99m too exhausted: motherhood is my\n\
    full-time job.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Is it really barbaric to set limits for your children? To expect them\n\
    to, say, put themselves to sleep and to sleep in their own bed? Or is it\n\
    simply weak and self-indulgent to refuse to draw the line, and to\n\
    characterise this refusal as evidence of maternal love and dedication?</p>\n\n\
    <p>This is not an idle question (although I am sure some of you are wishing\n\
    I\xE2\x80\x99d left it idling). Rather, it is an explosive issue that the women\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    movement has long sought to stifle with the rhetoric of \xE2\x80\x9Cchoice\xE2\x80\x9D. So\n\
    while feminists have long struggled to enshrine all women\xE2\x80\x99s social\n\
    freedom and legal right to work, regardless of whether they are married\n\
    and/or mothers, most have argued that the decision to engage in paid\n\
    work or to make motherhood a full-time job is a woman\xE2\x80\x99s prerogative.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But which mothers exercise this prerogative? Not working-class married\n\
    ones whose wage is the only thing that keeps the family income above the\n\
    poverty line. And not, since the most recent federal budget, the single\n\
    woman of school-age children whose mutual obligation to society now\n\
    demands she enter the workforce, or be in the process of becoming\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cjob-ready\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>No, the opportunity of making motherhood a long-term job is available\n\
    only to women who are either independently wealthy or whose husbands\xE2\x80\x99\n\
    salaries push them safely into the \xE2\x80\x9Cmiddle class\xE2\x80\x9D. Only middle-class\n\
    women are socially lauded as \xE2\x80\x9Cgood\xE2\x80\x9D mothers for refusing to engage in\n\
    paid work, while working-class women doing the same thing are labelled\n\

  content: "Feminists expect fathers to do domestic work, so how can they tacitly\r\n\
    exempt mothers from paid work?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    THIS is how I remember a conversation last week between me and two other\r\n\
    mothers of grade 1 children:\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Mother 1: Does your child sleep at night?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Me: Yes, why? Doesn\xE2\x80\x99t yours?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Mother 1: She gets up two or three times a night.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Me: I think it\xE2\x80\x99s because I did some \xE2\x80\x9Ccontrolled comfort\xE2\x80\x9D with him when\r\n\
    he was little; it teaches them how to put themselves back to sleep when\r\n\
    they wake up.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Mother 2: I think \xE2\x80\x9Ccontrolled comfort\xE2\x80\x9D is barbaric.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Mother 1: Well, I\xE2\x80\x99m just exhausted.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Mother 2: Me too. Actually, half the time she sleeps in my bed. That\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    why I could never get a job. I\xE2\x80\x99m too exhausted: motherhood is my\r\n\
    full-time job.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Is it really barbaric to set limits for your children? To expect them\r\n\
    to, say, put themselves to sleep and to sleep in their own bed? Or is it\r\n\
    simply weak and self-indulgent to refuse to draw the line, and to\r\n\
    characterise this refusal as evidence of maternal love and dedication?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This is not an idle question (although I am sure some of you are wishing\r\n\
    I\xE2\x80\x99d left it idling). Rather, it is an explosive issue that the women\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    movement has long sought to stifle with the rhetoric of \xE2\x80\x9Cchoice\xE2\x80\x9D. So\r\n\
    while feminists have long struggled to enshrine all women\xE2\x80\x99s social\r\n\
    freedom and legal right to work, regardless of whether they are married\r\n\
    and/or mothers, most have argued that the decision to engage in paid\r\n\
    work or to make motherhood a full-time job is a woman\xE2\x80\x99s prerogative.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But which mothers exercise this prerogative? Not working-class married\r\n\
    ones whose wage is the only thing that keeps the family income above the\r\n\
    poverty line. And not, since the most recent federal budget, the single\r\n\
    woman of school-age children whose mutual obligation to society now\r\n\
    demands she enter the workforce, or be in the process of becoming\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cjob-ready\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    No, the opportunity of making motherhood a long-term job is available\r\n\
    only to women who are either independently wealthy or whose husbands\xE2\x80\x99\r\n\
    salaries push them safely into the \xE2\x80\x9Cmiddle class\xE2\x80\x9D. Only middle-class\r\n\
    women are socially lauded as \xE2\x80\x9Cgood\xE2\x80\x9D mothers for refusing to engage in\r\n\
    paid work, while working-class women doing the same thing are labelled\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cunemployed\xE2\x80\x9D or - if receiving benefits - \xE2\x80\x9Cdole bludgers\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So are unemployed middle-class women of older children really \xE2\x80\x9Cgood\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    mothers or are they women unable to enter the workforce - at least at\r\n\
    the level they would be forced to start back on, having spent so many\r\n\

    Australia for services to journalism and women, to write about the most\n\
    pressing social problem of our time: the tragic imbalance between work\n\

    the problem, as well as diligent hand-wringing and sympathetic clucking\n\
    noises from the Howard government. Yet while the problem seems to worsen\n\
    almost hourly, the Government does nothing. The reason for this, Summers\n\
    explains, is that the Government\xE2\x80\x99s ideological preference for\n\
    traditional family arrangements &ndash; where Daddy brings home the bacon and\n\
    Mum cares for house and kids &ndash; precludes it from implementing policies\n\

    those with only one. Summers argues that Australian women are often\n\
    unaware of such discriminatory policies because of the government\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    decision to either eliminate or enfeeble the agencies that in the past\n\
    not only would have publicly argued against them, bout kept ongoing tabs\n\
    on the impact they were having on women\xE2\x80\x99s equality.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Close to forty years on the political stage has done nothing to taint or\n\

    not afraid to name names in her expansive discussion of how both Labour\n\
    and Liberal politicians have failed women, as well as tossing bouquets\n\
    at the few men &ndash; Victorian QC Chris Maxwell comes in for special mention\n\
    &ndash; who use their power and influence to pursue justice for women. Given\n\
    that she was amongst the band of optimistic second-wave feminists who\n\
    confidently predicted that the mere presence of more women in Canberra\n\
    would make a difference, I particularly admired her willingness to\n\
    express disappointment in the 60 female members and senators who now\n\
    comprise over a quarter of pollies on the Federal benches for failing to\n\
    agitate on behalf of women. Emily\xE2\x80\x99s List (the Labour women\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    organization that funds progressive female candidates) rightly comes in\n\
    for particular scrutiny for its inability &ndash; despite requiring all the\n\
    candidates it funds to demonstrate that they are pro-choice and\n\
    pro-childcare &ndash; to \xE2\x80\x9Cgalvanise\xE2\x80\x9D women to act on these commitments once\n\
    elected.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Throughout the book, Summers reveals herself to be a woman who doesn\xE2\x80\x99t\n\
    just get mad, but gets active. She writes unselfconsciously (as if\n\
    everyone leaps into constructive action when their fundamental values\n\
    are challenged) about her outrage at Prime Minister Howard\xE2\x80\x99s failure to\n\
    appoint a female Governor General, and his subsequent leaking to the\n\
    media that he desired to do so (leaving the clear impression that there\n\
    wasn\xE2\x80\x99t a single woman in the country who was qualified). Grabbing a copy\n\
    of Who\xE2\x80\x99s Who, it took Summers less than an hour to come up with 45 names\n\
    of women who were more than qualified for the post.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I must admit to being somewhat disappointed by the analysis Summers\n\
    provides of the causes of &ndash; and cures for &ndash; the work/family crunch and\n\
    resultant \xE2\x80\x9Cfertility strike.\xE2\x80\x9D Unlike her discussion of violence and the\n\
    subterranean but highly politically sophisticated way in which the\n\
    Howard government has \xE2\x80\x9Cdisappeared\xE2\x80\x9D women from the political agenda &ndash;\n\
    where she clearly knows her way well around the factual and conceptual\n\
    terrain &ndash; she consistently fails to call on the intellectual apparatus\n\
    needed to make sense of the varied and complex things women want, do and\n\
    settle for when it comes to work and family. There is no doubt this\n\
    areas is complicated, with seeming contradictions at every turn. What to\n\
    make, for instance, of repeated surveys that show that young Australian\n\
    women are as committed as young men to the paid workforce (to remaining\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cattached\xE2\x80\x9D to it and progressing up the career ladder), but others that\n\
    reveal substantial numbers of women claiming to \xE2\x80\x9Cchoose\xE2\x80\x9D total\n\
    withdrawal from the paid workforce or insecure part-time non-career\n\
    related jobs when they become mothers? \xE2\x80\x9CConstrained choice\xE2\x80\x9D and the\n\
    meaning of being a \xE2\x80\x9Cnon-chooser\xE2\x80\x9D in liberal democratic societies like\n\
    Australia are just some of the concepts found in thoughtful feminist\n\
    analysis of women\xE2\x80\x99s work/life decisions that would have assisted Summers\n\
    to both explain such trends, and point the way ahead.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But if you\xE2\x80\x99ve got a pulse and care about justice for women, you\xE2\x80\x99re sure\n\
    to finish the book itching to do something &ndash; anything &ndash; to catapult\n\
    women\xE2\x80\x99s quest for equality back on to the national agenda. Wisely,\n\
    Summers is prepared, dedicating her final chapter to a list of \xE2\x80\x9Cten ways\n\
    to change the world\xE2\x80\x9D and a directory of the relevant organizations and\n\
    individuals to contact to make your displeasure known. Since going to\n\
    press, she has even put this information up on her new website\n\

    make, for instance, of repeated surveys that show that young Australian\r\n\
    women are as committed as young men to the paid workforce (to remaining\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cattached\xE2\x80\x9D to it and progressing up the career ladder), but others that\r\n\
    reveal substantial numbers of women claiming to \xE2\x80\x9Cchoose\xE2\x80\x9D total\r\n\
    withdrawal from the paid workforce or insecure part-time non-career\r\n\
    related jobs when they become mothers? \xE2\x80\x9CConstrained choice\xE2\x80\x9D and the\r\n\
    meaning of being a \xE2\x80\x9Cnon-chooser\xE2\x80\x9D in liberal democratic societies like\r\n\
    Australia are just some of the concepts found in thoughtful feminist\r\n\
    analysis of women\xE2\x80\x99s work/life decisions that would have assisted Summers\r\n\
    to both explain such trends, and point the way ahead.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But if you\xE2\x80\x99ve got a pulse and care about justice for women, you\xE2\x80\x99re sure\r\n\
    to finish the book itching to do something - anything - to catapult\r\n\
    women\xE2\x80\x99s quest for equality back on to the national agenda. Wisely,\r\n\
    Summers is prepared, dedicating her final chapter to a list of \xE2\x80\x9Cten ways\r\n\
    to change the world\xE2\x80\x9D and a directory of the relevant organizations and\r\n\
    individuals to contact to make your displeasure known. Since going to\r\n\
    press, she has even put this information up on her new website\r\n\
    (annesummers.com.au) where - with the aid of hyperlinks - it is even\r\n\
    easier to get started.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t get mad,\xE2\x80\x9D Summers advises, \xE2\x80\x9Cget justice.\xE2\x80\x9D The rest she knows, is\r\n\
    up to us."

  content_markup: "<p>The budget will encourage single working women to have children &ndash; but\n\
    more needs to be done</p>\n\n\
    <p>Has the budget left the single and childless out in the cold? Speaking\n\
    on our ABC this morning, Peter Costello said, \xE2\x80\x9Cno.\xE2\x80\x9D According to the\n\
    treasurer, the fact that most childless singles will one day form\n\
    families means they will &ndash; and know they will &ndash; eventually be the\n\
    beneficiaries of handouts to new mothers and couples with kids.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Costello is right, and his claim points to an important and often\n\
    ignored cause of Australia\xE2\x80\x99s plummeting fertility rate. According to my\n\
    research, one of the reasons some women hesitate about having children\n\
    is that they notice the tough time contemporary mothers are having\n\
    balancing work and family, and don\xE2\x80\x99t want to share their pain. To\n\
    continue to behave as though government policy and workplace practices\n\
    only affect today\xE2\x80\x99s parents, instead of the potential parents of\n\
    tomorrow, is both naive and dangerous.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Here\xE2\x80\x99s how it works. A single women works alongside a number of women\n\
    with children, some single mums, others married with partners. Or she\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    got sisters, cousins or friends who have kids. During lunchbreaks, on\n\
    the phone, at family events, over dinner, these mothers tell their tales\n\
    of trying &ndash; and in modern-day Australia &ndash; failing to achieve their\n\
    desire to be good parents in happy marriages and, at the same time,\n\
    remain valued employees. Childless women listen to complaints mothers\n\
    make about the costs of childcare, and their worries about its impact on\n\
    their kids. They hear about the arguments mothers have with their blokes\n\
    over who does the drop-offs, washes the clothes, feeds the dog and takes\n\
    the day off when the child is sick. They guiltily observe, as childless\n\
    commentator Sian Prior admitted, mothers being \xE2\x80\x9Cpunished for not staying\n\
    back late in the office\xE2\x80\x9D and are aware that their own career advancement\n\
    comes at the expense of these \xE2\x80\x9Cexhausted but determined\xE2\x80\x9D women.\n\
    Childless women hear and watch all this and they think: I want to\n\
    mother, but not like this. And they delay a little longer.</p>\n\n\

  content: "The budget will encourage single working women to have children - but\r\n\
    more needs to be done\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Has the budget left the single and childless out in the cold? Speaking\r\n\
    on our ABC this morning, Peter Costello said, \xE2\x80\x9Cno.\xE2\x80\x9D According to the\r\n\
    treasurer, the fact that most childless singles will one day form\r\n\
    families means they will - and know they will - eventually be the\r\n\
    beneficiaries of handouts to new mothers and couples with kids.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Costello is right, and his claim points to an important and often\r\n\
    ignored cause of Australia\xE2\x80\x99s plummeting fertility rate. According to my\r\n\
    research, one of the reasons some women hesitate about having children\r\n\
    is that they notice the tough time contemporary mothers are having\r\n\
    balancing work and family, and don\xE2\x80\x99t want to share their pain. To\r\n\
    continue to behave as though government policy and workplace practices\r\n\
    only affect today\xE2\x80\x99s parents, instead of the potential parents of\r\n\
    tomorrow, is both naive and dangerous.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Here\xE2\x80\x99s how it works. A single women works alongside a number of women\r\n\
    with children, some single mums, others married with partners. Or she\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    got sisters, cousins or friends who have kids. During lunchbreaks, on\r\n\
    the phone, at family events, over dinner, these mothers tell their tales\r\n\
    of trying - and in modern-day Australia - failing to achieve their\r\n\
    desire to be good parents in happy marriages and, at the same time,\r\n\
    remain valued employees. Childless women listen to complaints mothers\r\n\
    make about the costs of childcare, and their worries about its impact on\r\n\
    their kids. They hear about the arguments mothers have with their blokes\r\n\
    over who does the drop-offs, washes the clothes, feeds the dog and takes\r\n\
    the day off when the child is sick. They guiltily observe, as childless\r\n\
    commentator Sian Prior admitted, mothers being \xE2\x80\x9Cpunished for not staying\r\n\
    back late in the office\xE2\x80\x9D and are aware that their own career advancement\r\n\
    comes at the expense of these \xE2\x80\x9Cexhausted but determined\xE2\x80\x9D women.\r\n\
    Childless women hear and watch all this and they think: I want to\r\n\
    mother, but not like this. And they delay a little longer.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Childless men are also paying attention to what\xE2\x80\x99s going on around them.\r\n\
    Despite the hype, growing numbers of them are committed, when they\r\n\
    finally do become fathers, to being \xE2\x80\x9Caccessible\xE2\x80\x9D and intimately involved\r\n\

    (and in some industries 60) hour weeks miss out on promotion and pay\r\n\
    rises, they know these ambitions have little chance of being fulfilled.\r\n\
    So they too delay.\r\n\

  content_markup: "<p>British filmmaker Julia\xE2\x80\x99s Black\xE2\x80\x99s documentary My Foetus won\xE2\x80\x99t screen in\n\
    Australia until August 8, but debate has already begun about whether the\n\
    film should be censored, and the impact it will have on political debate\n\
    about abortion.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The film, made while Black was pregnant with her first child,\n\
    reconsiders an abortion she had over a decade earlier. It shows a\n\
    four-week pregnant woman having a suction termination, as well as foetal\n\
    remains at 10, 11 and 21 weeks gestation. The filmmaker claims, in an\n\
    article in The Observer, to present both sides of the \xE2\x80\x9Creality\xE2\x80\x9D of\n\
    abortion: balancing what she describes as \xE2\x80\x9Cshocking, repulsive, and\n\
    confrontational\xE2\x80\x9D images of aborted foetuses with the circumstances and\n\
    emotions of the unhappily pregnant women forced to choose.</p>\n\n\
    <p>There is no question in my mind that My Foetus should be screened. For\n\
    one, it is an unprecedented opportunity for the public to see\n\
    foetal-remains accompanied by accurate captions and commentary. For too\n\
    long, the anti-choice movement has mislabelled images of older fetuses\n\
    as those of 14 weeks gestational age or younger (not coincidentally, the\n\
    period when approximately 95 per cent of abortions take place). For too\n\
    long, the anti-choice movement has used voice-overs in propaganda films\n\
    such as The Silent Scream (in which the ultrasonographic images used are\n\
    so fuzzy and unclear as to be unrecognisable without narrative\n\
    direction) to imply women who abort are heartless and cruel.</p>\n\n\
    <p>More importantly, pro-choice advocates have long seen the foetus as the\n\
    property of the other side: accepting anti-choice claims that if the\n\
    fetus is admitted to be both human and alive, abortion must be\n\
    acknowledged as morally wrong and made illegal &ndash; again.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Yet, as fetal imagery becomes increasingly ubiquitous (who amongst us\n\
    hasn\xE2\x80\x99t seen an ultrasound image or an anti-choice billboard?), this\n\
    position has become increasingly politically risky. Black is right to\n\
    feel that the pro-choice movement must reclaim the foetus, though I\n\
    disagree with her assertion that the reason the movement has shied away\n\
    in the past is the \xE2\x80\x9Crepulsiveness\xE2\x80\x9D of foetal remains.</p>\n\n\
    <p>No, the real problem with focusing on the fetus is that it leaves women\n\
    &ndash; literally &ndash; out of the picture. A typical fetal image is of a\n\
    balled-up cosmonaut in a circular, disembodied capsule. It is rare for\n\
    the line surrounding the fetus to even gesture at its reality as a\n\
    woman\xE2\x80\x99s womb, or to the geographical relationship of the capsule to the\n\
    rest of the woman\xE2\x80\x99s body (is she sitting or standing? In which direction\n\
    are her feet and face?)</p>\n\n\
    <p>More importantly than her body, a focus on the fetus leaves the woman\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    life out of the picture: her partnership status; her ability to parent\n\
    well; her plans and ambitions for the future. Yet it precisely this\n\
    context, and the way the woman approaches and makes her decision, that\n\
    makes her choice comprehensible, and provides its moral texture and\n\
    meaning.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The anti-choice movement knows this. That is why the \xE2\x80\x9Chard cases\xE2\x80\x9D &ndash;\n\
    unwanted pregnancies resulting from incest and rape, or those that\n\
    threaten a woman\xE2\x80\x99s life &ndash; split the movement in two. Because while such\n\
    foetuses are as alive and human as any other, most refuse to condemn\n\
    women who abort in such circumstances. Better than any other, these\n\
    cases show it is our judgements about women\xE2\x80\x99s motives and intentions\n\
    that determine our moral evaluation of her particular abortion. And\n\
    experience shows such judgements to be harsher for strangers, and kinder\n\
    for friends. Abortion clinic staff repeatedly report doing terminations\n\

    picket lines again.</p>\n\n\
    <p>As Black\xE2\x80\x99s film testifies, feeling bad about abortion (or, more\n\
    precisely, feeling bad about finding oneself in the position of having\n\
    to face the decision at all) is testament that our moral sensibilities\n\
    are finely tuned, not that abortion is wrong. Most people who choose\n\
    divorce, particularly those with children, feel less than exultant about\n\
    having to make that decision; yet few believe this proves the choice was\n\
    wrong, or should be legally denied.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Black rarely spoke of her long-ago abortion. Few of the one in three\n\
    women who will have an abortion in their lifetime do. She says she wants\n\
    her film to change that, and the laws that in both the UK and many\n\
    states in Australia that hand doctors ultimate control over whether a\n\
    woman can get an abortion; requiring women \xE2\x80\x9Cto plead insanity to end an\n\
    unwanted pregnancy.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>The truth is no one knows what the reaction of the Australian public\n\
    will be to the film. But there is no reason why, if Black has done her\n\
    work well &ndash; ensuring both women and foetuses remain in the frame &ndash; than\n\
    supporters of abortion rights have anything to fear. It is a anti-choice\n\
    myth that women don\xE2\x80\x99t really know what they are doing when they\n\
    terminate, and that seeing foetal remains will reveal some previously\n\
    unrealised \xE2\x80\x9Ctruth\xE2\x80\x9D about the procedure.</p>\n\n\

    and impressive resume. The author of seventeen books, including the\n\
    bestselling Goodbye Jerusalem, Goodbye Babylon and First Abolish the\n\

    including The Notradamus Kid and Bastards from the Bush. He\xE2\x80\x99s won or\n\

    Award.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Ellis is also a Labour speechwriter and quintessential leftie insider.\n\
    These days he works for Bob Carr, gets medical referrals from SA Premier\n\
    Mike Rann, and dines with Natasha (\xE2\x80\x9CTash\xE2\x80\x9D) Stott-Despoja and her\n\
    (extravagantly wanting, to Ellis\xE2\x80\x99s mind) fianc\xC3\xA9, Ian. He has regular\n\

    lips\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cdreamy girlish beauty\xE2\x80\x9D (Maxine McKew and Stott-Despoja). In\n\
    return, they praise him for getting things \xE2\x80\x9Cas usual, dead right\xE2\x80\x9D (Susie\n\
    Annus), for being \xE2\x80\x9Cold-fashioned, but in a very, very nice way\xE2\x80\x9D (fellow\n\
    speechwriter Carol Green) and by laughing hysterically at his political\n\
    wit (Carr).</p>\n\n\
    <p>Some may find such windows into the personal relationships, intimate\n\
    thoughts and general comings and goings of contemporary power-brokers\n\
    offers welcome relief from the recycled press releases and 20-second\n\
    grabs that now substitutes for current affairs reporting in this\n\
    country. Others may see it as nothing more than name-dropping from an\n\
    aging man preoccupied with his own death and anxious about his own place\n\
    &ndash; and the place of the ideas he\xE2\x80\x99s championed all his life &ndash; in history.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Make no mistake about it, Ellis is a good guy. He feels for the needy\n\
    and is contemptuous of the greedy, and never fails to use his influence\n\
    to ease the suffering of the most forgotten and abused in Australian\n\
    society. He gave hospitality to Ali Bakhtiyari, the man whose sons fled\n\
    from detention but were refused refuge at the UK Consulate, and vainly\n\
    worked his contacts to prevent the children being shipped back to\n\
    Woomera.</p>\n\n\
    <p>There is also evidence, on numerous occasions, of a fine turn of phrase.\n\
    I love Ellis\xE2\x80\x99s description of taking his two dogs \xE2\x80\x9Cfor a whiffle on the\n\
    beach among the seaweed and the gulls and a town meeting of other\n\
    yelping dogs near the big tree\xE2\x80\x9D. With a few deft phrases, his\n\
    description of witnessing an IRA bombing in London back in the 1970s,\n\
    puts us right there.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Yet death confronts us on every page. Ellis admires his mother\xE2\x80\x99s fight\n\
    against her \xE2\x80\x9Cfinal descent\xE2\x80\x9D and rages against the dying of his own\n\
    personal light. He repeatedly laments the under-appreciation of the\n\
    contributions to politics and culture of dead white men he knew\n\
    personally or admired from history (does he fear a similar fate?), and\n\
    the denial of legitimacy to the varied excuses such men had for failing\n\
    to live up to expectations (as he fears he has?).</p>\n\n\
    <p>For those disinterested in this theme, the text offers little refuge.\n\
    While those who already share Ellis\xE2\x80\x99s world view may take comfort in his\n\
    passionate rehearsal of various left-wing lines (he\xE2\x80\x99s anti-Iraq war,\n\
    anti-Israel, anti-Bush, and pro asylum-seekers), those needing sustained\n\
    and logical argument to be persuaded of the wisdom of Ellis\xE2\x80\x99s assertions\n\
    will be disappointed. His attitude seems to be that you\xE2\x80\x99re either with\n\
    him or a\xE2\x80\x99gin him: if it\xE2\x80\x99s the former you need no persuasion, while those\n\
    in the latter camp will never be convinced, anyway. As a consequence,\n\
    what\xE2\x80\x99s on offer is never weightier than a moment-by-moment recounting of\n\
    recent events surrounding the war in Iraq, accompanied by Ellis\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    evaluation of whether any particular political action or attempt at spin\n\

    Perpetual Peace): volumes that purport to offer a comprehensive analysis\n\
    of a recent event by \xE2\x80\x9Ca great thinker of our time\xE2\x80\x9D. If journalism is the\n\

    necessarily characteristic of writing forced to conform to the 24-hour\n\
    news cycle, yet starved of both distance from the event and the\n\
    perspective offered by time, their significance can be doubted. While\n\

    \r\n\
    TEASE: Most people are familiar with at least some of Bob Ellis\xE2\x80\x99s long\r\n\
    and impressive resume. The author of seventeen books, including the\r\n\
    bestselling Goodbye Jerusalem, Goodbye Babylon and First Abolish the\r\n\
    Customer, he\xE2\x80\x99s also written and directed features and documentaries\r\n\
    including The Notradamus Kid and Bastards from the Bush. He\xE2\x80\x99s won or\r\n\
    been nominated for numerous honours, including the Premier\xE2\x80\x99s Literary\r\n\
    Award.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Ellis is also a Labour speechwriter and quintessential leftie insider.\r\n\
    These days he works for Bob Carr, gets medical referrals from SA Premier\r\n\
    Mike Rann, and dines with Natasha (\xE2\x80\x9CTash\xE2\x80\x9D) Stott-Despoja and her\r\n\
    (extravagantly wanting, to Ellis\xE2\x80\x99s mind) fianc\xC3\xA9, Ian. He has regular\r\n\
    encounters with political big-wigs who impress him with their, \xE2\x80\x9Creason\r\n\
    and skill\xE2\x80\x9D (Kevin Rudd), the \xE2\x80\x9Csedate\xE2\x80\x9D manner in which they move\r\n\

  title: Why are Young Women Welcoming the Return of the Bunny?

  content_markup: "<p>The Playboy symbol is enjoying a resurgence in popularity. What does\n\
    this signify?</p>\n\n\
    <p>It\xE2\x80\x99s everywhere. In the smartest shops in Acland Street, and featuring\n\
    in trendy Chapel Street in Prahran. On natty little terry short and the\n\
    smart canvas gym-bag purses that are the currently the pinnacle of\n\
    street-wear chic. The Playboy Bunny logo is back. The question is: what\n\
    does its return mean?</p>\n\n\
    <p>I\xE2\x80\x99m going to nail my colours to the mast here. When I see that Bunny,\n\
    the image that comes to mind are of tall, large-breasted women with\n\
    strap-on fur tails tottering somewhat unsteadily on spike-heels; their\n\
    painted red lips stretched into a fake-looking smile as a diminutive,\n\
    bathrobe-wearing Hugh Hefner snakes his wizened, overly tan arms around\n\
    their waists.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Bunny logo also makes me think of Gloria Steinem, who was young and\n\
    pretty enough to go undercover as a Bunny Cocktail waitress at the\n\
    Playboy Club in New York City. Though I wasn\xE2\x80\x99t even born when her expose\n\
    of the degrading and oppressive conditions women endured working in this\n\
    supposedly glamorous job appeared in Esquire in 1963, I was impressed\n\
    with her insights &ndash; published years later in a collection of essays &ndash;\n\
    into the cost of Bunnyhood not just to the minority of women who don\n\
    overlarge pink ears or pose for centrefolds, but to all women who live\n\
    in societies where Bunnyhood is seen as a suitable career aspiration for\n\
    young girls of talent.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This is what the Bunny logo means to me, and perhaps to other\n\
    feminist-minded women and men of my, and more mature, vintages. And this\n\
    is why I won\xE2\x80\x99t buy anything that carries it. But Bunny-stamped items are\n\
    selling well particularly &ndash; according to my local shop girl &ndash; to women\n\
    in their teens and early twenties. The question is: why?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Perhaps the reason is simple, and actually suggests something quite\n\
    positive. The traditional Playboy model is far more rounded and\n\
    healthy-looking than the under-fed, under-slept female form idealised in\n\
    so many women\xE2\x80\x99s magazines. Maybe in wearing the Bunny symbol, what young\n\
    women are saying is that they are proud of their womanly curves, and\n\
    prefer them to looking like a heroin-addicted stick.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Another positive take on the Bunny\xE2\x80\x99s return is that in donning this\n\
    long-standing symbol of female oppression, women are reclaiming it as a\n\
    sign of empowerment. In the same way that Gays reclaimed as a symbol of\n\
    unity and pride the pink triangle that the Nazis used to brand and\n\
    oppress them, young Bunny-wearing women are boldly proclaiming their\n\
    faith in a world where Girl Power reigns and feminism &ndash; simply because\n\
    it is no longer needed &ndash; is a thing of the past. In such a world girls\n\
    can freely embrace both their femininity and sexuality without fear of &ndash;\n\
    as one Girl-Power scholar puts it &ndash; its \xE2\x80\x9Cusual worrisome baggage.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>A less optimistic interpretation, however, is that women\xE2\x80\x99s embrace of\n\
    the Bunny reflects their sense of disillusionment with &ndash; rather than\n\
    empowerment within &ndash; the post-industrial world in which they are coming\n\
    of age. Maybe, more than we realise, young women are tuning in when we\n\
    older ones complain of unequal wages, sexual harassment,\n\
    family-unfriendly policies and impenetrable glass ceilings at the\n\
    workplace. Perhaps they observe when those zealously guarding the reigns\n\
    of power either ridicule our distress, or ignore it. For such young\n\
    women, the Playboy symbol may hold out the time-honoured promise that if\n\
    they\xE2\x80\x99re pretty, \xE2\x80\x9Cput out\xE2\x80\x9D and otherwise play their cards right, there is\n\
    a way for them to make it to the top of the status and income pile: on\n\
    the arm of a wealthy and powerful man.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So which interpretation is the correct one? The evidence, in my view, is\n\
    in favour of the Bunny as a symbol of Girl Power. Sure, there are\n\
    differences in the way the Gay Pride movement reclaimed the pink\n\
    triangle and the reappearance of the Bunny logo. The former was a\n\
    self-consciously political act by a grass-roots activist movement, while\n\
    the latter is nothing more than a marketing experiment. Nevertheless,\n\
    there are natty shorts with the Bunny on it and many more without &ndash;\n\
    ditto cute handbags &ndash; and significant numbers of young women are\n\
    choosing to buy the former. Given what we know about the optimism of\n\
    youth in general, and the disinterest of so many young women in a\n\
    feminism they see as irrelevant to their lives, there is good reason to\n\
    believe that in embracing the Bunny, young women see themselves as\n\
    reclaiming male-centred ideas of femininity and female sexuality, and\n\
    making them their own.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It\xE2\x80\x99s hard not to admire them. Certainly, you can\xE2\x80\x99t blame them. Given the\n\
    choice of viewing the future in such a promising light or as hedged and\n\
    barricaded by entrenched, often subterranean but always fiercely\n\
    defended power and privilege, who wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t choose the former? And isn\xE2\x80\x99t\n\
    the belief that such a world can exist, indeed does exist, a necessary\n\
    prerequisite for actually bringing it about? \xE2\x80\x9CYou go girls,\xE2\x80\x9D I want to\n\
    cheer. And so I will.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I just hope they\xE2\x80\x99re right.</p>\n"

    reclaiming male-centred ideas of femininity and female sexuality, and\r\n\
    making them their own.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It\xE2\x80\x99s hard not to admire them. Certainly, you can\xE2\x80\x99t blame them. Given the\r\n\
    choice of viewing the future in such a promising light or as hedged and\r\n\
    barricaded by entrenched, often subterranean but always fiercely\r\n\
    defended power and privilege, who wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t choose the former? And isn\xE2\x80\x99t\r\n\
    the belief that such a world can exist, indeed does exist, a necessary\r\n\
    prerequisite for actually bringing it about? \xE2\x80\x9CYou go girls,\xE2\x80\x9D I want to\r\n\
    cheer. And so I will.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I just hope they\xE2\x80\x99re right."

    long-running debate about Australia\xE2\x80\x99s fertility debate, someone had to\n\
    point out that baby-making and baby-raising is not a solitary business.\n\
    This means that it simply doesn\xE2\x80\x99t make sense to keep pointing the finger\n\
    of blame for Australia\xE2\x80\x99s low birth rate at women alone.</p>\n\n\

    freedom to mother and how they can get it back\xE2\x80\x9D (extracted in Good\n\
    Weekend 22/1), there is little question that men\xE2\x80\x99s desire and decisions\n\
    impact significantly on whether women who desire children actually wind\n\
    up mothers. The truth is men can derail women\xE2\x80\x99s maternity plans by\n\
    failing to partner, failing to prove themselves good father material or\n\
    simply refusing to have the kids that they promised their spouse years\n\
    earlier they would want \xE2\x80\x9Cone day\xE2\x80\x9D. Such problems, among others, are why\n\
    it just doesn\xE2\x80\x99t make sense to leave men out of discussions about the\n\
    whys and wherefores of Australia\xE2\x80\x99s low birthrates.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But I know there are Australian men who have the incomes and credentials\n\
    to be part of the problem, but have chosen instead to be part of the\n\
    solution. That single men exist who are willing to commit to women they\n\
    love within a reasonable time frame or when an unplanned pregnancy\n\
    intrudes on well-laid plans. Men who, the moment they realise they are\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cjust not that into\xE2\x80\x9D the maternity-yearning woman beside them, let her\n\
    know so she can find someone who is. I realise that the nation has\n\
    plenty of men willing to put aside their own anxieties about career and\n\
    money &ndash; and ignore the fact that physiologically they still have time &ndash;\n\
    so they can say \xE2\x80\x9Cyes\xE2\x80\x9D to partners who want to get pregnant while they\n\
    are still young.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I call such blokes \xE2\x80\x9Cthe gorgeous men\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In fact, not only have men been wrongly excluded from discussions about\n\
    Australia\xE2\x80\x99s low fertility, but notions of \xE2\x80\x9Cchoice\xE2\x80\x9D have been promulgated\n\
    that palpably lack the sophistication to accurately describe what women\n\
    do when they decide against kids. To put it simply, women don\xE2\x80\x99t always\n\
    do what they choose to do. In particular, my research makes clear that\n\
    while the vast majority of women want to mother, their freedom to choose\n\
    children at any particular point is shaped and limited by a range of\n\
    social circumstances and attitudes.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It would be both unfair and illogical of me to claim that while women\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    decisions about children are constrained by social attitudes and\n\
    structures, men behave as they do because they are naturally rotten to\n\
    the core. Instead, I have sought to examine not just what men do when it\n\
    comes to partnering and parenthood, but what they want to do and would,\n\
    if they were really free to choose.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Not surprisingly, there are plenty of reasons for male hesitation when\n\
    it comes to partnering and parenthood. Foremost among them is the desire\n\
    of men to fulfil their obligations to their partners and kids without\n\
    committing career hari-kari.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Sadly, research suggests that the handful of men who really do swear off\n\
    breakfast meeting, leave at 5:00 to pick up at creche and refuse to work\n\
    weekends find themselves in the same career cul de sac as working\n\
    mothers. Indeed, Australian managers are good at making clear to men in\n\
    more ways then one that any worker who modifies his schedule to\n\
    accommodate new fatherhood will be struck off the A-list for the crime\n\
    of being inadequately \xE2\x80\x9Cserious\xE2\x80\x9D. For instance, one study found that just\n\
    8% of Australian manager believed fathers should be entitled to 52 weeks\n\
    unpaid leave after the birth of a baby, while a mere third supported a\n\
    five-day a year \xE2\x80\x9Cspecial family leave\xE2\x80\x9D entitlement.</p>\n\n\
    <p>What all this suggests is that most Australian workplaces remain hostile\n\
    to anyone who removes their nose from the grindstone, not to working\n\
    mothers per se. While social convention and pay inequality ensure that\n\
    it is largely women who will attempt to modify their work patterns to\n\
    achieve some semblance of balance between work and family &ndash; and wind up\n\
    on the Mummy Track for their troubles &ndash; working fathers who attempt a\n\
    similar juggling act will suffer the same career misfortune.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In the same way that women don\xE2\x80\x99t want to have to take it on the career\n\
    chin when they become a mother, many men are also reluctant to fulfil\n\
    their obligations to their partners, kids and &ndash; given the joy of\n\
    fatherhood &ndash; themselves at the cost of their satisfaction and\n\
    advancement at work. And why should either sex have to pay such a high\n\
    and enduring cost (in superannuation and lifelong earning capacity, to\n\
    name a few) for doing the right thing?</p>\n\n\
    <p>My answer is that they shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t. In the same way that women are\n\
    entitled to resent the high costs Australian society demands of those\n\
    who have children and to refuse to buy into manipulative claims that if\n\
    they really loved their children they wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t complain, men should also\n\
    resist any assertion that if they were really gorgeous men, they would\n\
    simply suck up whatever punishment the workplace doles out to active\n\
    dads, and talk about how they were never really all that\n\

    <p>Rather, both genders need to join hands and insist that enough is\n\
    enough. That\xE2\x80\x99s it\xE2\x80\x99s become too hard to have children in Australian\n\

    sex offenders such as Victoria\xE2\x80\x99s Mr Baldy, due for release from prison\n\
    in August.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Mr Baldy was locked up for serial crimes of kidnapping and shaving the\n\
    heads of young boys before assaulting them. Soon after his first release\n\
    from jail, he attacked a young child again.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I know it\xE2\x80\x99s the job of Liberty Victoria\xE2\x80\x99s vice-president, Jamie\n\
    Gardener, to condemn the intention of the Bracks Government to introduce\n\

    his job to say things such as: \xE2\x80\x9CLiberty views with grave concern any\n\
    adding-on of sentences to people who have served their time set down by\n\
    the courts, (because this) is not something that is consistent with\n\
    human rights.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>But what folks like Mr Gardener often seem to forget is that no civil\n\
    right, no matter how important, is absolute. The rights of repeat sex\n\
    offenders like Mr Baldy need to be balanced against those of the\n\
    children to be protected from being his next victim.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Otherwise, when absolute rights clash, impenetrable deadlock is the\n\
    result, and all chance of consensus are lost.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The question is, does the Bracks plan get that balance right? I think it\n\
    does.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Mr Gardener\xE2\x80\x99s worry seems to be that tagging offenders punishes them\n\
    twice ~~&ndash; first by incarceration, then by monitoring~~&ndash; for the same\n\
    crime.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But this is not a continuing worry. If the tagging legislation passes,\n\
    future sentences will include post-release surveillance rather than\n\
    adding it on at the end.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This means that this problem &ndash; technically termed \xE2\x80\x9Cdouble jeopardy\xE2\x80\x9D &ndash;\n\
    falls away.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The real infringement of electronic surveillance is on a prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    rights to privacy. WHETHER the data from their bracelet is downloaded\n\
    daily through the phone or transmitted in real time, those wearing\n\
    electronic tags will be living in the Panopticon &ndash; an architectural\n\
    figure envisioned by political philosopher Jeremy Bentham.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It has a central tower around which is built an annular structure\n\
    divided into cells that extend the entire width of the building to allow\n\
    both inner and outer windows.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The occupants of the cells are isolated from one another by walls, but\n\
    able to be observed collectively and individually by an unseen observer\n\
    in the tower.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The problem for the prisoners of the Panopticon is that they can be seen\n\
    &ndash; and know they can &ndash; but they are unable to see in return. They have no\n\
    idea of who is looking at them, when, and what &ndash; if anything &ndash; those\n\
    people plan to do with the knowledge they gain.0</p>\n\n\
    <p>Even if data on their movements is not to be used against them\n\
    (something that is not the case with the electronic tag, which will most\n\
    likely be used to ensure prisoners conform to whatever movement\n\
    restrictions the courts sets down as a condition of their release),\n\
    those in the Panopticon suffer a complete loss of privacy and the\n\
    dignity and personal power that comes with it.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But if the electronic tags actually stop paedophiles from re-offending,\n\
    then this loss must be weighed against the gain of increased community\n\
    safety.</p>\n\n\
    <p>According to Don Thomson, Professor of Forensic Psychology at Charles\n\
    Sturt University, we have reason to think that tagging will deter\n\
    offenders from committing further crimes against children. If the\n\
    prisoner knows an alarm will sound if he violates prescribed boundaries,\n\
    he\xE2\x80\x99s unlikely to do so on pain of either being caught in the act or, if\n\
    the violation is discovered only later, the certainty of being convicted\n\
    and locked away, perhaps for good.</p>\n\n\
    <p>And there is some evidence from a handful of studies that electronic\n\
    monitoring, if combined with effective therapy, does reduce rates of\n\
    reoffending.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But this is the rub.</p>\n\n\
    <p>While the government is effusive about the benefits of surveillance,\n\
    there\xE2\x80\x99s been no mention of increased funding for the evaluation and\n\
    provision of effective treatment for sex offenders. Yet is it critical\n\
    that such funding be provided, not only to ensure we get value from the\n\
    money spent on the bracelets, but because treatment is the best way to\n\
    make the community as safe as we can for children.</p>\n\n\
    <p>According to Professor Thomson, money is desperately needed to both\n\
    properly evaluate which treatments work and to provide them to convicts\n\
    inside and outside the prison walls (where the temptation of real\n\
    children running around provides the one true test of cure).</p>\n\n\
    <p>Until funds to do this work are found, we can\xE2\x80\x99t really look our children\n\
    in the eye and say we\xE2\x80\x99ve done all we can to make them safe.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Because the best way to avoid released prisoners re-offending is not to\n\
    track them, but to change them.</p>\n"

    This means that this problem - technically termed \xE2\x80\x9Cdouble jeopardy\xE2\x80\x9D -\r\n\
    falls away.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The real infringement of electronic surveillance is on a prisoner\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    rights to privacy. WHETHER the data from their bracelet is downloaded\r\n\
    daily through the phone or transmitted in real time, those wearing\r\n\
    electronic tags will be living in the Panopticon - an architectural\r\n\
    figure envisioned by political philosopher Jeremy Bentham.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It has a central tower around which is built an annular structure\r\n\
    divided into cells that extend the entire width of the building to allow\r\n\
    both inner and outer windows.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The occupants of the cells are isolated from one another by walls, but\r\n\
    able to be observed collectively and individually by an unseen observer\r\n\
    in the tower.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The problem for the prisoners of the Panopticon is that they can be seen\r\n\
    - and know they can - but they are unable to see in return. They have no\r\n\
    idea of who is looking at them, when, and what - if anything - those\r\n\
    people plan to do with the knowledge they gain.0\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Even if data on their movements is not to be used against them\r\n\
    (something that is not the case with the electronic tag, which will most\r\n\
    likely be used to ensure prisoners conform to whatever movement\r\n\
    restrictions the courts sets down as a condition of their release),\r\n\
    those in the Panopticon suffer a complete loss of privacy and the\r\n\
    dignity and personal power that comes with it.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But if the electronic tags actually stop paedophiles from re-offending,\r\n\
    then this loss must be weighed against the gain of increased community\r\n\
    safety.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    According to Don Thomson, Professor of Forensic Psychology at Charles\r\n\
    Sturt University, we have reason to think that tagging will deter\r\n\
    offenders from committing further crimes against children. If the\r\n\
    prisoner knows an alarm will sound if he violates prescribed boundaries,\r\n\
    he\xE2\x80\x99s unlikely to do so on pain of either being caught in the act or, if\r\n\
    the violation is discovered only later, the certainty of being convicted\r\n\
    and locked away, perhaps for good.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    And there is some evidence from a handful of studies that electronic\r\n\
    monitoring, if combined with effective therapy, does reduce rates of\r\n\
    reoffending.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But this is the rub.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    While the government is effusive about the benefits of surveillance,\r\n\
    there\xE2\x80\x99s been no mention of increased funding for the evaluation and\r\n\
    provision of effective treatment for sex offenders. Yet is it critical\r\n\
    that such funding be provided, not only to ensure we get value from the\r\n\
    money spent on the bracelets, but because treatment is the best way to\r\n\
    make the community as safe as we can for children.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    According to Professor Thomson, money is desperately needed to both\r\n\
    properly evaluate which treatments work and to provide them to convicts\r\n\
    inside and outside the prison walls (where the temptation of real\r\n\
    children running around provides the one true test of cure).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Until funds to do this work are found, we can\xE2\x80\x99t really look our children\r\n\
    in the eye and say we\xE2\x80\x99ve done all we can to make them safe.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Because the best way to avoid released prisoners re-offending is not to\r\n\
    track them, but to change them."

  title: Put an End to Abortion Whispers
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:47:59
  content_markup: "<p>As Prime Minister John Howard put it: \xE2\x80\x9CYou can\xE2\x80\x99t have a situation where\n\
    every time somebody dares to express a view, they\xE2\x80\x99re jumped upon from a\n\
    great height and it\xE2\x80\x99s said the issue is back on the agenda.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>He\xE2\x80\x99s right. The country needs to take a few deep breaths, and a long\n\
    view on abortion politics.</p>\n\n\
    <p>We all know there is a strident coterie of conservative, misogynist men\n\
    in the inner circle of Government who are not only completely opposed to\n\
    women having a right to choose abortion at any stage of pregnancy, but\n\
    determined to do something about it.</p>\n\n\
    <p>What this means is that over the next few years we are going to be\n\
    hearing a lot from this powerful posse about female irresponsibility\n\
    when it comes to contraception. We\xE2\x80\x99ll be getting an earful about callous\n\
    feminist career-women who selfishly choose abortion instead of\n\
    motherhood, or depressed and regretful \xE2\x80\x9Cpost-abortive\xE2\x80\x9D women who\n\
    demonstrate the folly of society trusting the female of the species to\n\
    make important decisions about their own futures, and they\xE2\x80\x99ll be heaps\n\
    about the number of abortions that Australian women have. They\xE2\x80\x99ll be\n\
    more assertions than you can shake a stick at about the tragedy of\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Clate-term\xE2\x80\x9D abortions (a term that will never be defined but will be\n\
    applied to all terminations done after 12 or 14 weeks) and our ears will\n\
    be bashed with graphic descriptions of termination techniques used after\n\
    the first trimester.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It will be implied that abortion causes breast cancer despite the US\n\
    National Cancer Institute stating unequivocally in 2003 (based on a meta\n\
    analysis of all existing population-based, clinical and animal studies)\n\
    that \xE2\x80\x9Chaving an abortion or miscarriage does not increase a woman\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    subsequent risk of developing breast cancer\xE2\x80\x9D. It will be asserted that\n\
    abortion causes post-traumatic stress, despite Ronald Regan\xE2\x80\x99s Surgeon\n\
    General, the anti-choice C. Everett Koop, concluding that psychological\n\
    problems from abortion were \xE2\x80\x9Cminuscule from a public health\n\
    perspective\xE2\x80\x9D, and a panel of the American Psychological Foundation\n\
    concluding in 1989 that terminating an unwanted pregnancy posed no\n\
    hazard to women\xE2\x80\x99s mental health.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Questions will be raised about the safety of Mifepristone (RU 486), a\n\
    drug unavailable in Australia as a result of past anti-choice activism\n\
    despite it being used safely for many years by millions of women in at\n\
    least 19 countries. Assertions will be made about the unfairness of\n\
    making anti-choice taxpayers subsidize women\xE2\x80\x99s abortions through\n\
    Medicare (though the entitlement of bike-riders to withdraw their taxes\n\
    from the building of roads, will not be mentioned).</p>\n\n\
    <p>My point is twofold. First, we\xE2\x80\x99ve got a long, long way to go until the\n\
    next federal election. From this point until at least then &ndash; and maybe\n\
    longer, given current predictions about time needed for Labour to become\n\
    competitive again &ndash; we can feel confident that anti-choice Coalition\n\
    forces are going to use their power and influence in any way they can to\n\
    stir the pot on the abortion issue.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Are we going to jump every time any one of them says, \xE2\x80\x9Cboo\xE2\x80\x9D? Dance like\n\
    marionettes whenever they tug (the same old) string? How many times can\n\
    and should we \xE2\x80\x9Cdebate\xE2\x80\x9D the same issues, particularly when &ndash; despite all\n\
    the argy-bargy at the tail end of last year &ndash; a national public opinion\n\
    survey done by the ANU showed 81% of Australians agreeing that women\n\
    should have a right to choose?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Which brings me to my second point. Putting a question on notice (as\n\
    Boswell has done) is not \xE2\x80\x9Creigniting the debate.\xE2\x80\x9D Politicians repeating\n\
    their well-known personal views on the issue (as Beazley has done) is\n\
    not \xE2\x80\x9Cre-igniting the debate\xE2\x80\x9D. In fact, these contributions &ndash; such as\n\
    they are &ndash; are barely newsworthy. If I may quote dictionary.com, a\n\
    debate is a \xE2\x80\x9Cdiscussion involving opposing points\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But what is the \xE2\x80\x9Cpoint\xE2\x80\x9D of Boswell asking for precise numbers of\n\
    terminations, given he\xE2\x80\x99s among the crowd that thinks even one is too\n\
    many. Isn\xE2\x80\x99t it a foregone conclusion he\xE2\x80\x99ll conclude, no matter what\n\
    figure he gets, that it\xE2\x80\x99s too high? Thanks to the prolonged discussion\n\
    last year on the topic, we know what anti-choice MPs think about\n\
    abortion: they don\xE2\x80\x99t like them, or approve of the women who have them.\n\
    What we don\xE2\x80\x99t know is what the legislative intent is of the MPs who keep\n\
    doing whatever it takes to return abortion to the news. As co-conveners\n\
    of Emily\xE2\x80\x99s List Joan Kirner and Claire Moore put it yesterday, a public\n\
    debate on this issue run by politicians without any declared legislative\n\
    change is \xE2\x80\x9Cat best unnecessary and at worst misleading.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>What are anti-choice MPs plotting to do to women\xE2\x80\x99s freedom to get an\n\
    abortion? How are their secret plans going to affect the freedom of\n\
    Australian women and couples to decide for themselves if and when\n\
    they\xE2\x80\x99ll have children?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Such revelations would not only be newsworthy, they would provide the\n\
    information for a real debate, and a fair political battle, to begin.\n\
    Once the doors of all those prayer sessions and secret meetings are\n\
    flung open, Australian women and families will finally know &ndash; instead of\n\
    having to guess &ndash; precisely how their reproductive freedoms are going to\n\
    come under attack in the next few years. Experts will be able to\n\
    evaluate and make comment on how women and couples, from city and bush\n\
    and those of greater and lesser means, would be affected by mooted\n\
    administrative changes and legislative proposals. The media could ask\n\
    politicians to state their voting intentions, and Australian women and\n\
    couples would finally know how they, and those they love, are likely to\n\
    be affected by the changes proposed.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So let\xE2\x80\x99s stop the pseudo-debate, and let the real one begin.</p>\n"

  title: "Book Review - Motherguilt: Australian women reveal their true feelings about motherhood"
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:47:49
  content_markup: "<p>Ita Buttrose &amp; Dr Penny Adams. Penguin/Viking, $32.95</p>\n\n\
    <p>TEASE: Motherguilt bills itself as a book in which Australian women\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Crevel their true feelings about motherhood\xE2\x80\x9D and one that assists women\n\
    to \xE2\x80\x9Cdeprogram themselves\xE2\x80\x9D from the powerful and unique \xE2\x80\x9Cepidemic of\n\
    guilt\xE2\x80\x9D experienced by today\xE2\x80\x99s mothers.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The strength of the book is the myriad of women\xE2\x80\x99s voices found on each\n\
    page. Both celebrity and \xE2\x80\x9Cordinary\xE2\x80\x9D mothers confess their parental sins\n\
    and doubts, and express their views on a wide range of maternal\n\
    experiences (mothering the \xE2\x80\x9Cnot-so-perfect\xE2\x80\x9D child, the experience of\n\
    breastfeeding, maternal competitiveness in the playgroup).</p>\n\n\
    <p>It\xE2\x80\x99s not easy for women to admit they\xE2\x80\x99ve found mothering unbearably\n\
    boring, or that they\xE2\x80\x99ve sometimes put their child\xE2\x80\x99s need second to their\n\
    own, when such admissions can lead them to be labelled a \xE2\x80\x9Cbad\xE2\x80\x9D mother.\n\
    Yet, 69-year old Jean risks this by sharing her disappointment with her\n\
    early mothering experience. \xE2\x80\x9CI can remember thinking,\xE2\x80\x9D, she recounts,\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98If this is my life, my God, I\xE2\x80\x99d rather be dead\xE2\x80\x99.\xE2\x80\x9D Journalist Adele\n\
    Horin take us into her confidence with her tale of sending a sick child\n\
    to school so she could get to work, while presenter Joanna Griggs\n\
    confesses that she has the \xE2\x80\x9Ctime of her life\xE2\x80\x9D when away from her\n\
    children covering sport for Channel 7. As the authors rightly note,\n\
    women\xE2\x80\x99s sharing of their maternal battle stories \xE2\x80\x9Chas a curative power\n\
    all of its own\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Sadly, the rest of Motherguilt seems dedicated to wounding, rather than\n\
    healing. Instead of alleviating women\xE2\x80\x99s guilt feelings about motherhood,\n\
    it appears dedicated to affirming their current levels of moral angst,\n\
    or even making them worse. For example, the authors assert without a\n\
    shred of research evidence that contemporary mothers use abortion as\n\
    contraception, see babies as \xE2\x80\x9Cfashion accessories\xE2\x80\x9D and, in failing to be\n\
    relaxed and happy mothers, deny their children the carefree childhood\n\
    that is their \xE2\x80\x9Cinalienable right\xE2\x80\x9D. Stay-at-home mothers are castigated\n\
    for giving up their professional careers and allowing their kids\xE2\x80\x99 school\n\
    lives to take on exaggerated importance, as well as providing a poor\n\
    role model to their children by helping them cheat on homework\n\
    assignments.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But it is working mothers who really need to duck for cover. According\n\
    to the authors, their reliance on prepared and fast foods coupled with\n\
    their failure to serve up a family meal every night is the cause of\n\
    increased rates of childhood obesity; their busy lives and\n\
    competitiveness causes stressed, depressed and ADHD kids who miss out on\n\
    time to \xE2\x80\x9Cgaze at the clouds drifting by, watch a butterfly flit around\n\
    the garden or throw pebbles in a pond\xE2\x80\x9D; while their lack of time to\n\
    listen to their teenagers increases adolescent drinking and anorexia.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Similarly alarming \xE2\x80\x9Cfacts\xE2\x80\x9D and accusations appear throughout the book,\n\

    \r\n\
    TEASE: Motherguilt bills itself as a book in which Australian women\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Crevel their true feelings about motherhood\xE2\x80\x9D and one that assists women\r\n\
    to \xE2\x80\x9Cdeprogram themselves\xE2\x80\x9D from the powerful and unique \xE2\x80\x9Cepidemic of\r\n\
    guilt\xE2\x80\x9D experienced by today\xE2\x80\x99s mothers.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The strength of the book is the myriad of women\xE2\x80\x99s voices found on each\r\n\
    page. Both celebrity and \xE2\x80\x9Cordinary\xE2\x80\x9D mothers confess their parental sins\r\n\
    and doubts, and express their views on a wide range of maternal\r\n\
    experiences (mothering the \xE2\x80\x9Cnot-so-perfect\xE2\x80\x9D child, the experience of\r\n\
    breastfeeding, maternal competitiveness in the playgroup).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It\xE2\x80\x99s not easy for women to admit they\xE2\x80\x99ve found mothering unbearably\r\n\
    boring, or that they\xE2\x80\x99ve sometimes put their child\xE2\x80\x99s need second to their\r\n\
    own, when such admissions can lead them to be labelled a \xE2\x80\x9Cbad\xE2\x80\x9D mother.\r\n\
    Yet, 69-year old Jean risks this by sharing her disappointment with her\r\n\
    early mothering experience. \xE2\x80\x9CI can remember thinking,\xE2\x80\x9D, she recounts,\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x98If this is my life, my God, I\xE2\x80\x99d rather be dead\xE2\x80\x99.\xE2\x80\x9D Journalist Adele\r\n\
    Horin take us into her confidence with her tale of sending a sick child\r\n\
    to school so she could get to work, while presenter Joanna Griggs\r\n\
    confesses that she has the \xE2\x80\x9Ctime of her life\xE2\x80\x9D when away from her\r\n\
    children covering sport for Channel 7. As the authors rightly note,\r\n\
    women\xE2\x80\x99s sharing of their maternal battle stories \xE2\x80\x9Chas a curative power\r\n\
    all of its own\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Sadly, the rest of Motherguilt seems dedicated to wounding, rather than\r\n\
    healing. Instead of alleviating women\xE2\x80\x99s guilt feelings about motherhood,\r\n\
    it appears dedicated to affirming their current levels of moral angst,\r\n\
    or even making them worse. For example, the authors assert without a\r\n\
    shred of research evidence that contemporary mothers use abortion as\r\n\
    contraception, see babies as \xE2\x80\x9Cfashion accessories\xE2\x80\x9D and, in failing to be\r\n\
    relaxed and happy mothers, deny their children the carefree childhood\r\n\
    that is their \xE2\x80\x9Cinalienable right\xE2\x80\x9D. Stay-at-home mothers are castigated\r\n\
    for giving up their professional careers and allowing their kids\xE2\x80\x99 school\r\n\
    lives to take on exaggerated importance, as well as providing a poor\r\n\
    role model to their children by helping them cheat on homework\r\n\
    assignments.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But it is working mothers who really need to duck for cover. According\r\n\
    to the authors, their reliance on prepared and fast foods coupled with\r\n\
    their failure to serve up a family meal every night is the cause of\r\n\
    increased rates of childhood obesity; their busy lives and\r\n\
    competitiveness causes stressed, depressed and ADHD kids who miss out on\r\n\
    time to \xE2\x80\x9Cgaze at the clouds drifting by, watch a butterfly flit around\r\n\
    the garden or throw pebbles in a pond\xE2\x80\x9D; while their lack of time to\r\n\
    listen to their teenagers increases adolescent drinking and anorexia.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Similarly alarming \xE2\x80\x9Cfacts\xE2\x80\x9D and accusations appear throughout the book,\r\n\
    though they must always be taken on faith as no sources - either in the\r\n\
    text or in notes - are provided.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But most disturbing are the authors\xE2\x80\x99 conclusions about the causative\r\n\
    role contemporary mothers are playing in the downfall of the nation\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    children. This is Ita:\r\n\

    <p>But while has been his claims about female biology that have caused him\n\
    so much grief, it was the Harvard President\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Chigh-powered job\xE2\x80\x9D thesis\n\

    <p>Essentially, it re-badges institutional gender inequity as the morally\n\

    \xE2\x80\x9Credefining success\xE2\x80\x9D &ndash; rather than bashing their heads against iron\n\
    ceilings &ndash; is extremely popular at the moment. A 2003 cover story in the\n\
    New York Times Magazine put the case this way. Beneath a photo of a\n\
    mother and baby cuddling at the foot of a ladder, it asked \xE2\x80\x9CWhy don\xE2\x80\x99t\n\
    more women get to the top?\xE2\x80\x9D. The answer: \xE2\x80\x9CThey choose not to.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Convenient? I\xE2\x80\x99ll say. But the trouble is that there\xE2\x80\x99s no evidence that\n\
    when mothers have real choice, they dump their plans to have the same\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Call\xE2\x80\x9D as men have always enjoyed and sedately file home. Instead, what\n\

    <p>Here\xE2\x80\x99s just some of what a 2004 US Government Accountability Office\n\

    tenure track position. Thirdly, they complained that because they\n\
    shoulder the bulk of the second shift at home but their male colleagues\n\

    an extra year after a baby is born to publish before a tenure decision\n\

    <p>The message from Health Minister Tony Abbott remains unequivocal:\n\
    Kathleen Donnelly, the mother of his wrongly assumed son, Daniel\n\
    O\xE2\x80\x99Connor, is a \xE2\x80\x9Cnice\xE2\x80\x9D girl.</p>\n\n\
    <p>As the latest twist in the ongoing adoption reunion story broke on\n\
    Monday night, Abbott made his continuing fondness for his old girlfriend\n\
    clear, despite his newfound awareness that she was sexually involved\n\
    with other men during the years he believed they were having an\n\
    exclusive affair.</p>\n\n\
    <p>While reporters repeatedly invited him to dump on Donnelly, Abbott\n\
    refused to pass judgement about what he described as \xE2\x80\x9Chot-blooded young\n\

    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CWe were all pretty wild back then so I am not in the business of making\n\

    that\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Indeed, in his interviews with the press last month, Abbott has\n\
    suggested that his \xE2\x80\x9Ccallow\xE2\x80\x9D decision to go overseas during Donnelly\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    pregnancy must also be understood in the context of his youthful\n\
    immaturity. Presumably, a similar explanation accounts for the couple\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    failure to use contraception throughout their years of intimate\n\
    involvement.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Such sentiments should be music to the ears of the vast majority of\n\
    Australians who support a woman\xE2\x80\x99s right to choose. They imply that\n\
    having recently tried to give parents access to their teenager\xE2\x80\x99s medical\n\
    records in order to stop their \xE2\x80\x9Copen-slather sexual activity\xE2\x80\x9D, and to\n\
    restrict the access of women and couples to safe and affordable\n\
    abortion, Tony Abbott has seen the error of his ways.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Having refused to judge or condemn Donnelly for past mistakes, or\n\
    behaviour inconsistent with his moral values, is Abbott finally prepared\n\
    to recognise the arrogance of his past judgement of other woman and\n\
    couples who &ndash; like he and Donnelly &ndash; had sex and unintentionally wound\n\
    up pregnant? To realise that like he and Donnelly, we are all nice\n\
    people doing our best to live what we see as moral lives but at times\n\
    get waylaid by cloudy judgement, immaturity or sheer bad luck? That\n\
    everyone deserves to have their behaviour and decisions interpreted in\n\
    the context of their limits, and the framework of their lives?</p>\n\n\
    <p>If Donnelly can violate Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s code of sexual morality but still be\n\
    judged a nice girl, then why not the rest of us? If the definition of a\n\
    nice girl (and boy, for that matter) is a person who does their best to\n\
    live well in a complex world where things don\xE2\x80\x99t always go to plan, don\xE2\x80\x99t\n\
    we all qualify?</p>\n\n\
    <p>What remains unclear is whether Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s complex personal situation will\n\
    lead him to question his rigid and long-held views of female sexuality\n\
    and reproductive obligation. Remember, he comes from a family that\n\
    Donnelly says froze her out the moment they discovered she was pregnant.\n\
    Will Tony Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s intimate engagement with the real world, with all its\n\
    shades of grey, collapse the nice girl/slut distinction that has driven\n\
    his agenda on sexuality and reproduction for so long?</p>\n\n\
    <p>According to psychologist Dr Susie Allanson, a counsellor of 15 years at\n\
    the East Melbourne Fertility Control Clinic, the odds are regrettably\n\
    slim. Over the years Allanson has counselled a number of women who are\n\
    not just morally opposed to abortion but have actively campaigned\n\
    against it being safe and legal. Yet, when they have found themselves\n\
    unhappily pregnant, they decide in favour of abortion.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The problem, says Allanson, is that while such women sympathise with\n\
    their own situation and feel confident their case justifies an abortion,\n\
    most refuse to allow their experience translate to compassion for other\n\
    women facing the same dilemma. Instead, these women prefer to see their\n\
    experience as unique and so no challenge to their abortion politics or\n\
    their uncompromising judgement of all aborting women &ndash; except\n\
    themselves, of course &ndash; as murderers.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Hypocrisy? You bet. And the worry is that Abbott will fall victim to\n\
    this most universally despised moral failing, too. That instead of\n\
    recognising that the personal limits and situational complexity\n\
    characterising his case precisely mirror the dilemmas others face on the\n\
    sexual, contraceptive and unplanned pregnancy front, that he\xE2\x80\x99ll insist\n\
    on seeing them as one-off and one-of-a-kind. That rather than preserve\n\
    the freedom he and Kathleen had to make their own decisions &ndash; even\n\
    mistakes &ndash; and to take responsibility for them, he\xE2\x80\x99ll continue to do all\n\
    in his power to deny those caught in a similar bind the freedom to\n\

    <p>No Jules didn\xE2\x80\x99t feel it. Perhaps that was where her ease, her lightness,\n\

    the queenly and caring Robert. Having abandoned the noisy landmark\n\
    Fitzroy street cafe Marios as a suitable site for the initial meet and\n\
    greet, she and Jules set the rendezvous at a pub across the street from\n\

    Vandeleur paints a picture of the quintessential modern woman facing the\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CWhat, no baby?\xE2\x80\x9D problem. The problem faced by too many educated,\n\

    neither does she intend to be \xE2\x80\x9Ccaught\xE2\x80\x9D in any old relationship simply\n\
    because she knows her time is running out. Her self-esteem so\n\
    fundamental to who she is as to need no remark, Letty understands &ndash; and\n\
    proceeds on the principle &ndash; that she is better off parenting a donor-bub\n\
    alone then partnered to a man who doesn\xE2\x80\x99t attract her physically and\n\
    emotionally (her pet hate is scuffed shoes with a business suit). It\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    hard not to like Letty as she doggedly pursues her maternal dreams\n\
    through \xE2\x80\x9CWeekly Weighers\xE2\x80\x9D and several failed pregnancy attempts without\n\
    losing her sense of humour, proportion, or compassion for the various\n\
    trials of her gang of colourful friends.</p>\n\n\

    start-up business, Letty seems to demonstrate the truth of recent\n\
    research findings that while women still want me, they don\xE2\x80\x99t need them.\n\
    And it is the gap between what women desire, and men are willing or able\n\

    alone then partnered to a man who doesn\xE2\x80\x99t attract her physically and\r\n\
    emotionally (her pet hate is scuffed shoes with a business suit). It\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    hard not to like Letty as she doggedly pursues her maternal dreams\r\n\
    through \xE2\x80\x9CWeekly Weighers\xE2\x80\x9D and several failed pregnancy attempts without\r\n\
    losing her sense of humour, proportion, or compassion for the various\r\n\
    trials of her gang of colourful friends.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Her emotional needs met by her friends, her financial by her own\r\n\
    start-up business, Letty seems to demonstrate the truth of recent\r\n\
    research findings that while women still want me, they don\xE2\x80\x99t need them.\r\n\
    And it is the gap between what women desire, and men are willing or able\r\n\
    to produce - at least for those in the current \xE2\x80\x9Ctransitional\xE2\x80\x9D generation\r\n\
    like Letty - that is causing all the angst."

  content_markup: "<p>The Moral of the Story: An anthology of ethics through literature edited\n\
    by Peter Singer and Renata Singer RRP: $49.95\\\n\
    TEASE: Over my (far too) many years of studentship and academic\n\
    employment, I have bought (far too) many books, (far too) many of which\n\
    have stagnated on my shelves, growing dusty and churlish from disuse.\n\
    Amongst this unedifying lot have never been tomes edited or authored by\n\
    Peter Singer. This is not because it is impossible to disagree with\n\
    Singer, or to occasionally find his fearless exploration of the most\n\
    complex, sensitive and interesting ethical issues of our times\n\
    unsatisfying terse and one-dimensional. But rather because with the\n\
    exception of de Botton, Singer is without peer when it comes to picking\n\
    the right topic and penning erudite and accessible prose steeped in\n\
    casual references to philosophical debates on similar issues dating back\n\
    thousands of years. In The Moral of the Story, written in partnership\n\
    with wife Renata, he does it again, compiling an anthology that\n\
    students, academic philosophers and writers interested in ethics (and\n\
    what writer isn\xE2\x80\x99t) will pull off the shelf to thumb through again and\n\
    again.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Singers describe themselves as editors of The Moral of the Story but\n\
    they are much more. Clearly dedicated readers of quality fiction, they\n\
    do a superlative job at what I\xE2\x80\x99m sure was the humbling task of selecting\n\
    &ndash; then editing for purpose and sense &ndash; the back-list of western\n\
    civilisation. Having been refused permission by a number of authors,\n\
    including American Psycho author Bret Easton Ellis, to anthologise their\n\
    work in the collection, they ultimately settle on 79 excerpts by 61\n\
    authors. These include pieces from Genesis, Sophocles, Shelly, Ibsen,\n\
    Dickens, Arna Bontemps, James Baldwin, S. Yizhar, Ursula Le Guin, Joyce\n\
    Carol Oates, Kathy Lette and the comic writer Douglas Adams.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I was familiar with about one quarter of the material, though\n\
    interestingly I found this neither diminished (through repetition) or\n\
    enhanced (because of my stored bank of additional knowledge of character\n\
    and plot) my enjoyment of the material. Instead, the pruning of each\n\
    selection and its filing under a particular section heading (as a story\n\
    exploring \xE2\x80\x9CDuties to God\xE2\x80\x9D or the moral issues that arise around paid\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CWork\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9CWar\xE2\x80\x9D) refocused my attention on a previously unconsidered\n\
    aspect of a particular tale, giving the story &ndash; no matter how familiar &ndash;\n\
    new life.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But the real value-add comes in the Preface to collection, and the\n\
    Singers\xE2\x80\x99 introduction to each of the book\xE2\x80\x99s 15 sections. Here they set\n\
    the ethical scene, introducing the issues in play &ndash; and the conflict of\n\
    values that typically arise &ndash; when considering, say, \xE2\x80\x9CDuties to Kin\xE2\x80\x9D,\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CNew Life Forms\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9CAnimals and the Environment\xE2\x80\x9D. As well, those\n\
    interested in using the book\xE2\x80\x99s fictional excerpts as a teaching aid will\n\
    find a range of issues and pertinent questions arising from each\n\
    selection compiled at the back.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Some of these introductions are done extremely well. I was particularly\n\
    impressed with the one on \xE2\x80\x9CLove, marriage and sex\xE2\x80\x9D, in which the authors\n\
    observe that while the decision of whether and who to marry will \xE2\x80\x9Chave\n\
    more impact on our lives than most other decision we make\xE2\x80\x9D, there has\n\
    been \xE2\x80\x9Crelatively little serious discussion about the values underlying\n\
    the choice of mate\xE2\x80\x9D. They then briefly explore the various literary\n\
    models of the ideal romantic relationship: Shakespeare\xE2\x80\x99s depiction of\n\
    sudden passionate love in Romeo and Juliet; de Maupassant\xE2\x80\x99s contention\n\
    in The Model that lasting love requires a \xE2\x80\x9Cdeeper union of the minds\xE2\x80\x9D;\n\
    Seth\xE2\x80\x99s suggestion, made through Lata\xE2\x80\x99s ultimate choice of Haresh for her\n\
    husband in A Suitable Boy, that arranged marriages based upon common\n\
    values provides the firmest foundation for mature love to eventually\n\
    flourish.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Unfortunately, other such preemptory remarks are less consistent with\n\
    the spirit of inquiry, rather than argument, that rightly characterises\n\
    an exploration of ethics through literature. Indeed, what the authors\n\
    seem to miss in their early discussion of the key differences in the way\n\
    literature and philosophy approach ethics is the ultimately different\n\
    aims of each for doing so. The aim of philosophical argument is to prove\n\
    the rightness of one\xE2\x80\x99s own claims, in part, by exposing the flaws in our\n\
    opponents\xE2\x80\x99 arguments. In contrast, the best books and plays resist the\n\
    temptation to argue conclusively for a particular point of view.\n\
    Instead, they seek to deepen our emotional understanding of the\n\
    complexity and profundity of particular value conflicts by putting the\n\
    sharpest most persuasive arguments in the mouths of the characters on\n\
    both side of the case. This not only sharpens the value conflict and\n\
    consequently the drama, but grants legitimacy to the existence of the\n\
    conflict in the first place.</p>\n\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CThere\xE2\x80\x99s no need to fight about these things,\xE2\x80\x9D says the philosopher.\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CThis argument proves conclusively that the others are wrong and I am\n\
    right.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9COf course we must fight about these things,\xE2\x80\x9D counters the writer. \xE2\x80\x9CWho\n\
    but God could witness such a contest and have any idea who is right?\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>To avoid the emotional retreat and defensiveness that many have to\n\
    philosophical preaching, novelists draw us into a conflict by\n\
    emphasising its acuity, and the lack of certainty even very good people\n\
    can feel about the right thing to do. Ironically, this suggests that the\n\
    road to a deep and full understanding of the nature and meaning of a\n\
    moral dilemma also leads to moral relativism.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Now there\xE2\x80\x99s a conundrum on which I would have like to have heard the\n\
    Singers pronounce.</p>\n"

    \xE2\x80\x9CNew Life Forms\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9CAnimals and the Environment\xE2\x80\x9D. As well, those\r\n\
    interested in using the book\xE2\x80\x99s fictional excerpts as a teaching aid will\r\n\
    find a range of issues and pertinent questions arising from each\r\n\
    selection compiled at the back.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Some of these introductions are done extremely well. I was particularly\r\n\
    impressed with the one on \xE2\x80\x9CLove, marriage and sex\xE2\x80\x9D, in which the authors\r\n\
    observe that while the decision of whether and who to marry will \xE2\x80\x9Chave\r\n\
    more impact on our lives than most other decision we make\xE2\x80\x9D, there has\r\n\
    been \xE2\x80\x9Crelatively little serious discussion about the values underlying\r\n\
    the choice of mate\xE2\x80\x9D. They then briefly explore the various literary\r\n\
    models of the ideal romantic relationship: Shakespeare\xE2\x80\x99s depiction of\r\n\
    sudden passionate love in Romeo and Juliet; de Maupassant\xE2\x80\x99s contention\r\n\
    in The Model that lasting love requires a \xE2\x80\x9Cdeeper union of the minds\xE2\x80\x9D;\r\n\
    Seth\xE2\x80\x99s suggestion, made through Lata\xE2\x80\x99s ultimate choice of Haresh for her\r\n\
    husband in A Suitable Boy, that arranged marriages based upon common\r\n\
    values provides the firmest foundation for mature love to eventually\r\n\
    flourish.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Unfortunately, other such preemptory remarks are less consistent with\r\n\
    the spirit of inquiry, rather than argument, that rightly characterises\r\n\
    an exploration of ethics through literature. Indeed, what the authors\r\n\
    seem to miss in their early discussion of the key differences in the way\r\n\
    literature and philosophy approach ethics is the ultimately different\r\n\
    aims of each for doing so. The aim of philosophical argument is to prove\r\n\
    the rightness of one\xE2\x80\x99s own claims, in part, by exposing the flaws in our\r\n\
    opponents\xE2\x80\x99 arguments. In contrast, the best books and plays resist the\r\n\
    temptation to argue conclusively for a particular point of view.\r\n\
    Instead, they seek to deepen our emotional understanding of the\r\n\
    complexity and profundity of particular value conflicts by putting the\r\n\
    sharpest most persuasive arguments in the mouths of the characters on\r\n\
    both side of the case. This not only sharpens the value conflict and\r\n\
    consequently the drama, but grants legitimacy to the existence of the\r\n\
    conflict in the first place.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CThere\xE2\x80\x99s no need to fight about these things,\xE2\x80\x9D says the philosopher.\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CThis argument proves conclusively that the others are wrong and I am\r\n\
    right.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9COf course we must fight about these things,\xE2\x80\x9D counters the writer. \xE2\x80\x9CWho\r\n\
    but God could witness such a contest and have any idea who is right?\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    To avoid the emotional retreat and defensiveness that many have to\r\n\
    philosophical preaching, novelists draw us into a conflict by\r\n\
    emphasising its acuity, and the lack of certainty even very good people\r\n\
    can feel about the right thing to do. Ironically, this suggests that the\r\n\
    road to a deep and full understanding of the nature and meaning of a\r\n\
    moral dilemma also leads to moral relativism.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Now there\xE2\x80\x99s a conundrum on which I would have like to have heard the\r\n\
    Singers pronounce."

    pay for equal work, more funding for women\xE2\x80\x99s diseases like breast\n\

    <p>Yet despite the difficulties women and the women\xE2\x80\x99s movement have talking\n\
    about motherhood &ndash; or more precisely the nature of the conflict mothers\n\
    experience between work and family and how it should be resolved &ndash; it\n\
    remains an issue of major issue concern for contemporary women. Not just\n\
    women who already have children, but the 92% of young women who want to\n\
    have them, as well as a steady partner and career, in the future.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Feminists have been the ones who have identified women\xE2\x80\x99s unhappiness\n\
    about work/family imbalance and the main ones to suggest solutions to\n\
    the problem, yet the women\xE2\x80\x99s movement is unlikely to ever muster the\n\
    political muscle to compel change. This is because the transformations\n\
    required &ndash; no less than the structural reorganisation of paid employment\n\
    and an increasingly globalised economy &ndash; are too major, and the forces\n\
    arrayed against such change too powerful.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Yet change will come. Indeed, profound changes in the size and makeup of\n\
    Australia\xE2\x80\x99s population that are already underway make it inevitable.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Australian women now have on average only 1.73 children each, a\n\
    fertility rate far below the 2.1 children per woman needed for steady\n\
    population growth. And according to the ABS, the rapid dive of our\n\
    fertility rate is set to continue. On one estimate, it will fall to 1.3\n\
    by 2008. During this time, our already rapidly aging population will\n\
    continue to age. Indeed, by 2051 the ABS predicts there will be three\n\
    times as many Australians aged 65 to 84, and half the number of\n\
    children, than was the case in 1971.</p>\n\n\
    <p>What this means is that as the children of the largest generation we\xE2\x80\x99ve\n\
    had in quite some time, the Baby-Boomers, make their way from their\n\
    current starting positions in the labour force to the positions of power\n\
    their parents and those from Generation X now occupy, there will be\n\
    increasingly smaller pools of applicants from which to select their\n\
    replacements. Sure, business will do as it currently does today, compete\n\
    like mad for skilled migrants to make up the difference, but given the\n\
    low fertility scenario is happening across the western world, Australian\n\
    business is unlikely to be successful enough to significantly relieve\n\
    the skilled labour shortage.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This is when things will get interesting. Because &ndash; unlike today &ndash;\n\
    employers will no longer have the luxury to say, favour a childless\n\
    applicant or a man with a full-time wife at home over a working mother\n\
    to fill a given vacancy, the current practice of marginalizing workers &ndash;\n\
    mostly mothers &ndash; who can\xE2\x80\x99t arrive at 7:00 in the morning and put in\n\
    face-time until 8:00 at night will end. As is always the case when\n\
    labour is short, workers will have far more control than they do\n\
    currently over their conditions of employment.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Some will no doubt make the trade that global capitalism favours:\n\
    exchanging increased productivity (read: more time every week at work)\n\
    for higher wages. But I suspect many more will bargain for what is\n\
    already and will continue to be the scarcest commodity in contemporary\n\
    life &ndash; time. Along with their secure career-track jobs, these workers\n\
    will demand capped time, fractional time, flexible time, work-at-home\n\
    time and time to go visit their kids on the days the other parent &ndash;\n\
    demanding the same conditions &ndash; is not at home with them at the\n\
    subsidised work-place based cr&egrave;che. And it won\xE2\x80\x99t just be working\n\
    mothers demanding such conditions, it will be dads, too. Because if\n\
    there is one way in which feminism has changed the world, it is in\n\
    changing men\xE2\x80\x99s beliefs not only about women\xE2\x80\x99s right to paid employment,\n\
    but their own responsibility to share in the work of running a household\n\
    and raising the kids.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Empty nesters wanting time to help care for their grandkids, childless\n\
    workers wishing to donate quality time to a cherished social cause or\n\
    hobby, the unemployed. All these groups, as well as parents, will\n\
    benefit from the long overdue reversal of global capitalism\xE2\x80\x99s relentless\n\
    push towards the \xE2\x80\x9Cdownsizing\xE2\x80\x9D that means little more in their day-to-day\n\
    lives than more time at the office doing two jobs instead of one. In the\n\
    new world, it is more likely that two jobs will be shared between two\n\
    and one half people, or even three.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Rapidly declining fertility rates not only indicate the unhappiness of\n\
    contemporary women and men with work/family imbalance, it points to the\n\
    way the problem will be solved.</p>\n\n\
    <p>And I for one, can\xE2\x80\x99t wait.</p>\n"

    What this means is that as the children of the largest generation we\xE2\x80\x99ve\r\n\
    had in quite some time, the Baby-Boomers, make their way from their\r\n\
    current starting positions in the labour force to the positions of power\r\n\
    their parents and those from Generation X now occupy, there will be\r\n\
    increasingly smaller pools of applicants from which to select their\r\n\
    replacements. Sure, business will do as it currently does today, compete\r\n\
    like mad for skilled migrants to make up the difference, but given the\r\n\
    low fertility scenario is happening across the western world, Australian\r\n\
    business is unlikely to be successful enough to significantly relieve\r\n\
    the skilled labour shortage.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This is when things will get interesting. Because - unlike today -\r\n\
    employers will no longer have the luxury to say, favour a childless\r\n\
    applicant or a man with a full-time wife at home over a working mother\r\n\
    to fill a given vacancy, the current practice of marginalizing workers -\r\n\
    mostly mothers - who can\xE2\x80\x99t arrive at 7:00 in the morning and put in\r\n\
    face-time until 8:00 at night will end. As is always the case when\r\n\
    labour is short, workers will have far more control than they do\r\n\
    currently over their conditions of employment.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Some will no doubt make the trade that global capitalism favours:\r\n\
    exchanging increased productivity (read: more time every week at work)\r\n\
    for higher wages. But I suspect many more will bargain for what is\r\n\
    already and will continue to be the scarcest commodity in contemporary\r\n\
    life - time. Along with their secure career-track jobs, these workers\r\n\
    will demand capped time, fractional time, flexible time, work-at-home\r\n\
    time and time to go visit their kids on the days the other parent -\r\n\
    demanding the same conditions - is not at home with them at the\r\n\
    subsidised work-place based cr&egrave;che. And it won\xE2\x80\x99t just be working\r\n\
    mothers demanding such conditions, it will be dads, too. Because if\r\n\
    there is one way in which feminism has changed the world, it is in\r\n\
    changing men\xE2\x80\x99s beliefs not only about women\xE2\x80\x99s right to paid employment,\r\n\
    but their own responsibility to share in the work of running a household\r\n\
    and raising the kids.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Empty nesters wanting time to help care for their grandkids, childless\r\n\
    workers wishing to donate quality time to a cherished social cause or\r\n\
    hobby, the unemployed. All these groups, as well as parents, will\r\n\
    benefit from the long overdue reversal of global capitalism\xE2\x80\x99s relentless\r\n\
    push towards the \xE2\x80\x9Cdownsizing\xE2\x80\x9D that means little more in their day-to-day\r\n\
    lives than more time at the office doing two jobs instead of one. In the\r\n\
    new world, it is more likely that two jobs will be shared between two\r\n\
    and one half people, or even three.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Rapidly declining fertility rates not only indicate the unhappiness of\r\n\
    contemporary women and men with work/family imbalance, it points to the\r\n\
    way the problem will be solved.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    And I for one, can\xE2\x80\x99t wait."

    <p>It\xE2\x80\x99s hard to read Virginia Haussegger, or to listen to her on radio &ndash; as\n\
    she has been in the last week, plugging Wonder Woman &ndash; and not find\n\
    yourself liking her. In particular, I admire her honesty. Since 2002,\n\
    when she threw open the doors on her reproductive journey and its\n\
    unwanted destination, Haussegger has never been anything less than\n\
    forthright about the pain she feels over finding herself unintentionally\n\
    childless.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Haussegger\xE2\x80\x99s ongoing personal journey both structures and animates\n\
    Wonder Woman. In it, Haussegger tries to make sense of the \xE2\x80\x9Ccreeping\n\
    non-choices\xE2\x80\x9D that led to the moment in the doctor\xE2\x80\x99s surgery where she\n\
    was briskly told she\xE2\x80\x99d left her run to motherhood too late. The book\n\
    also represents the author\xE2\x80\x99s working through of her grief about missing\n\
    out on motherhood, and her efforts to reconstruct a new imagined future,\n\
    and identity, for herself as a woman without children.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Haussegger writes movingly of the events leading up to the opinion piece\n\
    that shook the world (then-Opinion editor Paul Austin nominated it as\n\
    the piece published in recent years that generated the most response),\n\
    and about the distress that can be found in unexpected places when\n\
    life-long habits, like the carting of carefully labelled boxes full of\n\
    journals and photos from city to city, are recognised as having been\n\
    geared towards children who aren\xE2\x80\x99t to be. Writes Haussegger:</p>\n\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CWhen I was very young I was entranced by the few old photos we had of\n\
    my mother and father when they were young\xE2\x80\xA6I desperately wanted to know\n\
    what my mother was like when she was little\xE2\x80\xA6The fading photos gave some\n\
    clues, as did the precious jewellery box my mother kept hidden\n\
    away\xE2\x80\xA6Every piece held a story, every story I would demand to hear over\n\
    and over again\xE2\x80\xA6Now at forty years old, I\xE2\x80\x99ve built up a box of treasures\n\
    of my own. I just don\xE2\x80\x99t know who to show them to\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I cried at this line, which comes near the book\xE2\x80\x99s end. The cleanness of\n\
    the emotion a welcome relief from the turbulent confusion engendered by\n\
    the preceding (and subsequent, as it turned out) text. Because while\n\
    Haussegger it a wonderful raconteur, and demonstrates a clear gift for\n\
    exploring emotions &ndash; her own and, through interview, those of others &ndash;\n\
    she desperately lacks any capacity to think her way out of the complex\n\
    problems she explores in Wonder Woman. Despite having read most seminal\n\
    and popular feminist texts &ndash; from the Second Sex to the Female Eunich to\n\
    Backlash &ndash; she clearly failed to absorb their central and most important\n\
    message: that the personal is political. And without this understanding,\n\
    or some structural framework to make sense of her experience and those\n\
    of other women in terms other than those proffered by liberal\n\
    individualism, Haussegger lacks the tools to extricate herself from the\n\
    circular path of self-blame and DIY solutions that have characterised\n\
    her journey, and to cut a clear path forward for her female readers.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This is not to say that she does not, on rare occasions, allude to such\n\
    politics and their potential for women\xE2\x80\x99s liberation. Having begun the\n\
    book with her familiar refrain that it\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Chigh time to re-think\n\
    feminism\xE2\x80\x99s messages and the `have it all\xE2\x80\x99 mantra that\xE2\x80\x99s been thumped\n\
    into the brains and parlance of post-feminist women\xE2\x80\x9D, Haussegger then\n\
    tentatively contradicts the implications of this claim &ndash; that feminism\n\
    needs a less ambitious message &ndash; with a one-line assertion that\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cencourag[ing] young women to lessen their expectations, rather than\n\
    raise them by demanding more equity and support, is doomed\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But this theme quickly drops away, only to be briefly and somewhat\n\
    incoherently resurrected in the book\xE2\x80\x99s last few pages (I\xE2\x80\x99m afraid I have\n\
    no idea what the approvingly quoted Nicola Roxon means when she asserts\n\
    that contemporary feminists must fight \xE2\x80\x9Cto be ourselves\xE2\x80\x9D).</p>\n\n\
    <p>And so we are left with the bizarre hypothesis that the real problem\n\
    facing contemporary women is that feminists didn\xE2\x80\x99t tell them they\n\
    couldn\xE2\x80\x99t have it all, rather than the fact that even in post-feminist\n\
    times, they still can\xE2\x80\x99t.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The job of articulating this obvious truth was left to Shadow Health\n\
    Minister Julia Gillard who launched the book at the National Press Club\n\
    early this month. Gillard spoke eloquently of the need to move \xE2\x80\x9Cbeyond\n\
    the lament\xE2\x80\x9D and to \xE2\x80\x9Cgo forward, to carve out more change and to do what\n\
    we need to do now so [that the life of girls] is more full of real\n\
    choice than that of today\xE2\x80\x99s woman.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>You said it, sister. The question is: why didn\xE2\x80\x99t Haussegger?</p>\n"

    \r\n\
    I cried at this line, which comes near the book\xE2\x80\x99s end. The cleanness of\r\n\
    the emotion a welcome relief from the turbulent confusion engendered by\r\n\
    the preceding (and subsequent, as it turned out) text. Because while\r\n\
    Haussegger it a wonderful raconteur, and demonstrates a clear gift for\r\n\
    exploring emotions - her own and, through interview, those of others -\r\n\
    she desperately lacks any capacity to think her way out of the complex\r\n\
    problems she explores in Wonder Woman. Despite having read most seminal\r\n\
    and popular feminist texts - from the Second Sex to the Female Eunich to\r\n\
    Backlash - she clearly failed to absorb their central and most important\r\n\
    message: that the personal is political. And without this understanding,\r\n\
    or some structural framework to make sense of her experience and those\r\n\
    of other women in terms other than those proffered by liberal\r\n\
    individualism, Haussegger lacks the tools to extricate herself from the\r\n\
    circular path of self-blame and DIY solutions that have characterised\r\n\
    her journey, and to cut a clear path forward for her female readers.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This is not to say that she does not, on rare occasions, allude to such\r\n\
    politics and their potential for women\xE2\x80\x99s liberation. Having begun the\r\n\
    book with her familiar refrain that it\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Chigh time to re-think\r\n\
    feminism\xE2\x80\x99s messages and the \\`have it all\xE2\x80\x99 mantra that\xE2\x80\x99s been thumped\r\n\
    into the brains and parlance of post-feminist women\xE2\x80\x9D, Haussegger then\r\n\
    tentatively contradicts the implications of this claim - that feminism\r\n\
    needs a less ambitious message - with a one-line assertion that\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cencourag[ing] young women to lessen their expectations, rather than\r\n\
    raise them by demanding more equity and support, is doomed\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But this theme quickly drops away, only to be briefly and somewhat\r\n\
    incoherently resurrected in the book\xE2\x80\x99s last few pages (I\xE2\x80\x99m afraid I have\r\n\
    no idea what the approvingly quoted Nicola Roxon means when she asserts\r\n\
    that contemporary feminists must fight \xE2\x80\x9Cto be ourselves\xE2\x80\x9D).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    And so we are left with the bizarre hypothesis that the real problem\r\n\
    facing contemporary women is that feminists didn\xE2\x80\x99t tell them they\r\n\
    couldn\xE2\x80\x99t have it all, rather than the fact that even in post-feminist\r\n\
    times, they still can\xE2\x80\x99t.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The job of articulating this obvious truth was left to Shadow Health\r\n\
    Minister Julia Gillard who launched the book at the National Press Club\r\n\
    early this month. Gillard spoke eloquently of the need to move \xE2\x80\x9Cbeyond\r\n\
    the lament\xE2\x80\x9D and to \xE2\x80\x9Cgo forward, to carve out more change and to do what\r\n\
    we need to do now so [that the life of girls] is more full of real\r\n\
    choice than that of today\xE2\x80\x99s woman.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    You said it, sister. The question is: why didn\xE2\x80\x99t Haussegger?"

  title: "Book Review - Male Trouble: Looking at Australian Masculinities"
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:40:00
  content_markup: "<p>Male Trouble: Looking at Australian Masculinities, edited by Stephen\n\
    Tomsen and Mike Donaldson, Pluto Press, $29.95pb, 254pp, 1 86403 121 2</p>\n\n\
    <p>TEASE: In his introduction to this collection of academic essays about\n\
    different aspects and types of contemporary Australian masculinity or,\n\
    as the authors prefer, masculinities, R.W. Connell notes that: \xE2\x80\x98It is\n\
    now a familiar observation that notions of Australian identity have been\n\
    entirely constructed around images of men.\xE2\x80\x99</p>\n\n\
    <p>This is a familiar observation. Another old chestnut that better sums up\n\
    recent discussions of masculinity and men, including this book, is that\n\
    masculinity is in \xE2\x80\x98crisis\xE2\x80\x99, and that, at least in part, the solution\n\
    lies in \xE2\x80\x98problematising\xE2\x80\x99, \xE2\x80\x98deconstructing\xE2\x80\x99, \xE2\x80\x98destablising\xE2\x80\x99, and then\n\
    \xE2\x80\x98collapsing\xE2\x80\x99 it. It\xE2\x80\x99s all, as such language makes clear, terribly\n\
    sociological and cultural studies in approach. Which is not beyond\n\
    interest, once one swims beneath the dense disciplinary jargon to the\n\
    ideas beneath.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But I must be honest and say, as someone who has spent the last few\n\
    months reading everything I can get my hands on about masculinity, that\n\
    I have begun to feel somewhat downtrodden by the relentless negativity\n\
    about all things male that seems to be the sine qua non of such research\n\
    and \xE2\x80\x98discourse\xE2\x80\x99. Men, this collection argues, continue to \xE2\x80\x98construct\xE2\x80\x99\n\
    their masculinity through the degradation of the female and homosexual;\n\
    men pursue submissive wives using Internet sites that traffic poor women\n\
    from the developing world; men murder men who insult their masculinity\n\
    through homosexual advance to preserve their honour and self-respect;\n\
    the \xE2\x80\x98hyper-masculine\xE2\x80\x99 male sporting body continues to dominate sports\n\
    coverage, while the sexual objectification of the female sporting body\n\
    continues unabated. And on it goes. I can only imagine the impact such a\n\
    relentless list of \xE2\x80\x98male troubles\xE2\x80\x99 has on readers of the opposite sex.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Interestingly, a more attentive reading of many of the chapters &ndash; each\n\
    authored by academics from different institutions &ndash; reveals numerous\n\
    possibilities for optimism. While some members of the Australian navy\n\
    are doing their best to preserve the military as a place where dominant\n\
    forms of masculinity are made, Katerina Agostino\xE2\x80\x99s research reveals how\n\
    others welcome women (though they often refuse to express their support\n\
    for fear of being \xE2\x80\x98deprived of their gender status as men\xE2\x80\x99). In a\n\
    chapter on the \xE2\x80\x98masculinising institution\xE2\x80\x99 of Aussie Rules, Nikki\n\
    Wedgwood speaks of several young men who refuse to denigrate women or to\n\
    use violence on the field to subordinate other males and so assert their\n\
    manhood. Indeed, as Gary Dowsett wisely notes in his discussion of\n\
    \xE2\x80\x98Masculinity, (homo)sexuality and contemporary sexual politics\xE2\x80\x99, some\n\
    men are responding to the challenges social and economic changes have\n\
    presented to male power and privilege:</p>\n\n\
    <p>Of course, some men have not changed at all and others are too powerful\n\
    to have to bother. But some sections of the male population have faced\n\
    up squarely to the challenge of feminism and adjusted significantly. Not\n\
    all men are unwilling to change, but the process of change is difficult,\n\
    even when it is willingly pursued.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Male Trouble seems to see itself as advancing the project of \xE2\x80\x98reforming\n\
    masculinities\xE2\x80\x99 in two ways. Firstly, by contributing to recent public\n\
    debates about \xE2\x80\x98men, boys and masculinities\xE2\x80\x99, and, secondly, by\n\
    presenting cutting-edge social research to assist in the development of\n\
    \xE2\x80\x98agendas of change in arenas from health policy to family violence to\n\
    primary education\xE2\x80\x99. Taken on its own terms, it seems important to ask\n\
    how well it accomplishes these tasks.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I offer qualified ticks on both counts. As Connell notes, much public\n\
    debate about men and masculinity is marred by reactionary ideas. The\n\
    progressive outlook offered by the authors of this collection, who veer\n\
    away from psychological explanations for \xE2\x80\x98all the nasty things men do\xE2\x80\x99\n\
    and focus instead on \xE2\x80\x98institutions, power relations, and social\n\
    inequalities\xE2\x80\x99, warms the chill of the current individualistic and\n\
    biologically determinant political landscape. In particular, the use by\n\
    most authors of the terms \xE2\x80\x98hegemonic\xE2\x80\x99 to preserve the hierarchies\n\
    amongst men and resultant differences in masculinities was welcome.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I did wish the authors had put more effort into making their arguments\n\
    in plain English. This was the case firstly because, in several\n\
    instances, I suspected that jargon was not functioning in its proper\n\
    role as in-group shorthand, but, rather, obscuring a lack of analytical\n\
    precision and depth. As well, if &ndash; as Connell seems to want &ndash;\n\
    masculinity research is to impact on policy, lucid writing and material\n\
    organisation is essential. Indeed, all readers, lay or academic, would\n\
    have benefited from a standard format for each article in which the\n\
    impetus for the work, and its place in the literature, its method,\n\
    results and conclusions were all clearly laid out. Insofar as the\n\
    collection makes no bones about being for academic audiences only, I\n\
    would have preferred abstracts at the start of each piece and notes at\n\
    the end of each chapter, rather than collected at the back of the book.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The collection does provide some new and interesting research. I was\n\
    particularly fascinated by Poynting, Noble and Tabar\xE2\x80\x99s discussion of\n\
    \xE2\x80\x98Protest masculinity and Lebanese youth in western Sydney\xE2\x80\x99. The authors\n\
    present fascinating extracts from interviews with seven Lebanese youth,\n\

  content: "Male Trouble: Looking at Australian Masculinities, edited by Stephen\r\n\
    Tomsen and Mike Donaldson, Pluto Press, $29.95pb, 254pp, 1 86403 121 2\r\n\
    \r\n\
    TEASE: In his introduction to this collection of academic essays about\r\n\
    different aspects and types of contemporary Australian masculinity or,\r\n\
    as the authors prefer, masculinities, R.W. Connell notes that: \xE2\x80\x98It is\r\n\
    now a familiar observation that notions of Australian identity have been\r\n\
    entirely constructed around images of men.\xE2\x80\x99\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This is a familiar observation. Another old chestnut that better sums up\r\n\
    recent discussions of masculinity and men, including this book, is that\r\n\
    masculinity is in \xE2\x80\x98crisis\xE2\x80\x99, and that, at least in part, the solution\r\n\
    lies in \xE2\x80\x98problematising\xE2\x80\x99, \xE2\x80\x98deconstructing\xE2\x80\x99, \xE2\x80\x98destablising\xE2\x80\x99, and then\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x98collapsing\xE2\x80\x99 it. It\xE2\x80\x99s all, as such language makes clear, terribly\r\n\
    sociological and cultural studies in approach. Which is not beyond\r\n\
    interest, once one swims beneath the dense disciplinary jargon to the\r\n\
    ideas beneath.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But I must be honest and say, as someone who has spent the last few\r\n\
    months reading everything I can get my hands on about masculinity, that\r\n\
    I have begun to feel somewhat downtrodden by the relentless negativity\r\n\
    about all things male that seems to be the sine qua non of such research\r\n\
    and \xE2\x80\x98discourse\xE2\x80\x99. Men, this collection argues, continue to \xE2\x80\x98construct\xE2\x80\x99\r\n\
    their masculinity through the degradation of the female and homosexual;\r\n\
    men pursue submissive wives using Internet sites that traffic poor women\r\n\
    from the developing world; men murder men who insult their masculinity\r\n\
    through homosexual advance to preserve their honour and self-respect;\r\n\
    the \xE2\x80\x98hyper-masculine\xE2\x80\x99 male sporting body continues to dominate sports\r\n\
    coverage, while the sexual objectification of the female sporting body\r\n\
    continues unabated. And on it goes. I can only imagine the impact such a\r\n\
    relentless list of \xE2\x80\x98male troubles\xE2\x80\x99 has on readers of the opposite sex.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Interestingly, a more attentive reading of many of the chapters - each\r\n\
    authored by academics from different institutions - reveals numerous\r\n\
    possibilities for optimism. While some members of the Australian navy\r\n\
    are doing their best to preserve the military as a place where dominant\r\n\
    forms of masculinity are made, Katerina Agostino\xE2\x80\x99s research reveals how\r\n\
    others welcome women (though they often refuse to express their support\r\n\
    for fear of being \xE2\x80\x98deprived of their gender status as men\xE2\x80\x99). In a\r\n\
    chapter on the \xE2\x80\x98masculinising institution\xE2\x80\x99 of Aussie Rules, Nikki\r\n\
    Wedgwood speaks of several young men who refuse to denigrate women or to\r\n\
    use violence on the field to subordinate other males and so assert their\r\n\
    manhood. Indeed, as Gary Dowsett wisely notes in his discussion of\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x98Masculinity, (homo)sexuality and contemporary sexual politics\xE2\x80\x99, some\r\n\
    men are responding to the challenges social and economic changes have\r\n\
    presented to male power and privilege:\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Of course, some men have not changed at all and others are too powerful\r\n\
    to have to bother. But some sections of the male population have faced\r\n\
    up squarely to the challenge of feminism and adjusted significantly. Not\r\n\
    all men are unwilling to change, but the process of change is difficult,\r\n\
    even when it is willingly pursued.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Male Trouble seems to see itself as advancing the project of \xE2\x80\x98reforming\r\n\
    masculinities\xE2\x80\x99 in two ways. Firstly, by contributing to recent public\r\n\
    debates about \xE2\x80\x98men, boys and masculinities\xE2\x80\x99, and, secondly, by\r\n\
    presenting cutting-edge social research to assist in the development of\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x98agendas of change in arenas from health policy to family violence to\r\n\
    primary education\xE2\x80\x99. Taken on its own terms, it seems important to ask\r\n\
    how well it accomplishes these tasks.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I offer qualified ticks on both counts. As Connell notes, much public\r\n\
    debate about men and masculinity is marred by reactionary ideas. The\r\n\
    progressive outlook offered by the authors of this collection, who veer\r\n\
    away from psychological explanations for \xE2\x80\x98all the nasty things men do\xE2\x80\x99\r\n\
    and focus instead on \xE2\x80\x98institutions, power relations, and social\r\n\
    inequalities\xE2\x80\x99, warms the chill of the current individualistic and\r\n\
    biologically determinant political landscape. In particular, the use by\r\n\
    most authors of the terms \xE2\x80\x98hegemonic\xE2\x80\x99 to preserve the hierarchies\r\n\
    amongst men and resultant differences in masculinities was welcome.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I did wish the authors had put more effort into making their arguments\r\n\
    in plain English. This was the case firstly because, in several\r\n\
    instances, I suspected that jargon was not functioning in its proper\r\n\
    role as in-group shorthand, but, rather, obscuring a lack of analytical\r\n\
    precision and depth. As well, if - as Connell seems to want -\r\n\
    masculinity research is to impact on policy, lucid writing and material\r\n\
    organisation is essential. Indeed, all readers, lay or academic, would\r\n\
    have benefited from a standard format for each article in which the\r\n\
    impetus for the work, and its place in the literature, its method,\r\n\
    results and conclusions were all clearly laid out. Insofar as the\r\n\
    collection makes no bones about being for academic audiences only, I\r\n\
    would have preferred abstracts at the start of each piece and notes at\r\n\
    the end of each chapter, rather than collected at the back of the book.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The collection does provide some new and interesting research. I was\r\n\
    particularly fascinated by Poynting, Noble and Tabar\xE2\x80\x99s discussion of\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x98Protest masculinity and Lebanese youth in western Sydney\xE2\x80\x99. The authors\r\n\
    present fascinating extracts from interviews with seven Lebanese youth,\r\n\
    which show how \xE2\x80\x98protest\xE2\x80\x99 masculinities are formed through intersections\r\n\
    of class, gender and ethnicity. Mike Donaldson\xE2\x80\x99s chapter, \xE2\x80\x98Studying up:\r\n\
    the masculinity of the hegemonic\xE2\x80\x99, looks at the lives of ruling-class\r\n\
    men - a rarity in sociological research, which specialises in what one\r\n\
    researcher called \xE2\x80\x98taking notebook and conscience in hand and going\r\n\
    slumming\xE2\x80\x99 - in order to investigate the workings of power from another\r\n\
    angle, and to explore \xE2\x80\x98the extent to which men of great power have some\r\n\
    insight into the mechanics of its influence\xE2\x80\x99."

    Smarts lived on a island where they planted, tended and then harvested\n\
    trees from which they carved beautiful and much-sought after canoes. But\n\
    while the Very Smarts were wonderful craftspeople, they had neither the\n\
    interest nor the acumen to distribute or profit from their work.\n\
    Instead, completed canoes were rowed by the Very Smarts to the\n\
    Teleporting tribe on the mainland. There the Teleporters would put the\n\
    final touches on the canoe and, with the Very Smarts help, rate each\n\
    canoe for quality.</p>\n\n\
    <p>On the teleport home, the Very Smarts took care not to lose the\n\
    parchment on which evidence of the rating was stamped. A high rating\n\
    earned the boat builder status and power in the tribe, not to mention\n\
    the tastiest morsels and best digs, while a low rating meant disgrace\n\
    and despair. Once the Very Smarts were gone, the Teleporters got busy.\n\
    The canoes were sold to highest bidder for a handsome profit, and then\n\
    teleported to their new owners.</p>\n\n\
    <p>And so it went, for as long as anyone could remember, until one day the\n\
    Very Smarts discovered that they could teleport, too. And though it took\n\
    awhile, some Very Smarts began wondering why they ought to allow the\n\
    Teleporters to sell and distribute their highly prized canoes, now that\n\
    they could do it themselves. But others Very Smarts were less sure. If\n\
    the Teleporters didn\xE2\x80\x99t rate their work, how would they know how to\n\
    distribute social and material resources amongst the tribe?</p>\n\n\
    <p>If you\xE2\x80\x99ve been following the feisty debates on-line, in the press and in\n\
    the scholarly literature about the impact of the internet on publishing,\n\
    you\xE2\x80\x99ll have no trouble recognising the Teleporters as the publishers of\n\
    scholarly journals and the dilemma facing the Very Smarts as the same\n\
    one confronting contemporary academics in an electronic age. To solve\n\
    it, we need to look past the enthusiastic shouting of those championing\n\
    an open access future, and rapid-fire press releases from publishing\n\
    houses eager to assure us they\xE2\x80\x99ve finally cracked a viable business\n\
    model for the new age, and return to first principles. Ignoring how\n\
    we\xE2\x80\x99ve always done it and why, we need to ask the question: what is it\n\
    that academics need from, and are trying to achieve with, scholarly\n\
    publishing?</p>\n\n\
    <p>The answer is relatively simple. Academics need timely and convenient\n\
    access to the most up-to-date scholarship in their discipline and their\n\
    discipline\xE2\x80\x99s archives. They also want their own work published quickly\n\
    and disseminated widely, and to be credited for their labour in ways\n\
    that enable them to maintain their job, or even climb the ladder.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The truth, though publishers don\xE2\x80\x99t like to hear it, is that academics\n\
    and universities hold most of the cards in the scholarly publishing\n\
    game. This is not just because they do the research, write the papers\n\
    and do the unpaid work required to provide quality assurance by\n\
    reviewing the work of their peers. It is also because their primary\n\
    objective is not to profit from the distribution of their work (like the\n\
    Very Smarts, most currently earn little to nothing from the hard-copy\n\
    and electronic distribution of their oeuvres), but to have it read and\n\
    cited by others.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In the new electronic age it is hard to see why the achievement of these\n\
    goals requires the input of a professional publisher at all. Sure,\n\
    publishers currently edit academic papers prior to publication which, in\n\
    some instances, can be intensive and painstaking work. But while it has\n\
    not been exploited much to date, the expertise to perform this task too\n\
    also exists within the academic tribe, as clearly demonstrated by\n\
    in-house university journals like Monash\xE2\x80\x99s People and Place.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In fact, the only power the electronic shake-out of scholarly\n\
    communication has left to traditional publishers is that of quality\n\
    control. In academia, publication in journals like Nature and Mind still\n\
    open doors for those seeking grants or promotion. This is the Very\n\
    Smarts problem: without the stamped parchment from the Teleporters, how\n\
    will they compete for rewards?</p>\n\n\
    <p>But the truth is that new technologies are already showing the way.\n\
    Instead of relying on the publisher\xE2\x80\x99s reputation as a quality indicator,\n\
    scholars could rely on electronic citation counts: an indicator which is\n\
    not currently but can be made blind to whether the site of first\n\

  content_markup: "<p>There is no end in sight to the painful saga of the long-ago termination\n\
    of a woman with a foetus diagnosed with dwarfism in 2000. Feeling it has\n\
    no choice but to defend the principle of patient confidentiality, the\n\
    Royal Women\xE2\x80\x99s Hospital has decided to seek leave to appeal against the\n\
    Victorian magistrate\xE2\x80\x99s ruling at the end of last month. The ruling\n\
    compels the hospital to hand over the medical records of the woman known\n\
    to the public as Mrs X, despite that women\xE2\x80\x99s persistent refusal to\n\
    consent to their release.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The board needs the records to investigate the professional conduct of\n\
    the treating doctor. Should they find against him, he could be\n\
    suspended, or lose his registration.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Meanwhile, a woman continues to have one of the most private and painful\n\
    episodes of her life &ndash; one that drove her to the brink of suicide &ndash;\n\
    splashed across the pages of the newspapers to be discussed and\n\
    dissected by strangers.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The driver behind this tragic state of affairs is anti-choice National\n\
    Party Senator Julian McGauran. McGauran\xE2\x80\x99s zealous pursuit of the issue,\n\
    first through the Coroner\xE2\x80\x99s Court and now the Medical Practitioners\n\
    Board, appears to be driven by a number of agendas.</p>\n\n\
    <p>One is to raise public awareness of the dog\xE2\x80\x99s breakfast of Victorian\n\
    laws and court judgements that on the one hand defines abortion\n\
    providers and aborting women as criminals, but on the other enable\n\
    doctors to lawfully provide the procedure if they deem it \xE2\x80\x9Cnecessary\xE2\x80\x9D to\n\
    preserve the woman\xE2\x80\x99s physical or mental health.</p>\n\n\
    <p>At the same time, the Crimes Act suggest the possibility that even\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cnecessary\xE2\x80\x9D abortions may be illicit if they are done on a viable\n\
    foetus. Such \xE2\x80\x9Cchild destruction\xE2\x80\x9D laws have never been tested in court.\n\
    This means that the gestational age at which a foetus is considered to\n\
    be capable of being born alive, or the conditions under which a viable\n\
    foetus may be lawfully aborted is simply not known. When the mother\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    life is at risk? Her physical or mental health in peril?</p>\n\n\
    <p>The senator may hope that if he succeeds in having the Medical\n\
    Practitioners Board sanction the doctor who did the abortion, he will be\n\
    one step closer to the anti-choice dream of turning Victoria back to a\n\
    state where the legislative view of abortion as a crime prevails over\n\
    the judicial understanding of the procedure as a sometimes necessary\n\
    health intervention.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Indeed, McGauran may already have achieved this end &ndash; and more &ndash; no\n\
    matter what decision the board ultimately makes. Since that fateful day\n\
    in 2000, when a kind-hearted deeply ethical man with a long history of\n\

  content: "There is no end in sight to the painful saga of the long-ago termination\r\n\
    of a woman with a foetus diagnosed with dwarfism in 2000. Feeling it has\r\n\
    no choice but to defend the principle of patient confidentiality, the\r\n\
    Royal Women\xE2\x80\x99s Hospital has decided to seek leave to appeal against the\r\n\
    Victorian magistrate\xE2\x80\x99s ruling at the end of last month. The ruling\r\n\
    compels the hospital to hand over the medical records of the woman known\r\n\
    to the public as Mrs X, despite that women\xE2\x80\x99s persistent refusal to\r\n\
    consent to their release.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The board needs the records to investigate the professional conduct of\r\n\
    the treating doctor. Should they find against him, he could be\r\n\
    suspended, or lose his registration.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Meanwhile, a woman continues to have one of the most private and painful\r\n\
    episodes of her life - one that drove her to the brink of suicide -\r\n\
    splashed across the pages of the newspapers to be discussed and\r\n\
    dissected by strangers.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The driver behind this tragic state of affairs is anti-choice National\r\n\
    Party Senator Julian McGauran. McGauran\xE2\x80\x99s zealous pursuit of the issue,\r\n\
    first through the Coroner\xE2\x80\x99s Court and now the Medical Practitioners\r\n\
    Board, appears to be driven by a number of agendas.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    One is to raise public awareness of the dog\xE2\x80\x99s breakfast of Victorian\r\n\
    laws and court judgements that on the one hand defines abortion\r\n\
    providers and aborting women as criminals, but on the other enable\r\n\
    doctors to lawfully provide the procedure if they deem it \xE2\x80\x9Cnecessary\xE2\x80\x9D to\r\n\
    preserve the woman\xE2\x80\x99s physical or mental health.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    At the same time, the Crimes Act suggest the possibility that even\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cnecessary\xE2\x80\x9D abortions may be illicit if they are done on a viable\r\n\
    foetus. Such \xE2\x80\x9Cchild destruction\xE2\x80\x9D laws have never been tested in court.\r\n\
    This means that the gestational age at which a foetus is considered to\r\n\
    be capable of being born alive, or the conditions under which a viable\r\n\
    foetus may be lawfully aborted is simply not known. When the mother\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    life is at risk? Her physical or mental health in peril?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The senator may hope that if he succeeds in having the Medical\r\n\
    Practitioners Board sanction the doctor who did the abortion, he will be\r\n\
    one step closer to the anti-choice dream of turning Victoria back to a\r\n\
    state where the legislative view of abortion as a crime prevails over\r\n\
    the judicial understanding of the procedure as a sometimes necessary\r\n\
    health intervention.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Indeed, McGauran may already have achieved this end - and more - no\r\n\
    matter what decision the board ultimately makes. Since that fateful day\r\n\
    in 2000, when a kind-hearted deeply ethical man with a long history of\r\n\
    commitment to women\xE2\x80\x99s health and autonomy decided - in consultation with\r\n\
    colleagues, including a qualified psychiatrist who judged the woman\r\n\
    acutely suicidal - to perform the abortion, his life has been hell, his\r\n\
    job threatened, his career in tatters, his ability to defend himself\r\n\
    impeded.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    There wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t be an abortion service provider in the state, probably\r\n\

  title: Abortion case could set an ugly precedent
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:39:37
  content_markup: "<p>We should not further restrict women\xE2\x80\x99s access to late abortions, writes\n\
    Leslie Cannold. The charging of Dr Suman Sood for manslaughter and\n\
    procuring an unlawful abortion in NSW is the first such prosecution in\n\
    that state since 1971, though it was only seven years ago that two West\n\
    Australian doctors were charged as criminals for providing terminations.\n\
    Indeed, Australia has a long history of prosecuting women and doctors\n\
    over abortions and, because of the consistent refusal of politicians to\n\
    legislate progressively on the issue, common law rulings have had a\n\
    profound impact on the development of abortion law.</p>\n\n\
    <p>What might Sood\xE2\x80\x99s prosecution &ndash; for terminating the pregnancy of a woman\n\
    who was between 21 to 24 weeks pregnant &ndash; mean for the women of NSW and\n\
    the nation? If found guilty, she could be jailed and deregistered,\n\
    relieving women of the risks they were unknowingly assuming by placing\n\
    themselves in the doctor\xE2\x80\x99s care.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But the DPP\xE2\x80\x99s prosecutory strategy may also pose significant risks to\n\
    Australian women\xE2\x80\x99s reproductive autonomy and health. If successful, it\n\
    will reaffirm the regulation of abortion under the Crimes, rather than\n\
    the Health Act, and by so doing the potential criminality of abortion\n\
    service providers and their patients. This reassertion of the\n\
    quasi-illicit nature of the procedure will ensure that it continues to\n\
    be surrounded by secrecy and stigma and, as a result, that women\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    access to quality information and timely services suffers.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It will also give a new millennium stamp of approval to the law\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    patronising contempt of women\xE2\x80\x99s capacity to make important moral\n\
    decisions for themselves and by themselves, without judicial approval or\n\
    medical oversight. Such a reconfirmation of women\xE2\x80\x99s status as\n\
    second-class citizens in need of patriarchal guidance could be felt\n\
    across Australia. Not just because of the anti-choice rabidity of\n\
    powerful players in the Howard Government, but because of its\n\
    potentially persuasive effect on states with similar legal frameworks.\n\
    Reconfirmation of the legal status quo in NSW, in other words, might\n\
    lead other states, like Victoria, to affix fresh seals of approval on\n\
    their existing abortion laws. A particular worry is that the Bracks\n\
    Government, now modernising the criminal code, might leave Victoria\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    archaic abortion statutes untouched.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But it is the manslaughter charge that has the greatest potential to\n\
    undermine women\xE2\x80\x99s reproductive autonomy, although it may also offer the\n\
    possibility of more ethical care for pregnant women. As usual, it is the\n\
    small number of women seeking post\xE2\x80\x9320-week terminations that are at\n\
    greatest risk of a loss of dignity, quality of care or services all\n\
    together. Figures suggest most women terminating later are responding to\n\
    the diagnosis of serious foetal defects, including conditions that will\n\
    lead the baby to suffer and die shortly after birth. Not surprisingly,\n\
    some women and couples opt for termination as the most ethical option in\n\
    such tragic, no-win circumstances.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But what many people do not know is that women are finding it harder and\n\
    harder to access post~~20-week terminations inside and outside of\n\
    hospitals. Across the country, only a few clinics provide them.\n\
    Increasing numbers of hospitals are refusing to offer any on religious\n\
    grounds, while others have adopted time-consuming and secretive\n\
    assessment processes that deliver verdicts~~ on unclear grounds &ndash; to\n\
    women about their eligibility for services.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In addition, most clinics and hospitals compel women to labour and give\n\
    birth to their dead baby, despite clear and convincing evidence that in\n\
    skilled hands, surgical termination improves women\xE2\x80\x99s physical and mental\n\
    outcomes.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Unlike a surgical procedure, induction of labour carries the risk of a\n\
    foetus being born alive. This is what happened in Sood\xE2\x80\x99s case, and may\n\
    account for the manslaughter charge. Of course, not all foetuses born\n\
    alive are viable. A recent study of British and Irish birth outcomes\n\
    found that of those born before 24 weeks, only 15 per cent left hospital\n\
    and half of these had significant cognitive and neurological impairment.</p>\n\n\
    <p>However, the low survive-and-thrive rate of infants at \xE2\x80\x9Cthreshold\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    viability does not change the moral and medical unacceptability of\n\
    allowing foetuses to live, and possibly suffer through, the abortive\n\
    procedure. If a guilty verdict in Sood\xE2\x80\x99s case means that doctors will in\n\
    future select procedures where this cannot happen, then women and their\n\

  content: "We should not further restrict women\xE2\x80\x99s access to late abortions, writes\r\n\
    Leslie Cannold. The charging of Dr Suman Sood for manslaughter and\r\n\
    procuring an unlawful abortion in NSW is the first such prosecution in\r\n\
    that state since 1971, though it was only seven years ago that two West\r\n\
    Australian doctors were charged as criminals for providing terminations.\r\n\
    Indeed, Australia has a long history of prosecuting women and doctors\r\n\
    over abortions and, because of the consistent refusal of politicians to\r\n\
    legislate progressively on the issue, common law rulings have had a\r\n\
    profound impact on the development of abortion law.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    What might Sood\xE2\x80\x99s prosecution - for terminating the pregnancy of a woman\r\n\
    who was between 21 to 24 weeks pregnant - mean for the women of NSW and\r\n\
    the nation? If found guilty, she could be jailed and deregistered,\r\n\
    relieving women of the risks they were unknowingly assuming by placing\r\n\
    themselves in the doctor\xE2\x80\x99s care.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But the DPP\xE2\x80\x99s prosecutory strategy may also pose significant risks to\r\n\
    Australian women\xE2\x80\x99s reproductive autonomy and health. If successful, it\r\n\
    will reaffirm the regulation of abortion under the Crimes, rather than\r\n\
    the Health Act, and by so doing the potential criminality of abortion\r\n\
    service providers and their patients. This reassertion of the\r\n\
    quasi-illicit nature of the procedure will ensure that it continues to\r\n\
    be surrounded by secrecy and stigma and, as a result, that women\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    access to quality information and timely services suffers.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It will also give a new millennium stamp of approval to the law\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    patronising contempt of women\xE2\x80\x99s capacity to make important moral\r\n\
    decisions for themselves and by themselves, without judicial approval or\r\n\
    medical oversight. Such a reconfirmation of women\xE2\x80\x99s status as\r\n\
    second-class citizens in need of patriarchal guidance could be felt\r\n\
    across Australia. Not just because of the anti-choice rabidity of\r\n\
    powerful players in the Howard Government, but because of its\r\n\
    potentially persuasive effect on states with similar legal frameworks.\r\n\
    Reconfirmation of the legal status quo in NSW, in other words, might\r\n\
    lead other states, like Victoria, to affix fresh seals of approval on\r\n\
    their existing abortion laws. A particular worry is that the Bracks\r\n\
    Government, now modernising the criminal code, might leave Victoria\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    archaic abortion statutes untouched.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But it is the manslaughter charge that has the greatest potential to\r\n\
    undermine women\xE2\x80\x99s reproductive autonomy, although it may also offer the\r\n\
    possibility of more ethical care for pregnant women. As usual, it is the\r\n\
    small number of women seeking post\xE2\x80\x9320-week terminations that are at\r\n\
    greatest risk of a loss of dignity, quality of care or services all\r\n\
    together. Figures suggest most women terminating later are responding to\r\n\
    the diagnosis of serious foetal defects, including conditions that will\r\n\
    lead the baby to suffer and die shortly after birth. Not surprisingly,\r\n\
    some women and couples opt for termination as the most ethical option in\r\n\
    such tragic, no-win circumstances.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But what many people do not know is that women are finding it harder and\r\n\
    harder to access post~~20-week terminations inside and outside of\r\n\
    hospitals. Across the country, only a few clinics provide them.\r\n\
    Increasing numbers of hospitals are refusing to offer any on religious\r\n\
    grounds, while others have adopted time-consuming and secretive\r\n\
    assessment processes that deliver verdicts~~ on unclear grounds - to\r\n\
    women about their eligibility for services.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In addition, most clinics and hospitals compel women to labour and give\r\n\
    birth to their dead baby, despite clear and convincing evidence that in\r\n\
    skilled hands, surgical termination improves women\xE2\x80\x99s physical and mental\r\n\
    outcomes.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Unlike a surgical procedure, induction of labour carries the risk of a\r\n\
    foetus being born alive. This is what happened in Sood\xE2\x80\x99s case, and may\r\n\
    account for the manslaughter charge. Of course, not all foetuses born\r\n\
    alive are viable. A recent study of British and Irish birth outcomes\r\n\
    found that of those born before 24 weeks, only 15 per cent left hospital\r\n\
    and half of these had significant cognitive and neurological impairment.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    However, the low survive-and-thrive rate of infants at \xE2\x80\x9Cthreshold\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    viability does not change the moral and medical unacceptability of\r\n\
    allowing foetuses to live, and possibly suffer through, the abortive\r\n\
    procedure. If a guilty verdict in Sood\xE2\x80\x99s case means that doctors will in\r\n\
    future select procedures where this cannot happen, then women and their\r\n\
    families - knowing they have acted to prevent suffering, not cause it -\r\n\
    will benefit. What we can\xE2\x80\x99t allow is medical practitioners using the\r\n\
    manslaughter charge as another excuse to further tighten women\xE2\x80\x99s access\r\n\
    to post\xE2\x80\x9320-week procedures. Nationally, the numbers of such procedures\r\n\
    is small (about 4 per cent), but each one is a tale of heartache,\r\n\
    ethical dilemma and considered moral decision-making by the only people\r\n\
    with the information to know what\xE2\x80\x99s necessary and right: the woman and,\r\n\
    if she has one, her partner.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Society must not tolerate rogue medical providers. But neither must we\r\n\
    allow isolated cases to deprive women and couples of critical health\r\n\
    care when they need it."

  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:39:26
  content_markup: "<p>Call Me Elizabeth: Wife, mother, escort A true story by Dawn Annandale\n\
    (Time Warner 2005). Callgirl: Confessions of a double life by Jeanette\n\
    Angell (Schwartz, 2005)</p>\n\n\
    <p>TEASE: It\xE2\x80\x99s a big year for books on prostitution, with Call Me Elizabeth\n\
    and Callgirl only some of the volumes weighing down gender studies\n\
    shelves across the nation. At the start of Callgirl Angell gives us an\n\
    inkling as to the cause of the current obsession when she writes that\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cpeople look at me and get a little scared. I could be &ndash; I am &ndash; one of\n\
    them. I am their sister, their neighbour, their girlfriend. I\xE2\x80\x99m nobody\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    idea of what a whore looks like. Maybe that\xE2\x80\x99s why I\xE2\x80\x99m scary. They want\n\
    callgirls to be different, identifiable. That keeps them safe.\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    Thirty-five years after second-wave feminism and in the midst of rising\n\
    divorce rates, declining fertility and increasing numbers of women\n\
    willing and able &ndash; should a suitable male fail to appear &ndash; to go\n\
    motherhood alone, many of us are confused not just about what women\n\
    want, but who women really are. Exposes of the secret worlds of women\n\
    who appear average or even respectable on the outside tantalises us with\n\
    the prospect of finding out.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In important ways, the stories of both women &ndash; one British, the other\n\
    American &ndash; and the first-person narrative form in which they tell them,\n\
    are strikingly similar. Women facing fiscal ruin from good-for-nothing\n\
    men, and making peanuts in their day job, give into the lure of the\n\
    $200USD or 125 pounds per hour pay rate for women willing to have sex\n\
    with strangers. From their first encounter to the ongoing maintenance of\n\
    their sanity, physical health and secrecy as they pursue their\n\
    alternative career through long gruelling nights, both Call Me Elizabeth\n\
    and Callgirl provide a straightforward and informative trek through the\n\
    comforts, tedium and insult of selling one\xE2\x80\x99s body for a living.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But here\xE2\x80\x99s where the similarities end. Call Me Elizabeth reads like one\n\
    long mea culpa from the incarnated stereotype of a whore with the heart\n\
    of gold. Annandale claims that the only reason she works as an escort is\n\
    to save her children being \xE2\x80\x9Cdestabalised\xE2\x80\x9D by changes to home and school\n\
    that would accompany the family\xE2\x80\x99s financial ruin. For Annandale,\n\
    prostitution is never anything but \xE2\x80\x9Cexhausting, awful, degrading\xE2\x80\x9D but\n\
    necessary for a woman with a drawerful of bills and an selfless\n\
    commitment to doing whatever it takes to protect her family. Indeed, she\n\
    desperate is Annandale for us to see her as a good mother that she not\n\
    only repeats her family-oriented motives ad nauseum, but quotes others\n\
    who understand her behaviourthis way. At the end of her first night with\n\
    her driver Kevin, for example, she tells how he helped her out of the\n\
    car and said something that stayed with her:</p>\n\n\
    <p>[He] told me that he wished he had a mother like me, someone who had\n\
    loved him in the way that I obviously loved my children. \xE2\x80\x98Hold your head\n\
    up, darlin\xE2\x80\x99, you\xE2\x80\x99re fuckin\xE2\x80\x99 special, you are\xE2\x80\x99. In contrast, Angell\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    credentials as an academic sociologist lead her to attempt a more\n\
    sophisticated analysis of prostitution, though with somewhat mixed\n\
    success. In the early pages of the book, she pursues a\n\
    prostitution-is-no-more-degrading-to-women-than-oppressive-low-paid-work\n\
    and an all-sex-is-an-exchange-of-sorts line. Angell even suggests that\n\
    her considerable sex drive and mastery at pleasuring others means her\n\
    work offers a double bonus of sexual pleasure and pay. But by chapter 3\n\
    this switches &ndash; with no explanation &ndash; to a more matter-of-fact\n\
    understanding of prostitution as wearing, degrading and at times\n\
    dangerous work that women only undertake because they desperately needs\n\
    the cash. \xE2\x80\x9CThe fact is,\xE2\x80\x9D writes Angell, \xE2\x80\x9Cit was prostitution. You can\n\
    dress it up however you\xE2\x80\x99d like; but for me to tell myself that earning\n\
    my living as a prostitute was a situation that couldn\xE2\x80\x99t get any better\n\
    was at best a little na\xC3\xAFve. At worst a little delusional.\xE2\x80\x9D A callgirl,\n\
    Angell tells us, gets about as much excitement out of a call as she does\n\
    going out to the supermarket.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I have no problem with the conclusion that prostitution is oppressive.\n\
    Indeed, Angell\xE2\x80\x99s blow-by-blow description of her clientele &ndash; some of\n\
    whom manipulate, insult and even assault her &ndash; leaves little doubt as to\n\
    how she arrived there. But I was left wondering how such a conclusion\n\
    jived with her seeming rejection of classic feminist analysis of\n\
    prostitution as degrading to women: a rejection she seems to transport\n\

  content: "Call Me Elizabeth: Wife, mother, escort A true story by Dawn Annandale\r\n\
    (Time Warner 2005). Callgirl: Confessions of a double life by Jeanette\r\n\
    Angell (Schwartz, 2005)\r\n\
    \r\n\
    TEASE: It\xE2\x80\x99s a big year for books on prostitution, with Call Me Elizabeth\r\n\
    and Callgirl only some of the volumes weighing down gender studies\r\n\
    shelves across the nation. At the start of Callgirl Angell gives us an\r\n\
    inkling as to the cause of the current obsession when she writes that\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cpeople look at me and get a little scared. I could be - I am - one of\r\n\
    them. I am their sister, their neighbour, their girlfriend. I\xE2\x80\x99m nobody\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    idea of what a whore looks like. Maybe that\xE2\x80\x99s why I\xE2\x80\x99m scary. They want\r\n\
    callgirls to be different, identifiable. That keeps them safe.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    Thirty-five years after second-wave feminism and in the midst of rising\r\n\
    divorce rates, declining fertility and increasing numbers of women\r\n\
    willing and able - should a suitable male fail to appear - to go\r\n\
    motherhood alone, many of us are confused not just about what women\r\n\
    want, but who women really are. Exposes of the secret worlds of women\r\n\
    who appear average or even respectable on the outside tantalises us with\r\n\
    the prospect of finding out.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In important ways, the stories of both women - one British, the other\r\n\
    American - and the first-person narrative form in which they tell them,\r\n\
    are strikingly similar. Women facing fiscal ruin from good-for-nothing\r\n\
    men, and making peanuts in their day job, give into the lure of the\r\n\
    $200USD or 125 pounds per hour pay rate for women willing to have sex\r\n\
    with strangers. From their first encounter to the ongoing maintenance of\r\n\
    their sanity, physical health and secrecy as they pursue their\r\n\
    alternative career through long gruelling nights, both Call Me Elizabeth\r\n\
    and Callgirl provide a straightforward and informative trek through the\r\n\
    comforts, tedium and insult of selling one\xE2\x80\x99s body for a living.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But here\xE2\x80\x99s where the similarities end. Call Me Elizabeth reads like one\r\n\
    long mea culpa from the incarnated stereotype of a whore with the heart\r\n\
    of gold. Annandale claims that the only reason she works as an escort is\r\n\
    to save her children being \xE2\x80\x9Cdestabalised\xE2\x80\x9D by changes to home and school\r\n\
    that would accompany the family\xE2\x80\x99s financial ruin. For Annandale,\r\n\
    prostitution is never anything but \xE2\x80\x9Cexhausting, awful, degrading\xE2\x80\x9D but\r\n\
    necessary for a woman with a drawerful of bills and an selfless\r\n\
    commitment to doing whatever it takes to protect her family. Indeed, she\r\n\
    desperate is Annandale for us to see her as a good mother that she not\r\n\
    only repeats her family-oriented motives ad nauseum, but quotes others\r\n\
    who understand her behaviourthis way. At the end of her first night with\r\n\
    her driver Kevin, for example, she tells how he helped her out of the\r\n\
    car and said something that stayed with her:\r\n\
    \r\n\
    [He] told me that he wished he had a mother like me, someone who had\r\n\
    loved him in the way that I obviously loved my children. \xE2\x80\x98Hold your head\r\n\
    up, darlin\xE2\x80\x99, you\xE2\x80\x99re fuckin\xE2\x80\x99 special, you are\xE2\x80\x99. In contrast, Angell\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    credentials as an academic sociologist lead her to attempt a more\r\n\
    sophisticated analysis of prostitution, though with somewhat mixed\r\n\
    success. In the early pages of the book, she pursues a\r\n\
    prostitution-is-no-more-degrading-to-women-than-oppressive-low-paid-work\r\n\
    and an all-sex-is-an-exchange-of-sorts line. Angell even suggests that\r\n\
    her considerable sex drive and mastery at pleasuring others means her\r\n\
    work offers a double bonus of sexual pleasure and pay. But by chapter 3\r\n\
    this switches - with no explanation - to a more matter-of-fact\r\n\
    understanding of prostitution as wearing, degrading and at times\r\n\
    dangerous work that women only undertake because they desperately needs\r\n\
    the cash. \xE2\x80\x9CThe fact is,\xE2\x80\x9D writes Angell, \xE2\x80\x9Cit was prostitution. You can\r\n\
    dress it up however you\xE2\x80\x99d like; but for me to tell myself that earning\r\n\
    my living as a prostitute was a situation that couldn\xE2\x80\x99t get any better\r\n\
    was at best a little na\xC3\xAFve. At worst a little delusional.\xE2\x80\x9D A callgirl,\r\n\
    Angell tells us, gets about as much excitement out of a call as she does\r\n\
    going out to the supermarket.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I have no problem with the conclusion that prostitution is oppressive.\r\n\
    Indeed, Angell\xE2\x80\x99s blow-by-blow description of her clientele - some of\r\n\
    whom manipulate, insult and even assault her - leaves little doubt as to\r\n\
    how she arrived there. But I was left wondering how such a conclusion\r\n\
    jived with her seeming rejection of classic feminist analysis of\r\n\
    prostitution as degrading to women: a rejection she seems to transport\r\n\
    into the undergraduate class she teaches on the history and sociology of\r\n\
    prostitution. Or her assertion that prostitution ought to be legalised.\r\n\
    And how do Angell\xE2\x80\x99s repeated assertions that she\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cnobody\xE2\x80\x99s idea of\r\n\
    what a whore looks like\xE2\x80\x9D fit with her consistent line that any woman -\r\n\
    our sisters, neighbours or girlfriends - could and may very well be\r\n\
    callgirls? Add to this an exasperatingly posey and staccato prose style,\r\n\
    and it seems unlikely those interested in a sustained and satisfying\r\n\
    experiential exploration of prostitution will be satisfied with\r\n\
    Callgirl."

    political parties with anti-choice Senator Brian Harradine in 1996 to\n\
    ensure his vote for the partial privitisation of Telstra. In exchange,\n\
    and to their eternal shame, both Labor and the Coalition voted with the\n\
    Tasmanian Senator to effectively ban Australian women from accessing a\n\
    drug called mifepristone or RU486 by requiring the Health Minister to\n\
    personally approve the importation, evaluation, registration and listing\n\

    <p>Of course, the effective banning of mifepristone has not only denied\n\
    women access to a safe effective non-surgical method of abortion able to\n\
    be used the moment an unwanted pregnancy is discovered (surgical\n\
    terminations can not be done before the 5th or 6th week of pregnancy).\n\
    It has also led women needing emergency contraception with fewer\n\
    side-effects, and women seeking an effective method of oestrogen-free\n\
    contraception to miss out. As well, the ban has left patients with\n\
    breast cancer, prostate cancer, inoperable meningiomas and Cushing\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    Syndrome in the lurch. Indeed, so important is mifepristone to\n\
    Australian patients in general, and female patients in particular, that\n\
    the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and\n\
    Gynaecologists recently called on the government to review the drug\xE2\x80\x99s\n\

    <p>Of course, Harradine was a wily and experienced legislator who knew\n\

  title: Paternity Fraud or Paternal Discrepancy?
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:39:15
  content_markup: "<p>\xE2\x80\x9CPaternity Fraud\xE2\x80\x9D implies deceptive women cuckholding men into believing\n\
    children are biologically theirs. But the truth is more complex, and\n\
    more human.</p>\n\n\
    <p>While the DNA paternity test has been around since the early 1980s, it\n\
    was not until the mid\xE2\x80\x931990s that the moral panic about what father\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    rights activists call \xE2\x80\x9Cpaternity fraud\xE2\x80\x9D took flight in Australia.\n\
    Instigated by the Child Support (Assessment) Act of 1989, the Act\n\
    effectively transformed the age-old definition of a father: from the man\n\
    married to a child\xE2\x80\x99s biological mother, to the man whose sperm caused\n\
    the child to be conceived. Designed to compel men to take fiscal\n\
    responsibility for the fruit of their loins, the new law was lauded by\n\
    politicians as a boon to both women and children.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Overnight, the new law changed the world for separated and divorced men.\n\
    While previous support arrangements had largely left such men in control\n\
    of decisions about whether and to what extent they would provide\n\
    financial support for the children of failed relationships ~~60% to 70%\n\
    found it easy to evade court-ordered maintenance and pay nothing~~ the\n\
    new act used set formulas to assign child support liabilities that could\n\
    be automatically deducted from a man\xE2\x80\x99s salary or from his bank account.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The only recourse for men hoping to escape what one commentator\n\
    sympathetic to the Father\xE2\x80\x99s Rights cause recently referred to as the\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cclutches\xE2\x80\x9D of the Child Support Agency is to disprove biological\n\
    paternity. So, perhaps not surprisingly, the Act\xE2\x80\x99s passage saw DNA labs\n\
    bloom across the commercial landscape like desert flowers, marketing\n\
    paternal anxiety to men and promising \xE2\x80\x9Cpeace of mind\xE2\x80\x9D from between $150\n\
    to $825 (if you want the results to stand up in court). By early 2000,\n\
    Father\xE2\x80\x99s Rights Groups were insisting on the basis of discredited or\n\
    even non-existent data sets that between 10 to 30% of Australian\n\
    children were being parented by men who were not the biological father,\n\
    and viciously attacking academics &ndash; like Swinburne\xE2\x80\x99s Professor Michael\n\
    Gilding &ndash; who tried to set the record straight (Gilding\xE2\x80\x99s published\n\
    results showing the Australian rate is likely to be between 1 and 3%).</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Australian face of paternity fraud is Melbourne man Liam Magill. In\n\
    2002, Magill\xE2\x80\x99s ex-wife Meredith was ordered to pay him $70,000 for\n\
    general damages and the economic loss he suffered as a consequence of\n\
    her false declaration that he was, as one newspaper report put it, the\n\
    biological father of \xE2\x80\x9Cher lover\xE2\x80\x99s children\xE2\x80\x9D. The case continues to fight\n\
    its way through the courts, with the High Court of Australia last week\n\
    granting Mr Magill leave to contest the Victorian Supreme Court\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    reversal of his victory and continue his case for compensation. But,\n\
    however the highest court in the land ultimately rules, Magill\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    predicament &ndash; and the anxieties of fathers over legally intertwined\n\
    questions of biological paternity and fiscal responsibility &ndash; have had a\n\
    profound impact on government policy. In June this year, the\n\
    Attorney-General Philip Ruddock amended the Family Law Act to make it\n\
    easier for men to reclaim child maintenance or property transferred to a\n\
    child that DNA testing reveals isn\xE2\x80\x99t really \xE2\x80\x9Ctheirs\xE2\x80\x9D. Around the same\n\
    time, the Government took delivery of what has become known as the\n\
    Parkinson report which recommends that men disputing biological\n\
    paternity be allowed to suspend child support payments for as long as it\n\
    takes to resolve the issue.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It is men &ndash; or what President of the Australian Law Reform Commission\n\
    Professor David Weisbrot calls \xE2\x80\x9Cputative\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cangry dads\xE2\x80\x99 &ndash; that\n\
    dominate debates about child support and paternity fraud. While their\n\
    bitter denunciations of women who\xE2\x80\x9Dcheat and lie\" echo through\n\
    cyber-space, in real life such men contribute the bulk of submissions to\n\
    the ALRC\xE2\x80\x99s recent inquiry into the privacy of genetic information and,\n\
    through their endless complaints to local MPs, instigate inquires like\n\
    the 2003 one into child custody arrangements that ultimately led to the\n\
    Parkinson report. The voices of children and women are rarely heard.\n\
    Indeed, even in the wake of her victory in the Victorian Supreme Court,\n\
    Meredith Magill refused to grant interviews to any of the assembled\n\
    reporters.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The work of Dr Lyn Turney, a researcher at Swinburne, suggests that this\n\
    is not surprising. Turney\xE2\x80\x99s groundbreaking research on women who keep\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cpaternity secrets,\xE2\x80\x9D which appeared in the most recent issue of the\n\
    Journal of Family Studies, argues that the panic surrounding paternity\n\
    fraud paints mothers as the central \xE2\x80\x9Cmoral threat\xE2\x80\x9D to social stability.\n\
    Charged as sexual deviants for the dual \xE2\x80\x9Ccrimes\xE2\x80\x9D of infidelity and\n\
    sluttishly having more than one partner &ndash; while posing in the community\n\
    as \xE2\x80\x9Cgood\xE2\x80\x9D wives and mothers &ndash; the behaviour of such women is depicted as\n\
    morally indefensible. Says Turney: \xE2\x80\x9CThey encapsulate not only female\n\
    sexuality out of control but also a view of women as predatory,\n\
    deceptive, and instrumental\xE2\x80\x9D. No wonder they don\xE2\x80\x99t want to stick their\n\
    heads above the parapet.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But Turney wanted to know more. In particular, what led women to have\n\
    and to keep \xE2\x80\x9Cpaternity secrets\xE2\x80\x9D? Her results, the outcome of interviews\n\
    with 15 Australian women, are testament to the stubborn opacity of\n\
    conception, the complexity of human relationships and the way in which\n\
    both shame and violence shape women\xE2\x80\x99s sexual and reproductive lives.</p>\n\n\
    <p>As it turns out, Kathleen Donnelly, the past girlfriend of Health\n\
    Minister Tony Abbott who publicly &ndash; and mistakenly &ndash; declared him the\n\
    father of their long-ago adopted son, is not the only Australian woman\n\
    to be confused about the genetic paternity of her offspring. In Turney\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    sample, a number of women admitted to uncertainty about which man was\n\
    the genetic father of their child.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But few of these women\xE2\x80\x99s stories conformed to the \xE2\x80\x9Cpaternity fraud\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    stereotype of faithless wives with regular lovers. Instead, the women\n\
    Turney interviewed told of sexual relationships that \xE2\x80\x9Coverlapped\xE2\x80\x9D or\n\
    happened \xE2\x80\x9Cin quick succession,\xE2\x80\x9D as well as \xE2\x80\x9Cone-off\xE2\x80\x9D encounters with\n\
    friends, acquaintance and old-flames that usually didn\xE2\x80\x99t involve either\n\
    infidelity or deception because the women were either unattached or only\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cminimally attached\xE2\x80\x9D to a dying, old or embryonic relationship at the\n\
    time. One woman, for example, had unplanned sex with a long-time friend:\n\
    her first encounter after the death of her husband a year earlier.\n\
    Several days later, she met a new man who became her regular partner.\n\
    Another woman told of a single sexual liaison with an old flame while\n\
    single and trying to conceive a child with a known-donor. Both of these\n\
    women, as well as others to whom Turney spoke, had dismissed the\n\
    reproductive potential of these one-off encounters because they wanted\n\
    to believe that their chosen or permanent partner &ndash; the one with whom\n\
    they were having regular unprotected sex &ndash; was the genetic father. It\n\
    was only when the baby bore a similarity to the biological father at\n\
    birth, or the woman later happened upon a childhood photograph of the\n\
    biological father, that the connection was made and the biological\n\
    realities of the situation accepted.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The threat of sexual violence or shaming also explains a number of cases\n\
    of \xE2\x80\x9Cpaternity fraud\xE2\x80\x9D. Several women, some of whom confessed\n\
    stomach-turning tales of rape and abuse, withheld doubts about their\n\
    child\xE2\x80\x99s paternity for fear of their partners\xE2\x80\x99 response. One woman told\n\
    of being raped by a family friend and, believing herself to be at fault\n\
    because she \xE2\x80\x9Ctrusted him\xE2\x80\x9D, never told anyone of the assault or her\n\
    subsequent doubts about paternity.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Turney also cites several instances where older domineering husbands\n\
    organized sexual liaisons &ndash; in the context of an \xE2\x80\x9Copen marriage\xE2\x80\x9D and\n\
    plenty of drugs and alcohol &ndash; in which their wives participated. When\n\
    the women subsequently raised questions about the paternity of resulting\n\
    children, the husbands \xE2\x80\x9Cmuted\xE2\x80\x9D the discussion by \xE2\x80\x9Chighlighting the\n\
    women\xE2\x80\x99s\xE2\x80\xA6sexual transgressions\xE2\x80\x9D and threatening them with public\n\
    disclosure. Such men \xE2\x80\x9Cdrew upon the moral panic,\xE2\x80\x9D in other words, to\n\
    stop the woman revealing the secret about the child\xE2\x80\x99s paternity not to\n\
    the social father &ndash; who knew exactly what was going on &ndash; but to society\n\
    at large. Only when the relationship broke down, and the question of\n\
    support payments arose, did the men question the child\xE2\x80\x99s biological\n\
    paternity.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Abortion was considered by several women unsure about which man caused\n\
    their pregnancy, but the men in their lives were not always supportive.\n\
    The Catholic step-father of a 16 year-old told her he would never speak\n\
    to her again if she had an abortion, while a GP to whom another woman\n\
    confessed her lack of paternity certainty counselled her to \xE2\x80\x9Cgo ahead\n\
    with the pregnancy and see what happens\xE2\x80\x9D. In one instance, the\n\
    suggestion of abortion triggered an angry response from the woman\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    partner because she was threatening to \xE2\x80\x9Ckill [a] baby that was probably\n\
    his\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The knowledge that some \xE2\x80\x9Cdefrauded\xE2\x80\x9D dads have about women\xE2\x80\x99s paternity\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Csecrets\xE2\x80\x99 is perhaps the most important &ndash; and surprising &ndash; of Turney\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    findings. From the wife-swapping husband, to the abortion-opposing\n\
    partner, to the spouse who knew his wife had conceived during a short\n\
    break in their relationship yet nonetheless chose to sign the birth\n\
    registration papers and act in the role of the child\xE2\x80\x99s father, Turney\n\
    exposes a range of scenarios where the word\xE2\x80\x9Dfraud\" poorly describe what\n\
    the men involved describe as the problem they face, if indeed they\n\
    define their situation as problematic at all. For one man, the issue was\n\
    that his partner was unfaithful, not that the resulting child wasn\xE2\x80\x99t\n\
    biologically \xE2\x80\x9Chis\xE2\x80\x9D. However, in explaining his refusal to have a\n\
    paternity test, the ex-partner of another woman said that while he was\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cover the fact the [she had] slept with some else,\xE2\x80\x9D he hadn\xE2\x80\x99t come to\n\
    terms with the potential genetic consequences of her actions.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Indeed, Turney\xE2\x80\x99s revelation that some men know there are doubts about\n\
    their children\xE2\x80\x99s genetic lineage or even that their children are\n\
    definitely not biologically \xE2\x80\x9Ctheirs\xE2\x80\x9D bolsters suggestions &ndash; rife in the\n\
    academic literature &ndash; that relationship breakdown is an important\n\
    trigger to men\xE2\x80\x99s (and consequently society\xE2\x80\x99s) reworking of paternity\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Csecrets\xE2\x80\x9D into the moral crime of paternity \xE2\x80\x9Cfraud.\xE2\x80\x9D It also hints at\n\
    the unsavory possibility, vehemently rejected by Father\xE2\x80\x99s Rights groups,\n\
    that at least some men are motivated to test &ndash; in the wake of marital\n\
    breakdown &ndash; to escape child support liabilities.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The take home message of Turney\xE2\x80\x99s research is simple, yet consistently\n\
    overlooked in debates about paternity fraud. That human values, motives\n\
    and relationships come in a myriad of complex &ndash; even convoluted &ndash; forms.\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9COh, what a tangled web we weave\xE2\x80\x9D, I wanted to sigh as each woman\xE2\x80\x99s tale\n\
    &ndash; with its coercion and choice, misunderstanding and deception, care and\n\
    indifference &ndash; unfolded. I also found Turney\xE2\x80\x99s work suggestive of a\n\
    number of ways the problem of paternity fraud could be understood, and\n\
    fixed.</p>\n\n\
    <p>What is clear is that it is a nonsense to brand all instances in which\n\
    men receive paternity test results showing they are not a child\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    biological father as cases of \xE2\x80\x9Cpaternity fraud\xE2\x80\x9D. As Turney\xE2\x80\x99s research\n\
    shows, such results may &ndash; or may not &ndash; be telling the man something he\n\
    didn\xE2\x80\x99t know already. Fraud implies deceit and if men know there is doubt\n\
    about a child\xE2\x80\x99s genetic paternity or are sure a child is not their\n\
    biological progeny &ndash; and have supported the pregnancy continuing (for\n\
    instance, by opposing an abortion) &ndash; then it is simply incorrect to\n\
    claim that they have duped either about their partner\xE2\x80\x99s fidelity or into\n\
    accepting legal responsibility for the child.</p>\n\n\
    <p>By definition, a victim of fraud is someone who has been injured, or at\n\
    least disadvantaged. To be defrauded is to be cheated of something that\n\
    is rightfully yours. Indeed, the claim that \xE2\x80\x9Creal\xE2\x80\x9D Dads are genetic\n\
    ones, and therefore that men who discover they are not the progenitor of\n\
    the child they are parenting have been cheated of fatherhood, is at the\n\
    heart of Father\xE2\x80\x99s Rights Groups claims about the wrongs suffered by\n\
    victims of paternity fraud. Yet, research evidence, not to mention the\n\
    decisions of millions of men to adopt children or conceive them using\n\
    donor sperm, suggest that many men see the essence of fatherhood as\n\
    parenting, not sperm-donation. For them, the \xE2\x80\x9Creal\xE2\x80\x9D father is the one\n\
    who is \xE2\x80\x9Cthere\xE2\x80\x9D not at the time of conception, but for the joys and hard\n\
    work of parenting.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Of course, many &ndash; if not most &ndash; men want to be both the genetic and the\n\
    social father of their child. Were this not the case, chastity belts\n\
    would never have been invented, nor the debilitating laws and attitudes\n\
    that until recently condemned \xE2\x80\x9Cunwed mothers\xE2\x80\x9D and their \xE2\x80\x9Cbastard\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    children to legal and social non-personhood. When women keep paternity\n\
    secrets, they deprive men of the knowledge that would instigate an\n\
    exploration of their values regarding social and genetic fatherhood, and\n\
    the chance to make partnering and parenting choices based on those\n\
    values. Paternity secrets deprive men of the chance to say \xE2\x80\x9Cthanks but\n\
    no thanks\xE2\x80\x9D to an offer of social, but not biological, fatherhood.</p>\n\n\
    <p>All this cashes out to a definition of the problem that focuses on the\n\
    abuse of trust caused by infidelity and subsequent deception about the\n\
    infidelity, and the consequent denial to men of the chance to make\n\
    informed decisions about partnering and parenting. Such a definition\n\
    does not make the parenting of an unrelated child a quandary in and of\n\
    itself, but only one in the context of a lack of female honesty and\n\
    informed decision-making by the man. The difficulty is not the return of\n\
    DNA results that show a social father is not a biological one, but the\n\
    return of such results to a man who did not know there was any doubt\n\
    about his partner\xE2\x80\x99s sexual fidelity and his genetic paternity. The\n\
    trouble is the discrepancy between what men believe is the case about\n\
    their partner\xE2\x80\x99s fidelity and genetic paternity, and the reality. The\n\
    problem isn\xE2\x80\x99t paternity fraud. The problem is paternal discrepancy.</p>\n\n\
    <p>What all this should make clear is that the current child support\n\
    payment system, which assigns payment obligations on the basis of\n\
    biological paternity, not parenting commitment, is tragically flawed.\n\
    Regardless of whether or not he suspected, knew or had no idea that the\n\
    child he was parenting was genetically unrelated, and notwithstanding\n\
    however culpable his female partner\xE2\x80\x99s behavior was in creating that\n\
    situation, the law needs to recognize and affirm men\xE2\x80\x99s value to children\n\
    as parents &ndash; and people &ndash; not sperm donors. Playing the biological card\n\
    not only undercuts research findings that affirm the importance to\n\
    children of having an active male parent in their lives, but lends\n\
    support to the insulting claim made by a sperm donor interviewed on Four\n\
    Corners last month that he, not the man who invested 20 years of time\n\
    and love, was his daughter\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Creal\xE2\x80\x9D father.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Ditto for recent suggestions that DNA paternity testing ought to be made\n\
    compulsory at birth. Turney\xE2\x80\x99s research makes it easy to imagine the man\n\
    who suspects or even knows that his new bundle of joy is not a\n\
    biological relation compelled to face a doctor or nurse delivering the\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cnegative\xE2\x80\x9D results of a mandatory paternity test. How likely is such a\n\
    man to admit to knowing and not caring about the sexual and biological\n\
    realities surrounding his child\xE2\x80\x99s conception if he feels this will brand\n\
    him as cuckold and a mug? Better, he may feel, to beat his chest, cry\n\
    foul and walk out on his wife and new baby.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Of course, rejecting mandatory paternity testing at birth does not mean\n\
    that men should not be assisted to accept the obligations of fatherhood\n\
    in a more informed way. Upon the birth of a child, men ought to be given\n\
    the opportunity to give one-time-only non-rescindable consent to their\n\
    acceptance of the rights and responsibilities of fatherhood. If they\n\
    feel unable to sign on the dotted line without conclusive proof that\n\
    they are the biological progenitor, they should be offered a DNA test\n\
    free of charge.</p>\n\n\
    <p>However, once a man does formally accept social and legal responsibility\n\
    for a child &ndash; either with knowledge of their genetic paternity or in the\n\
    face of a fully informed waiver of that knowledge &ndash; their status as the\n\
    child\xE2\x80\x99s legal father should rightly be set in stone. No DNA skeletons\n\
    rattling out of the cupboards at a later date should impact on what they\n\
    legally owe their child, or hopefully, how they feel about the kid who\n\
    calls him Dad.</p>\n\n\

  content: "\xE2\x80\x9CPaternity Fraud\xE2\x80\x9D implies deceptive women cuckholding men into believing\r\n\
    children are biologically theirs. But the truth is more complex, and\r\n\
    more human.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    While the DNA paternity test has been around since the early 1980s, it\r\n\
    was not until the mid\xE2\x80\x931990s that the moral panic about what father\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    rights activists call \xE2\x80\x9Cpaternity fraud\xE2\x80\x9D took flight in Australia.\r\n\
    Instigated by the Child Support (Assessment) Act of 1989, the Act\r\n\
    effectively transformed the age-old definition of a father: from the man\r\n\
    married to a child\xE2\x80\x99s biological mother, to the man whose sperm caused\r\n\
    the child to be conceived. Designed to compel men to take fiscal\r\n\
    responsibility for the fruit of their loins, the new law was lauded by\r\n\
    politicians as a boon to both women and children.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Overnight, the new law changed the world for separated and divorced men.\r\n\
    While previous support arrangements had largely left such men in control\r\n\
    of decisions about whether and to what extent they would provide\r\n\
    financial support for the children of failed relationships ~~60% to 70%\r\n\
    found it easy to evade court-ordered maintenance and pay nothing~~ the\r\n\
    new act used set formulas to assign child support liabilities that could\r\n\
    be automatically deducted from a man\xE2\x80\x99s salary or from his bank account.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The only recourse for men hoping to escape what one commentator\r\n\
    sympathetic to the Father\xE2\x80\x99s Rights cause recently referred to as the\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cclutches\xE2\x80\x9D of the Child Support Agency is to disprove biological\r\n\
    paternity. So, perhaps not surprisingly, the Act\xE2\x80\x99s passage saw DNA labs\r\n\
    bloom across the commercial landscape like desert flowers, marketing\r\n\
    paternal anxiety to men and promising \xE2\x80\x9Cpeace of mind\xE2\x80\x9D from between $150\r\n\
    to $825 (if you want the results to stand up in court). By early 2000,\r\n\
    Father\xE2\x80\x99s Rights Groups were insisting on the basis of discredited or\r\n\
    even non-existent data sets that between 10 to 30% of Australian\r\n\
    children were being parented by men who were not the biological father,\r\n\
    and viciously attacking academics - like Swinburne\xE2\x80\x99s Professor Michael\r\n\
    Gilding - who tried to set the record straight (Gilding\xE2\x80\x99s published\r\n\
    results showing the Australian rate is likely to be between 1 and 3%).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The Australian face of paternity fraud is Melbourne man Liam Magill. In\r\n\
    2002, Magill\xE2\x80\x99s ex-wife Meredith was ordered to pay him $70,000 for\r\n\
    general damages and the economic loss he suffered as a consequence of\r\n\
    her false declaration that he was, as one newspaper report put it, the\r\n\
    biological father of \xE2\x80\x9Cher lover\xE2\x80\x99s children\xE2\x80\x9D. The case continues to fight\r\n\
    its way through the courts, with the High Court of Australia last week\r\n\
    granting Mr Magill leave to contest the Victorian Supreme Court\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    reversal of his victory and continue his case for compensation. But,\r\n\
    however the highest court in the land ultimately rules, Magill\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    predicament - and the anxieties of fathers over legally intertwined\r\n\
    questions of biological paternity and fiscal responsibility - have had a\r\n\
    profound impact on government policy. In June this year, the\r\n\
    Attorney-General Philip Ruddock amended the Family Law Act to make it\r\n\
    easier for men to reclaim child maintenance or property transferred to a\r\n\
    child that DNA testing reveals isn\xE2\x80\x99t really \xE2\x80\x9Ctheirs\xE2\x80\x9D. Around the same\r\n\
    time, the Government took delivery of what has become known as the\r\n\
    Parkinson report which recommends that men disputing biological\r\n\
    paternity be allowed to suspend child support payments for as long as it\r\n\
    takes to resolve the issue.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It is men - or what President of the Australian Law Reform Commission\r\n\
    Professor David Weisbrot calls \xE2\x80\x9Cputative\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cangry dads\xE2\x80\x99 - that\r\n\
    dominate debates about child support and paternity fraud. While their\r\n\
    bitter denunciations of women who\xE2\x80\x9Dcheat and lie\" echo through\r\n\
    cyber-space, in real life such men contribute the bulk of submissions to\r\n\
    the ALRC\xE2\x80\x99s recent inquiry into the privacy of genetic information and,\r\n\
    through their endless complaints to local MPs, instigate inquires like\r\n\
    the 2003 one into child custody arrangements that ultimately led to the\r\n\
    Parkinson report. The voices of children and women are rarely heard.\r\n\
    Indeed, even in the wake of her victory in the Victorian Supreme Court,\r\n\
    Meredith Magill refused to grant interviews to any of the assembled\r\n\
    reporters.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The work of Dr Lyn Turney, a researcher at Swinburne, suggests that this\r\n\
    is not surprising. Turney\xE2\x80\x99s groundbreaking research on women who keep\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cpaternity secrets,\xE2\x80\x9D which appeared in the most recent issue of the\r\n\
    Journal of Family Studies, argues that the panic surrounding paternity\r\n\
    fraud paints mothers as the central \xE2\x80\x9Cmoral threat\xE2\x80\x9D to social stability.\r\n\
    Charged as sexual deviants for the dual \xE2\x80\x9Ccrimes\xE2\x80\x9D of infidelity and\r\n\
    sluttishly having more than one partner - while posing in the community\r\n\
    as \xE2\x80\x9Cgood\xE2\x80\x9D wives and mothers - the behaviour of such women is depicted as\r\n\
    morally indefensible. Says Turney: \xE2\x80\x9CThey encapsulate not only female\r\n\
    sexuality out of control but also a view of women as predatory,\r\n\
    deceptive, and instrumental\xE2\x80\x9D. No wonder they don\xE2\x80\x99t want to stick their\r\n\
    heads above the parapet.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But Turney wanted to know more. In particular, what led women to have\r\n\
    and to keep \xE2\x80\x9Cpaternity secrets\xE2\x80\x9D? Her results, the outcome of interviews\r\n\
    with 15 Australian women, are testament to the stubborn opacity of\r\n\
    conception, the complexity of human relationships and the way in which\r\n\
    both shame and violence shape women\xE2\x80\x99s sexual and reproductive lives.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    As it turns out, Kathleen Donnelly, the past girlfriend of Health\r\n\
    Minister Tony Abbott who publicly - and mistakenly - declared him the\r\n\
    father of their long-ago adopted son, is not the only Australian woman\r\n\
    to be confused about the genetic paternity of her offspring. In Turney\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    sample, a number of women admitted to uncertainty about which man was\r\n\
    the genetic father of their child.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But few of these women\xE2\x80\x99s stories conformed to the \xE2\x80\x9Cpaternity fraud\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    stereotype of faithless wives with regular lovers. Instead, the women\r\n\
    Turney interviewed told of sexual relationships that \xE2\x80\x9Coverlapped\xE2\x80\x9D or\r\n\
    happened \xE2\x80\x9Cin quick succession,\xE2\x80\x9D as well as \xE2\x80\x9Cone-off\xE2\x80\x9D encounters with\r\n\
    friends, acquaintance and old-flames that usually didn\xE2\x80\x99t involve either\r\n\
    infidelity or deception because the women were either unattached or only\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cminimally attached\xE2\x80\x9D to a dying, old or embryonic relationship at the\r\n\
    time. One woman, for example, had unplanned sex with a long-time friend:\r\n\
    her first encounter after the death of her husband a year earlier.\r\n\
    Several days later, she met a new man who became her regular partner.\r\n\
    Another woman told of a single sexual liaison with an old flame while\r\n\
    single and trying to conceive a child with a known-donor. Both of these\r\n\
    women, as well as others to whom Turney spoke, had dismissed the\r\n\
    reproductive potential of these one-off encounters because they wanted\r\n\
    to believe that their chosen or permanent partner - the one with whom\r\n\
    they were having regular unprotected sex - was the genetic father. It\r\n\
    was only when the baby bore a similarity to the biological father at\r\n\
    birth, or the woman later happened upon a childhood photograph of the\r\n\
    biological father, that the connection was made and the biological\r\n\
    realities of the situation accepted.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The threat of sexual violence or shaming also explains a number of cases\r\n\
    of \xE2\x80\x9Cpaternity fraud\xE2\x80\x9D. Several women, some of whom confessed\r\n\
    stomach-turning tales of rape and abuse, withheld doubts about their\r\n\
    child\xE2\x80\x99s paternity for fear of their partners\xE2\x80\x99 response. One woman told\r\n\
    of being raped by a family friend and, believing herself to be at fault\r\n\
    because she \xE2\x80\x9Ctrusted him\xE2\x80\x9D, never told anyone of the assault or her\r\n\
    subsequent doubts about paternity.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Turney also cites several instances where older domineering husbands\r\n\
    organized sexual liaisons - in the context of an \xE2\x80\x9Copen marriage\xE2\x80\x9D and\r\n\
    plenty of drugs and alcohol - in which their wives participated. When\r\n\
    the women subsequently raised questions about the paternity of resulting\r\n\
    children, the husbands \xE2\x80\x9Cmuted\xE2\x80\x9D the discussion by \xE2\x80\x9Chighlighting the\r\n\
    women\xE2\x80\x99s\xE2\x80\xA6sexual transgressions\xE2\x80\x9D and threatening them with public\r\n\
    disclosure. Such men \xE2\x80\x9Cdrew upon the moral panic,\xE2\x80\x9D in other words, to\r\n\
    stop the woman revealing the secret about the child\xE2\x80\x99s paternity not to\r\n\
    the social father - who knew exactly what was going on - but to society\r\n\
    at large. Only when the relationship broke down, and the question of\r\n\
    support payments arose, did the men question the child\xE2\x80\x99s biological\r\n\
    paternity.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Abortion was considered by several women unsure about which man caused\r\n\
    their pregnancy, but the men in their lives were not always supportive.\r\n\
    The Catholic step-father of a 16 year-old told her he would never speak\r\n\
    to her again if she had an abortion, while a GP to whom another woman\r\n\
    confessed her lack of paternity certainty counselled her to \xE2\x80\x9Cgo ahead\r\n\
    with the pregnancy and see what happens\xE2\x80\x9D. In one instance, the\r\n\
    suggestion of abortion triggered an angry response from the woman\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    partner because she was threatening to \xE2\x80\x9Ckill [a] baby that was probably\r\n\
    his\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The knowledge that some \xE2\x80\x9Cdefrauded\xE2\x80\x9D dads have about women\xE2\x80\x99s paternity\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Csecrets\xE2\x80\x99 is perhaps the most important - and surprising - of Turney\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    findings. From the wife-swapping husband, to the abortion-opposing\r\n\
    partner, to the spouse who knew his wife had conceived during a short\r\n\
    break in their relationship yet nonetheless chose to sign the birth\r\n\
    registration papers and act in the role of the child\xE2\x80\x99s father, Turney\r\n\
    exposes a range of scenarios where the word\xE2\x80\x9Dfraud\" poorly describe what\r\n\
    the men involved describe as the problem they face, if indeed they\r\n\
    define their situation as problematic at all. For one man, the issue was\r\n\
    that his partner was unfaithful, not that the resulting child wasn\xE2\x80\x99t\r\n\
    biologically \xE2\x80\x9Chis\xE2\x80\x9D. However, in explaining his refusal to have a\r\n\
    paternity test, the ex-partner of another woman said that while he was\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cover the fact the [she had] slept with some else,\xE2\x80\x9D he hadn\xE2\x80\x99t come to\r\n\
    terms with the potential genetic consequences of her actions.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Indeed, Turney\xE2\x80\x99s revelation that some men know there are doubts about\r\n\
    their children\xE2\x80\x99s genetic lineage or even that their children are\r\n\
    definitely not biologically \xE2\x80\x9Ctheirs\xE2\x80\x9D bolsters suggestions - rife in the\r\n\
    academic literature - that relationship breakdown is an important\r\n\
    trigger to men\xE2\x80\x99s (and consequently society\xE2\x80\x99s) reworking of paternity\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Csecrets\xE2\x80\x9D into the moral crime of paternity \xE2\x80\x9Cfraud.\xE2\x80\x9D It also hints at\r\n\
    the unsavory possibility, vehemently rejected by Father\xE2\x80\x99s Rights groups,\r\n\
    that at least some men are motivated to test - in the wake of marital\r\n\
    breakdown - to escape child support liabilities.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The take home message of Turney\xE2\x80\x99s research is simple, yet consistently\r\n\
    overlooked in debates about paternity fraud. That human values, motives\r\n\
    and relationships come in a myriad of complex - even convoluted - forms.\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9COh, what a tangled web we weave\xE2\x80\x9D, I wanted to sigh as each woman\xE2\x80\x99s tale\r\n\
    - with its coercion and choice, misunderstanding and deception, care and\r\n\
    indifference - unfolded. I also found Turney\xE2\x80\x99s work suggestive of a\r\n\
    number of ways the problem of paternity fraud could be understood, and\r\n\
    fixed.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    What is clear is that it is a nonsense to brand all instances in which\r\n\
    men receive paternity test results showing they are not a child\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    biological father as cases of \xE2\x80\x9Cpaternity fraud\xE2\x80\x9D. As Turney\xE2\x80\x99s research\r\n\
    shows, such results may - or may not - be telling the man something he\r\n\
    didn\xE2\x80\x99t know already. Fraud implies deceit and if men know there is doubt\r\n\
    about a child\xE2\x80\x99s genetic paternity or are sure a child is not their\r\n\
    biological progeny - and have supported the pregnancy continuing (for\r\n\
    instance, by opposing an abortion) - then it is simply incorrect to\r\n\
    claim that they have duped either about their partner\xE2\x80\x99s fidelity or into\r\n\
    accepting legal responsibility for the child.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    By definition, a victim of fraud is someone who has been injured, or at\r\n\
    least disadvantaged. To be defrauded is to be cheated of something that\r\n\
    is rightfully yours. Indeed, the claim that \xE2\x80\x9Creal\xE2\x80\x9D Dads are genetic\r\n\
    ones, and therefore that men who discover they are not the progenitor of\r\n\
    the child they are parenting have been cheated of fatherhood, is at the\r\n\
    heart of Father\xE2\x80\x99s Rights Groups claims about the wrongs suffered by\r\n\
    victims of paternity fraud. Yet, research evidence, not to mention the\r\n\
    decisions of millions of men to adopt children or conceive them using\r\n\
    donor sperm, suggest that many men see the essence of fatherhood as\r\n\
    parenting, not sperm-donation. For them, the \xE2\x80\x9Creal\xE2\x80\x9D father is the one\r\n\
    who is \xE2\x80\x9Cthere\xE2\x80\x9D not at the time of conception, but for the joys and hard\r\n\
    work of parenting.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Of course, many - if not most - men want to be both the genetic and the\r\n\
    social father of their child. Were this not the case, chastity belts\r\n\
    would never have been invented, nor the debilitating laws and attitudes\r\n\
    that until recently condemned \xE2\x80\x9Cunwed mothers\xE2\x80\x9D and their \xE2\x80\x9Cbastard\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    children to legal and social non-personhood. When women keep paternity\r\n\
    secrets, they deprive men of the knowledge that would instigate an\r\n\
    exploration of their values regarding social and genetic fatherhood, and\r\n\
    the chance to make partnering and parenting choices based on those\r\n\
    values. Paternity secrets deprive men of the chance to say \xE2\x80\x9Cthanks but\r\n\
    no thanks\xE2\x80\x9D to an offer of social, but not biological, fatherhood.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    All this cashes out to a definition of the problem that focuses on the\r\n\
    abuse of trust caused by infidelity and subsequent deception about the\r\n\
    infidelity, and the consequent denial to men of the chance to make\r\n\
    informed decisions about partnering and parenting. Such a definition\r\n\
    does not make the parenting of an unrelated child a quandary in and of\r\n\
    itself, but only one in the context of a lack of female honesty and\r\n\
    informed decision-making by the man. The difficulty is not the return of\r\n\
    DNA results that show a social father is not a biological one, but the\r\n\
    return of such results to a man who did not know there was any doubt\r\n\
    about his partner\xE2\x80\x99s sexual fidelity and his genetic paternity. The\r\n\
    trouble is the discrepancy between what men believe is the case about\r\n\
    their partner\xE2\x80\x99s fidelity and genetic paternity, and the reality. The\r\n\
    problem isn\xE2\x80\x99t paternity fraud. The problem is paternal discrepancy.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    What all this should make clear is that the current child support\r\n\
    payment system, which assigns payment obligations on the basis of\r\n\
    biological paternity, not parenting commitment, is tragically flawed.\r\n\
    Regardless of whether or not he suspected, knew or had no idea that the\r\n\
    child he was parenting was genetically unrelated, and notwithstanding\r\n\
    however culpable his female partner\xE2\x80\x99s behavior was in creating that\r\n\
    situation, the law needs to recognize and affirm men\xE2\x80\x99s value to children\r\n\
    as parents - and people - not sperm donors. Playing the biological card\r\n\
    not only undercuts research findings that affirm the importance to\r\n\
    children of having an active male parent in their lives, but lends\r\n\
    support to the insulting claim made by a sperm donor interviewed on Four\r\n\
    Corners last month that he, not the man who invested 20 years of time\r\n\
    and love, was his daughter\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Creal\xE2\x80\x9D father.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Ditto for recent suggestions that DNA paternity testing ought to be made\r\n\
    compulsory at birth. Turney\xE2\x80\x99s research makes it easy to imagine the man\r\n\
    who suspects or even knows that his new bundle of joy is not a\r\n\
    biological relation compelled to face a doctor or nurse delivering the\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cnegative\xE2\x80\x9D results of a mandatory paternity test. How likely is such a\r\n\
    man to admit to knowing and not caring about the sexual and biological\r\n\
    realities surrounding his child\xE2\x80\x99s conception if he feels this will brand\r\n\
    him as cuckold and a mug? Better, he may feel, to beat his chest, cry\r\n\
    foul and walk out on his wife and new baby.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Of course, rejecting mandatory paternity testing at birth does not mean\r\n\
    that men should not be assisted to accept the obligations of fatherhood\r\n\
    in a more informed way. Upon the birth of a child, men ought to be given\r\n\
    the opportunity to give one-time-only non-rescindable consent to their\r\n\
    acceptance of the rights and responsibilities of fatherhood. If they\r\n\
    feel unable to sign on the dotted line without conclusive proof that\r\n\
    they are the biological progenitor, they should be offered a DNA test\r\n\
    free of charge.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    However, once a man does formally accept social and legal responsibility\r\n\
    for a child - either with knowledge of their genetic paternity or in the\r\n\
    face of a fully informed waiver of that knowledge - their status as the\r\n\
    child\xE2\x80\x99s legal father should rightly be set in stone. No DNA skeletons\r\n\
    rattling out of the cupboards at a later date should impact on what they\r\n\
    legally owe their child, or hopefully, how they feel about the kid who\r\n\
    calls him Dad.\r\n\

    <p>TEASE: Motherhood is the latest in a long line of cri de coeur books by\n\
    baby-boom women about what is claimed to be the incompatibility of\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cfeminist\xE2\x80\x9D ideas about motherhood and female emancipation and their\n\
    lived experience of motherhood. Like Manne, such authors breathed\n\
    feminist assumptions &ndash; about the equality of men\xE2\x80\x99s and women\xE2\x80\x99s talents,\n\
    women\xE2\x80\x99s need for economic independence and human flourishing &ndash; \xE2\x80\x9Cas\n\
    naturally as air\xE2\x80\x9D. But when their children are born, such women find\n\
    they conflict with the way they want to mother (or as Manne prefers, the\n\
    way children need them to mother).</p>\n\n\
    <p>At the heart of Motherhood\xE2\x80\x99s claim to know what children really need and\n\
    what therefore, according to the logic of such texts, mothers are\n\
    morally compelled to provide is Manne\xE2\x80\x99s preternatural insight into the\n\
    emotional life of pre-verbal children: her own and other women\xE2\x80\x99s.\n\
    Motherhood is replete with anecdotes about the mothers that breezily\n\
    assert the acceptability of their care arrangements when Manne &ndash; having\n\
    sized the situation up in less than a minute &ndash; knows better. \xE2\x80\x9COne\n\
    friend\xE2\x80\x9D, she reveals, \xE2\x80\x9Cput her baby into full-time care when the baby\n\
    was nine months old. Meeting me in the street, she anxiously assured me\n\
    that the baby was `quite happy\xE2\x80\x99 in care. But the baby told a different\n\
    story. When the caregiver\xE2\x80\x99s name was mentioned, she put her arms around\n\
    her mother\xE2\x80\x99s neck, and with look of indescribable sadness, laid her head\n\
    down on her mother\xE2\x80\x99s shoulder.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Manne offers \xE2\x80\x9Cmaternal feminism\xE2\x80\x9D as a cutting-edge framework for\n\
    resolving these issues rather than a theoretical relic of the 1980s\n\
    impossibly encumbered by the same problems of regressive essentialism\n\
    that plague Motherhood. Indeed, the book\xE2\x80\x99s key take-home message is that\n\
    the relationship between mothers and babies can not be \xE2\x80\x9Creplaced\xE2\x80\x9D by\n\
    paternal or other sorts of care. Perhaps because even the selective\n\
    reporting of research findings that she uses to such great effect\n\
    elsewhere won\xE2\x80\x99t work to support this claim, Manne relies on anecdote and\n\
    the views of a famous Australian cartoonist, to make her case. She tells\n\
    of arriving home early from the library to hear her daughter crying: \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x9DI\n\
    rushed in to find my husband\xE2\x80\xA6trying to soothe her. When I picked her up\n\
    she turned her head towards my shoulder. She took a long, deep,\n\
    suspicious sniff, turned her head to one side, smiled and fell asleep.\n\
    She smelt her mother.\"</p>\n\n\
    <p>Having approvingly cited Leunig\xE2\x80\x99s take on attachment theory, Manne\n\
    somewhat incoherently presents an anecdote about the inadequacies of\n\
    grandparental to make her case against institutional childcare: \xE2\x80\x9CA\n\
    perceptive grandmother, an exceptionally sensitive caregiver, who looked\n\
    after her two little grandchildren full-time while the mother worked,\n\
    once told of the oldest stopping deal in the middle of play and suddenly\n\
    crying out for her mother\xE2\x80\x99s face. `Where\xE2\x80\x99s that dear face? Where is\n\
    it?\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>It is worth pausing here to ask some questions about the implied moral\n\
    of this story: that if a child ever misses her Mum the mother\xE2\x80\x99s absence\n\
    is wronging the child and must be remedied. Is the pain of missing a\n\
    beloved other than a mother good enough reason to change care\n\
    arrangements too? Some babies cry whenever their mothers step into the\n\
    shower, or attempt to go to the toilet or the doctor alone. Must good\n\
    mothers abandon such solitary journeys? If the baby misses Dad at work\n\
    or a sibling at school, must they also be tethered to home? Indeed, if\n\
    we ignore the implications of Manne\xE2\x80\x99s arguments and accept her claim to\n\
    believe in the capacity of children to attach to both their fathers and\n\
    mothers, doesn\xE2\x80\x99t the \xE2\x80\x9Cmissing as tragedy\xE2\x80\x9D argument imply that what\n\
    children need is 24/7 access to both parents?</p>\n\n\
    <p>But absent scholarship and faulty logic are only some of the problems\n\
    plaguing Motherhood. The others reduce to honesty and integrity.\n\
    Motherhood is a polemic that has nothing to do with \xE2\x80\x9Cmoving beyond the\n\
    motherwars\xE2\x80\x9D, and everything to do with championing the at-home mother as\n\
    the good one. Her advice to women confronting work/life dilemmas? You\n\
    can have it all, but \xE2\x80\x9Cin sequence\xE2\x80\x9D, not \xE2\x80\x9Call at once\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>More disturbingly, Manne mischaracterizes key thinkers and important\n\
    debates. She claims that feminist Eva Cox said at-home mothers raise\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cnarcissistic monsters incapable of sharing\xE2\x80\x9D, when a quick internet trip\n\
    to the Boyer lectures reveals the complete lack of fit between this\n\
    description and Cox\xE2\x80\x99s far more temperate point. Manne asserts that a\n\
    2002 study by a university student claiming bad outcomes for small\n\
    children spending long hours in daycare was \xE2\x80\x9Cattacked on every media\n\
    outlet\xE2\x80\x9D. However, a review of the print media during this period reveals\n\
    that while news items were either slanted in favour of the study or were\n\
    balanced, 7 of the 8 opinion pieces lavishly praised the study and\n\
    castigated its mythical critics. The one exception was a piece by the\n\
    head of the Australian Institute of Family Studies refuting the claims\n\
    of columnist Bettina Arndt that because one of his expert staff\n\
    questioned the validity of the study\xE2\x80\x99s methodology, she and the entire\n\
    Institute were guilty of left-wing bias.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The publication of Motherhood will ensure Manne\xE2\x80\x99s views continue to\n\
    feature in debates on work/life balance and childcare. We can only hope\n\
    it influence the weight and credibility they are accorded as well.</p>\n"

    sized the situation up in less than a minute - knows better. \xE2\x80\x9COne\r\n\
    friend\xE2\x80\x9D, she reveals, \xE2\x80\x9Cput her baby into full-time care when the baby\r\n\
    was nine months old. Meeting me in the street, she anxiously assured me\r\n\
    that the baby was \\`quite happy\xE2\x80\x99 in care. But the baby told a different\r\n\
    story. When the caregiver\xE2\x80\x99s name was mentioned, she put her arms around\r\n\
    her mother\xE2\x80\x99s neck, and with look of indescribable sadness, laid her head\r\n\
    down on her mother\xE2\x80\x99s shoulder.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Manne offers \xE2\x80\x9Cmaternal feminism\xE2\x80\x9D as a cutting-edge framework for\r\n\
    resolving these issues rather than a theoretical relic of the 1980s\r\n\
    impossibly encumbered by the same problems of regressive essentialism\r\n\
    that plague Motherhood. Indeed, the book\xE2\x80\x99s key take-home message is that\r\n\
    the relationship between mothers and babies can not be \xE2\x80\x9Creplaced\xE2\x80\x9D by\r\n\
    paternal or other sorts of care. Perhaps because even the selective\r\n\
    reporting of research findings that she uses to such great effect\r\n\
    elsewhere won\xE2\x80\x99t work to support this claim, Manne relies on anecdote and\r\n\
    the views of a famous Australian cartoonist, to make her case. She tells\r\n\
    of arriving home early from the library to hear her daughter crying: \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x9DI\r\n\
    rushed in to find my husband\xE2\x80\xA6trying to soothe her. When I picked her up\r\n\
    she turned her head towards my shoulder. She took a long, deep,\r\n\
    suspicious sniff, turned her head to one side, smiled and fell asleep.\r\n\
    She smelt her mother.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Having approvingly cited Leunig\xE2\x80\x99s take on attachment theory, Manne\r\n\
    somewhat incoherently presents an anecdote about the inadequacies of\r\n\
    grandparental to make her case against institutional childcare: \xE2\x80\x9CA\r\n\
    perceptive grandmother, an exceptionally sensitive caregiver, who looked\r\n\
    after her two little grandchildren full-time while the mother worked,\r\n\
    once told of the oldest stopping deal in the middle of play and suddenly\r\n\
    crying out for her mother\xE2\x80\x99s face. \\`Where\xE2\x80\x99s that dear face? Where is\r\n\
    it?\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It is worth pausing here to ask some questions about the implied moral\r\n\
    of this story: that if a child ever misses her Mum the mother\xE2\x80\x99s absence\r\n\
    is wronging the child and must be remedied. Is the pain of missing a\r\n\
    beloved other than a mother good enough reason to change care\r\n\
    arrangements too? Some babies cry whenever their mothers step into the\r\n\
    shower, or attempt to go to the toilet or the doctor alone. Must good\r\n\
    mothers abandon such solitary journeys? If the baby misses Dad at work\r\n\
    or a sibling at school, must they also be tethered to home? Indeed, if\r\n\
    we ignore the implications of Manne\xE2\x80\x99s arguments and accept her claim to\r\n\
    believe in the capacity of children to attach to both their fathers and\r\n\
    mothers, doesn\xE2\x80\x99t the \xE2\x80\x9Cmissing as tragedy\xE2\x80\x9D argument imply that what\r\n\
    children need is 24/7 access to both parents?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But absent scholarship and faulty logic are only some of the problems\r\n\
    plaguing Motherhood. The others reduce to honesty and integrity.\r\n\
    Motherhood is a polemic that has nothing to do with \xE2\x80\x9Cmoving beyond the\r\n\
    motherwars\xE2\x80\x9D, and everything to do with championing the at-home mother as\r\n\
    the good one. Her advice to women confronting work/life dilemmas? You\r\n\
    can have it all, but \xE2\x80\x9Cin sequence\xE2\x80\x9D, not \xE2\x80\x9Call at once\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    More disturbingly, Manne mischaracterizes key thinkers and important\r\n\
    debates. She claims that feminist Eva Cox said at-home mothers raise\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cnarcissistic monsters incapable of sharing\xE2\x80\x9D, when a quick internet trip\r\n\
    to the Boyer lectures reveals the complete lack of fit between this\r\n\
    description and Cox\xE2\x80\x99s far more temperate point. Manne asserts that a\r\n\
    2002 study by a university student claiming bad outcomes for small\r\n\
    children spending long hours in daycare was \xE2\x80\x9Cattacked on every media\r\n\
    outlet\xE2\x80\x9D. However, a review of the print media during this period reveals\r\n\
    that while news items were either slanted in favour of the study or were\r\n\
    balanced, 7 of the 8 opinion pieces lavishly praised the study and\r\n\
    castigated its mythical critics. The one exception was a piece by the\r\n\
    head of the Australian Institute of Family Studies refuting the claims\r\n\
    of columnist Bettina Arndt that because one of his expert staff\r\n\
    questioned the validity of the study\xE2\x80\x99s methodology, she and the entire\r\n\
    Institute were guilty of left-wing bias.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The publication of Motherhood will ensure Manne\xE2\x80\x99s views continue to\r\n\
    feature in debates on work/life balance and childcare. We can only hope\r\n\
    it influence the weight and credibility they are accorded as well."

  content_markup: "<p>TEASE: It\xE2\x80\x99s beginning to look a lot like Christmas, but those who\xE2\x80\x99d\n\
    hoped the giving spirit might have affected the Prime Minister when it\n\
    came to the abortion drug RU 486 have found their stockings sadly empty.\n\
    On Tuesday, the Prime Minister emerged from a Liberal party room meeting\n\
    to inform the media that the vote expected by the end of next week was\n\
    cancelled. The Coalition\xE2\x80\x99s pre-Christmas legislative agenda was crowded\n\
    with issues far more important than women\xE2\x80\x99s health. Those hoping to find\n\
    out whether Australian patients will finally get access to a\n\
    pharmaceutical that doesn\xE2\x80\x99t just terminate very early pregnancies, but\n\
    is used in the treatment of breast cancer and endometriosis, would just\n\
    have to wait.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But the truth is that if the PM had strongly defined what the vote was\n\
    really about &ndash; and insisted the Coalition take a principled stand on the\n\
    issue &ndash; the vote could have been wrapped up in less than an hour. The\n\
    vote was never about abortion, or even the safety or effectiveness of RU\n\
    486. It was about who should decide if RU 486 is safe and effective\n\
    enough to be marketed in Australia: the Health Minister or the\n\
    Therapeutics Goods Administration. This no-brainer of a question is\n\
    essentially one about good governance. How worrying that the Prime\n\
    Minister determined his colleagues needed the entire holiday period to\n\
    consider their answer, and a conscience vote on the issue when they\n\
    return to work 2006.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So how are events likely to play out next year? John Howard has promised\n\
    a conscience vote, but whether it will take place on a Democrats\n\
    amendment to the Therapeutic Goods Act (TGA), or a Private Member\xE2\x80\x99s Bill\n\
    facilitated by the Government, no one can say. All power lies with the\n\
    Prime Minister. If the Government moves its own amendments to the TGA,\n\
    this will give the Democrats the chance to initiate a vote on the ban.\n\
    Alternately, the Government can facilitate a Private Member\xE2\x80\x99s bill\n\
    mooting the necessary changes to the TGA.</p>\n\n\
    <p>A private member\xE2\x80\x99s bill in the new year carries significant risks for\n\
    supporters of women\xE2\x80\x99s health and freedom. Having successfully delayed\n\
    the vote, the large coterie of anti-choice government ministers who\n\
    surround the Prime Minister may now be hoping to convince him that they\n\
    need a private member\xE2\x80\x99s bill, too. Say, one that bans Medicare funding\n\
    for abortion, or mandates that women \xE2\x80\x9Ccool off\xE2\x80\x9D for 2 days before being\n\
    eligible to claim the abortion rebate. If such proposals sound extreme\n\
    or unlikely, guess again. Both have been floated in the last few years\n\
    by prominent members of the Coalition government, and have the support\n\
    of key members of the Labor party.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Supporters of the ban are also pushing the PM to set up an inquiry into\n\
    the drug\xE2\x80\x99s safety. Hmmm, good idea. What about letting the TGA do it?\n\
    Indeed, a research note published this week by the federal parliamentary\n\
    library service, which provides neutral information, analysis and advice\n\
    to MPs, points out that the TGA is precisely the right agency to\n\
    undertake such an evaluation as it is explicitly charged with evaluating\n\
    and managing the risks associated with pharmaceuticals. The note\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    author points out that \xE2\x80\x9CThe TGA is regarded by the government as being\n\
    qualified to manage the risks associated with any therapeutic good that\n\
    is used (or proposed for use) in Australia\xE2\x80\xA6[Why shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t one]\n\
    reasonably assume that it is also qualified to manage the risks\n\
    associated with abortifacients such as RU486\xE2\x80\x9D?</p>\n\n\
    <p>So what can those with a penchant for good governance and a distaste for\n\
    political interference into the private decisions citizens make about\n\
    their lives and health do to restore the integrity of the TGA\xE2\x80\x99s drug\n\
    evaluation framework and to lift the ban on RU486?</p>\n\n\
    <p>The simple answer is to make more noise. The Government\xE2\x80\x99s TGA bill\n\
    remains on their legislative agenda for this parliamentary session. The\n\
    Prime Minister must be urged to bring the bill on and to allow a vote on\n\
    the Democrat\xE2\x80\x99s amendment before the holiday break. And if a Private\n\
    Member\xE2\x80\x99s bill early next year is the best he can do, the unfairness of\n\
    any tit-for-tat offerings to supporters of the ban must be made clear..</p>\n\n\
    <p>Having achieved their aim of delaying the bill, they\xE2\x80\x99ve had their\n\
    Christmas present already.</p>\n"

    really about - and insisted the Coalition take a principled stand on the\r\n\
    issue - the vote could have been wrapped up in less than an hour. The\r\n\
    vote was never about abortion, or even the safety or effectiveness of RU\r\n\
    486. It was about who should decide if RU 486 is safe and effective\r\n\
    enough to be marketed in Australia: the Health Minister or the\r\n\
    Therapeutics Goods Administration. This no-brainer of a question is\r\n\
    essentially one about good governance. How worrying that the Prime\r\n\
    Minister determined his colleagues needed the entire holiday period to\r\n\
    consider their answer, and a conscience vote on the issue when they\r\n\
    return to work 2006.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So how are events likely to play out next year? John Howard has promised\r\n\
    a conscience vote, but whether it will take place on a Democrats\r\n\
    amendment to the Therapeutic Goods Act (TGA), or a Private Member\xE2\x80\x99s Bill\r\n\
    facilitated by the Government, no one can say. All power lies with the\r\n\
    Prime Minister. If the Government moves its own amendments to the TGA,\r\n\
    this will give the Democrats the chance to initiate a vote on the ban.\r\n\
    Alternately, the Government can facilitate a Private Member\xE2\x80\x99s bill\r\n\
    mooting the necessary changes to the TGA.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    A private member\xE2\x80\x99s bill in the new year carries significant risks for\r\n\
    supporters of women\xE2\x80\x99s health and freedom. Having successfully delayed\r\n\
    the vote, the large coterie of anti-choice government ministers who\r\n\
    surround the Prime Minister may now be hoping to convince him that they\r\n\
    need a private member\xE2\x80\x99s bill, too. Say, one that bans Medicare funding\r\n\
    for abortion, or mandates that women \xE2\x80\x9Ccool off\xE2\x80\x9D for 2 days before being\r\n\
    eligible to claim the abortion rebate. If such proposals sound extreme\r\n\
    or unlikely, guess again. Both have been floated in the last few years\r\n\
    by prominent members of the Coalition government, and have the support\r\n\
    of key members of the Labor party.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Supporters of the ban are also pushing the PM to set up an inquiry into\r\n\
    the drug\xE2\x80\x99s safety. Hmmm, good idea. What about letting the TGA do it?\r\n\
    Indeed, a research note published this week by the federal parliamentary\r\n\
    library service, which provides neutral information, analysis and advice\r\n\
    to MPs, points out that the TGA is precisely the right agency to\r\n\
    undertake such an evaluation as it is explicitly charged with evaluating\r\n\
    and managing the risks associated with pharmaceuticals. The note\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    author points out that \xE2\x80\x9CThe TGA is regarded by the government as being\r\n\
    qualified to manage the risks associated with any therapeutic good that\r\n\
    is used (or proposed for use) in Australia\xE2\x80\xA6[Why shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t one]\r\n\
    reasonably assume that it is also qualified to manage the risks\r\n\
    associated with abortifacients such as RU486\xE2\x80\x9D?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So what can those with a penchant for good governance and a distaste for\r\n\
    political interference into the private decisions citizens make about\r\n\
    their lives and health do to restore the integrity of the TGA\xE2\x80\x99s drug\r\n\
    evaluation framework and to lift the ban on RU486?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The simple answer is to make more noise. The Government\xE2\x80\x99s TGA bill\r\n\
    remains on their legislative agenda for this parliamentary session. The\r\n\
    Prime Minister must be urged to bring the bill on and to allow a vote on\r\n\
    the Democrat\xE2\x80\x99s amendment before the holiday break. And if a Private\r\n\
    Member\xE2\x80\x99s bill early next year is the best he can do, the unfairness of\r\n\
    any tit-for-tat offerings to supporters of the ban must be made clear..\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Having achieved their aim of delaying the bill, they\xE2\x80\x99ve had their\r\n\
    Christmas present already."

    amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act that have effectively banned\n\
    RU486 and other abortifacient drugs from Australia, the Bill &ndash; having\n\

    <p>This is a disastrous outcome for those hoping for a quick resolution to\n\

    of the Bill. It is also a blow to those hoping that the passage of the\n\
    unamended Bill would mean that the Therapeutic Goods Administration\n\
    (TGA) would finally get a chance to conduct an impartial and thorough\n\
    evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the medication and &ndash; should\n\
    they give the go ahead &ndash; approve the registration of the drug in\n\
    Australia.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Successful amendment of the Bill in the Lower House could mean\n\
    Australians are in for \xE2\x80\x98the abortion debate that time forgot.\xE2\x80\x99 Indeed,\n\
    this may be the intention of the amendment. A fax sent to all MPs urges\n\
    them to vote for the amendment to ensure an \xE2\x80\x98all-encompassing debate\xE2\x80\x99 on\n\
    the \xE2\x80\x98moral and ethical\xE2\x80\x99 &ndash; as well as the \xE2\x80\x98safety\xE2\x80\x99 &ndash; issues is had this\n\
    time, and every time, the TGA approves such drugs.</p>\n\n\
    <p>MPs who vote for the current amendments will condemn the rest of us to\n\
    weeks, if not months, of further discussion on RU486 because the amended\n\
    Bill must return to the Senate for consideration and a vote. If the\n\
    Senate refuses to accept the amended Bill, the House of Representatives\n\
    can either insist on their amendment or vote to pass the original. If\n\
    they go the former route then the Bill will return to the Senate which\n\
    can either vote to accept the amended one or return the original to the\n\
    House of Represenatatives \xE2\x80\xA6 and on and on it goes.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Indeed, the Bill can become a football, passing back and forth between\n\
    the two Houses until &ndash; unable to reach agreement &ndash; both agree to set it\n\
    aside, meaning that the current untenable situation, where the Health\n\
    Minister decides on drugs like RU486, prevails.</p>\n\n\
    <p>There are both principled and practical problems with the Laming\n\
    amendment. While it allows the TGA to evaluate the drug without prior\n\
    approval of the Minister &ndash; the Parliament would have the power to\n\
    override the TGA\xE2\x80\x99s decision to register the drug. This replicates &ndash;\n\
    indeed multiplies &ndash; the current problem of non-experts making critical\n\
    decisions based on heaven-knows-what information about life-altering and\n\
    life-saving medications.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Liberal MP Danna Vale\xE2\x80\x99s plea to her colleagues to vote against the\n\
    current Bill because the drug\xE2\x80\x99s availability could lead to Australia\n\
    being dominated by Muslims &ndash; a claim not only replete with racist\n\
    overtones but also based on the false assertion that making RU486\n\
    available will increase the abortion rate &ndash; offers an insight into the\n\
    sort of \xE2\x80\x98logic\xE2\x80\x99 that some MPs might apply to decisions about drugs like\n\
    RU486 if given the chance by passing of the amendment.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This principled problem leads to the practical problem already facing\n\
    women and patients desperately seeking access to the drug: no\n\
    pharmaceutical company is willing to go through the expensive and\n\
    time-consuming process of seeking TGA registration for RU486, despite\n\
    reams of high-quality evidence that it is both safe and effective. This\n\
    is because of the uncertainty created by the current arrangements, which\n\
    allow the Minister to veto the TGA\xE2\x80\x99s ruling.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Laming amendment multiplies this uncertainty by allowing the TGA\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    evidence-based decision to be overturned by Parliament and in so doing,\n\
    virtually assures a continued absence of applications by drug companies\n\
    to register and market the drug in Australia.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Indeed, if the amendment passes, this could be the situation not just\n\
    for abortifacient drugs but for all drugs a small, vociferous minority\n\
    deems controversial. The pro-amendment fax states:</p>\n\n\
    <p>RU486 is just the first of many highly controversial drugs which the TGA\n\
    will confront over the next decade \xE2\x80\xA6 The TGA Act 1989 should be amended\n\
    to ensure that any controversial drug is not listed in Australia purely\n\
    because it is safe and effective.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Drug approval by popular opinion, it seems, is just around the corner.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So close, yet so far. It is the face of Mary Lander &ndash; the Australian\n\
    woman diagnosed around this time last year with an inoperable brain\n\
    tumour who is still struggling to import RU486 to treat her condition &ndash;\n\
    that swims before my eyes as I consider the possibility that having\n\
    passed the Senate with such overwhelming support, this Bill may still be\n\
    defeated.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Mary\xE2\x80\x99s face, and faces of the Australian women who &ndash; having made the\n\
    difficult decision to terminate &ndash; are so determined to carry out this\n\
    decision without undergoing surgery and without delay (medical abortion\n\
    using RU486 can be done earlier than surgical abortion) that they hop on\n\
    a plane to New Zealand or the UK to gain access to the drug.</p>\n\n\
    <p>MPs considering the Laming amendment should not kid themselves that it\n\
    represents a reasonable compromise position. In fact, the amendments\n\
    undermine the fundamental intention of the Bill, which is to remove\n\
    medical and scientific decisions from the hands of politicians, and\n\
    place them in the hands of the experts at the TGA.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Yes, RU486 procures early non-surgical abortion, but it also has the\n\
    capacity to save the lives of countless Australians suffering from\n\
    serious diseases. And insofar as MPs believe decisions relating to\n\
    abortion needs to be regulated by politicians, they can rest assured\n\
    that they are. Every State in Australia has criminal or medical\n\
    regulations overseeing abortion and State MPs, like their Federal\n\
    counterparts, come up for regular re-election, too. It has been argued\n\
    more than once that, given the availability of legal abortion in\n\
    Australia, the push by Federal parliamentarians to constrain the\n\
    legitimate role of the TGA is illegitimately interfering with State laws\n\
    and policies.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Supporting the Laming amendment means affirming the dubious principle\n\
    that politicians, rather than medical and scientific experts, are the\n\
    right people to make critical decisions about one particular class of\n\
    drugs. In practice, it means denying Australian women with an unplanned\n\
    and unwanted pregnancy &ndash; and other Australian patients with\n\
    life-threatening tumours and cancers &ndash; ready and affordable access to a\n\
    pharmaceutical that is used safely and legally by millions of patients\n\
    around the globe each year.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Politicians have been afforded a conscience vote on this issue. They\n\
    have a moral obligation to use it to ensure women, in consultation with\n\
    their doctors, get one too.</p>\n"

    will confront over the next decade \xE2\x80\xA6 The TGA Act 1989 should be amended\r\n\
    to ensure that any controversial drug is not listed in Australia purely\r\n\
    because it is safe and effective.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Drug approval by popular opinion, it seems, is just around the corner.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So close, yet so far. It is the face of Mary Lander - the Australian\r\n\
    woman diagnosed around this time last year with an inoperable brain\r\n\
    tumour who is still struggling to import RU486 to treat her condition -\r\n\
    that swims before my eyes as I consider the possibility that having\r\n\
    passed the Senate with such overwhelming support, this Bill may still be\r\n\
    defeated.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Mary\xE2\x80\x99s face, and faces of the Australian women who - having made the\r\n\
    difficult decision to terminate - are so determined to carry out this\r\n\
    decision without undergoing surgery and without delay (medical abortion\r\n\
    using RU486 can be done earlier than surgical abortion) that they hop on\r\n\
    a plane to New Zealand or the UK to gain access to the drug.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    MPs considering the Laming amendment should not kid themselves that it\r\n\
    represents a reasonable compromise position. In fact, the amendments\r\n\
    undermine the fundamental intention of the Bill, which is to remove\r\n\
    medical and scientific decisions from the hands of politicians, and\r\n\
    place them in the hands of the experts at the TGA.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Yes, RU486 procures early non-surgical abortion, but it also has the\r\n\
    capacity to save the lives of countless Australians suffering from\r\n\
    serious diseases. And insofar as MPs believe decisions relating to\r\n\
    abortion needs to be regulated by politicians, they can rest assured\r\n\
    that they are. Every State in Australia has criminal or medical\r\n\
    regulations overseeing abortion and State MPs, like their Federal\r\n\
    counterparts, come up for regular re-election, too. It has been argued\r\n\
    more than once that, given the availability of legal abortion in\r\n\
    Australia, the push by Federal parliamentarians to constrain the\r\n\
    legitimate role of the TGA is illegitimately interfering with State laws\r\n\
    and policies.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Supporting the Laming amendment means affirming the dubious principle\r\n\
    that politicians, rather than medical and scientific experts, are the\r\n\
    right people to make critical decisions about one particular class of\r\n\
    drugs. In practice, it means denying Australian women with an unplanned\r\n\
    and unwanted pregnancy - and other Australian patients with\r\n\
    life-threatening tumours and cancers - ready and affordable access to a\r\n\
    pharmaceutical that is used safely and legally by millions of patients\r\n\
    around the globe each year.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Politicians have been afforded a conscience vote on this issue. They\r\n\
    have a moral obligation to use it to ensure women, in consultation with\r\n\
    their doctors, get one too."

    <p>TEASE: ANYONE who followed the debate on RU486, and understood the\n\
    complex politics surrounding it, knew it was coming: a quid pro quo for\n\
    the Health Minister to soften the blow of losing his powers to deny\n\
    Australian women access to RU486. It came last Thursday: a $51 million\n\
    dollar package for two <a href=\"\">pregnancy support measures</a> a new counselling\n\
    hotline and Medicare rebate. Then came the story of a push in Victoria\n\
    to remove abortion from the Crimes Act.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Counselling is like motherhood: something few want to oppose. But the\n\
    truth is that some counselling isn\xE2\x80\x99t what is seems. Far from improving\n\
    the quality of women\xE2\x80\x99s decisions, mental health or lives, biased\n\
    counselling &ndash; funded by the Commonwealth to the tune of $350,982 &ndash; can\n\
    cause lasting damage to women\xE2\x80\x99s lives and mental health. Sadly, it\n\
    appears that this is precisely the sort of \xE2\x80\x9Ccounselling\xE2\x80\x9D the Federal\n\
    Government has in mind.</p>\n\n\
    <p>There is one key feature that attaches to all legitimate counselling:\n\
    the commitment to fostering a woman\xE2\x80\x99s autonomy. At the heart of all\n\
    ethical medical practice, you will find the key value of autonomy, the\n\
    Greek root of which means \xE2\x80\x9Cself-rule\xE2\x80\x9D. Why? Because only people free to\n\
    direct and govern their lives according to their own values are\n\
    recognised by others as having what Australian philosopher Robert Young\n\
    describes as \xE2\x80\x9Cthe dignity that moral agency bestows\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>There are three reasons to doubt that the Government\xE2\x80\x99s proposed measures\n\
    will foster women\xE2\x80\x99s autonomy and protect their dignity. The first is\n\
    that, as their title makes clear, they are designed to support\n\
    pregnancies, not women. If pregnancy maintenance, not quality\n\
    decision-making, is the name of the game, it\xE2\x80\x99s hard to see how factually\n\
    accurate and non-directive support and advice is on the cards.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Ditto the undisguised aim of both measures: to reduce the abortion rate.\n\
    The Government says they are necessary to address Australia\xE2\x80\x99s high\n\
    abortion rate. At the news conference launching the plan, the Prime\n\
    Minister said: \xE2\x80\x9CWe don\xE2\x80\x99t like the number of abortions. We think it\xE2\x80\x99s too\n\
    high.\xE2\x80\x9D How can a service designed to stop women having abortions (how\n\
    else to reduce the abortion rate?) provide impartial, non-directive\n\
    advice? How can such a service meet the ethical requirement of promoting\n\
    women\xE2\x80\x99s autonomy? Won\xE2\x80\x99t the successful tenderer be evaluated on how well\n\
    it achieves the Government\xE2\x80\x99s aims of reducing the abortion rate? If so,\n\
    how can we expect this service to do anything other than discourage\n\
    women from choosing abortion?</p>\n\n\
    <p>This worry is exacerbated by the Government\xE2\x80\x99s insistence that religious\n\
    organisations will be eligible to tender for the telephone helpline\n\
    contract. While abortion service-providers and counsellors working in\n\
    abortion clinics have been seen as having a \xE2\x80\x9Cconflict of interest\xE2\x80\x9D that\n\
    renders them incapable of providing impartial, non-directive support and\n\
    referral for all three options available to pregnant women &ndash; abortion,\n\
    adoption and continuing &ndash; religious providers are not. This beggars\n\
    belief, particularly given the widespread acceptance of medical\n\
    conscientious objection not just to providing abortion services, but\n\
    referring women to someone who will.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Moral conflicts of interest are as real as financial ones, and there is\n\
    little doubt that a tender process truly committed to identifying a\n\
    service committed to fostering women\xE2\x80\x99s autonomy would rule out\n\
    applicants with religious or philosophical objections to abortion.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The truth is that if the Government wants to reduce the abortion rate,\n\
    the most ethical and effective approach is to tackle unplanned\n\
    pregnancies. No woman wants to be pregnant when she feels unable &ndash;\n\
    because she is unemployed, homeless, single, living in a violent home or\n\
    is just a teenager herself &ndash; to be a good and responsible parent to the\n\
    child. This makes government support for education and contraception\n\
    access programs not only the most effective way to lower the abortion\n\
    rate, but &ndash; because it supports women to achieve shared aims &ndash; the only\n\
    ethical one.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Pregnancies don\xE2\x80\x99t need support, women do. They also need respect. The\n\
    aim of any legitimate counselling service must be to foster women\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    autonomy, not to achieve government aims such as reducing the number of\n\
    abortions or increasing the birthrate. Using women as a means to\n\
    government or church ends is not just unethical, it may lead to women\n\
    being deceived or induced &ndash; perhaps even coerced through false\n\
    information or an absence of timely advice &ndash; into having an unwanted\n\
    child: not a recipe for happy families.</p>\n\n\
    <p>If a financial conflict of interest is seen to render those involved\n\
    with abortions ineligible to provide impartial advice, support and\n\
    referral for all three options with an unplanned pregnancy, a moral\n\
    conflict of interest surely rules religious and pro-life providers out,\n\
    too.</p>\n\n\
    <p>At a minimum, the potential for abuse of trust must be acknowledged. It\n\
    is likely that women will assume that neutrally named services,\n\

    support them to make a choice consistent with their situation and\n\
    values. If the agency running the helpline has a religious or\n\

    on all advertising materials.</p>\n\n\
    <p>They must also be told it when they ring. And offered an alternative\n\

  content_markup: "<p>Crochet hooks, castor oil, slippery elm bark, syringes full of Lifeuboy\n\
    soap and Dettol. Sepsis, gas gangrene of the uterus, hysterectomies on\n\
    12 year olds, deserted pregnant wives taking their children and jumping\n\
    off the St Kilda pier and women waiting, scared and alone, on a dark\n\
    windswept corner of Bourke Street for the stranger\xE2\x80\x99s car that would take\n\
    them, huddled beneath a blanket on the floor of the backseat, to the\n\
    backyard abortionist. And if they haemorrhaged on the kitchen table, the\n\
    best they could hope for was to be dumped on the corner near the Royal\n\
    Women\xE2\x80\x99s in the hope that someone would find them in time. Many died.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This was the reproductive terrain that Victorian women were forced to\n\
    negotiate 35 years ago when their \xE2\x80\x9Clittle friend\xE2\x80\x9D failed to arrive and,\n\
    because they were sick, poor, young, bashed or simply unable to shoulder\n\
    the burdens of motherhood at that time, decided to seek an abortion. For\n\
    women of means, the illegal procedure would be provided by a qualified\n\
    gynaecologist in the comfort of a private hospital. Poor women took\n\
    their chances with well-meaning neighbourhood \xE2\x80\x9CVera Drakes\xE2\x80\x9D or similarly\n\
    unqualified \xE2\x80\x9Cbackyarders.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>In 1967 Bertram Wainer, a Scottish-born St Kilda GP with a passionate\n\
    commitment to social justice and Jo Wainer, incipient feminist and\n\
    inaugural secretary of the Abortion Law Reform Association, sought\n\
    reform. In the process, they uncovered a web of corruption involving\n\
    doctors, backyard abortionists, high-ranking policemen and suspect\n\
    politicians. They ran three separate test cases to test the reach of the\n\
    newly-minted Menhennitt ruling that allowed abortion, prohibited in the\n\
    Victorian Crimes Act, in a limited range of circumstances.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Bert Wainer\xE2\x80\x99s story is told in Abortion, Corruption &amp; Cops, a film by\n\
    writer/director John Moore, whose previous credits include the\n\
    award-winning documentary Guns &amp; Roses and Thomas of Arnhem Land. Moving\n\
    seamlessly between archival footage and dramatic recreations with Kurt\n\
    Geyer as Bert Wainer and Genevieve Picot as\n\
    backyard-abortionist-turned-good Peggy Berman, Moore summons up the\n\
    stifling prudery and religious moralism of the era. He interviews\n\
    grandmotherly-looking women whose eyes grow bright with fright as they\n\
    remember having to spread their legs on a stranger\xE2\x80\x99s kitchen table while\n\
    instruments boiled away on the stove, or who still find it hard to laugh\n\
    when they recall how an unwanted pregnancy gave a girl first-hand\n\
    knowledge of the \xE2\x80\x9Clies, exploitation and deviousness\xE2\x80\x9D that accompany all\n\
    illegal practices.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But Bert Wainer\xE2\x80\x99s story should resonate for more than just history\n\
    buffs. The Federal Government\xE2\x80\x99s ill-disguised antagonism towards women\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    reproductive rights gives relevance to Wainer\xE2\x80\x99s assertion that \xE2\x80\x9Cabortion\n\
    will continue and have little, if anything, to do with the Church, the\n\
    law or the doctors, but have a very great deal to do with people and\n\
    particularly with women\xE2\x80\x9D. His moral indignation about police\n\
    confiscation of medical files, which he saw as an attack patient privacy\n\
    and dignity, seems a salutary reminder of the importance of these values\n\
    in light of recent government proposals to introduce a specific Medicare\n\
    item number for abortion counselling that could enable tracking of\n\
    doctors and women. \xE2\x80\x9CEvery child a wanted child\xE2\x80\x9D, the poster Wainer\n\
    proudly hangs in his newly opened fertility clinic in East Melbourne,\n\
    remains a pertinent reply to those who hand-wring about the number of\n\
    abortions.</p>\n\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CStand for something or fall for anything\xE2\x80\x9D, goes the old saying. Until\n\
    his death in 1987, Wainer stood for many things. It was his deep respect\n\
    for the police and their role in enforcing the rule of law that saw him\n\
    devastated by his discovery of corruption in the force, and his decision\n\
    to turn whistle-blower. As a medical student and intern, he\xE2\x80\x99d had little\n\
    interest in abortion and, like other reputable doctors at the time, had\n\
    simply referred women to illegal provides when they came to him for\n\
    help. But when a woman came into his surgery dying from a botched\n\
    abortion but too terrified to go to hospital for fear of arrest, he\n\
    refused to look the other way. He got indignant, angry and &ndash; in the best\n\
    feminist tradition &ndash; active. But while sympathetic to women, Wainer was\n\
    no feminist. The man Moore describes in Abortion Corruption &amp; Cops is a\n\
    social justice campaigner. A man whose own deprived upbringing had\n\
    alerted him to the ways in which the rich could circumvent harsh and\n\
    unjust laws, while the poor were forced to live with &ndash; or die from &ndash;\n\
    their consequences.</p>\n\n\

  content: "Crochet hooks, castor oil, slippery elm bark, syringes full of Lifeuboy\r\n\
    soap and Dettol. Sepsis, gas gangrene of the uterus, hysterectomies on\r\n\
    12 year olds, deserted pregnant wives taking their children and jumping\r\n\
    off the St Kilda pier and women waiting, scared and alone, on a dark\r\n\
    windswept corner of Bourke Street for the stranger\xE2\x80\x99s car that would take\r\n\
    them, huddled beneath a blanket on the floor of the backseat, to the\r\n\
    backyard abortionist. And if they haemorrhaged on the kitchen table, the\r\n\
    best they could hope for was to be dumped on the corner near the Royal\r\n\
    Women\xE2\x80\x99s in the hope that someone would find them in time. Many died.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This was the reproductive terrain that Victorian women were forced to\r\n\
    negotiate 35 years ago when their \xE2\x80\x9Clittle friend\xE2\x80\x9D failed to arrive and,\r\n\
    because they were sick, poor, young, bashed or simply unable to shoulder\r\n\
    the burdens of motherhood at that time, decided to seek an abortion. For\r\n\
    women of means, the illegal procedure would be provided by a qualified\r\n\
    gynaecologist in the comfort of a private hospital. Poor women took\r\n\
    their chances with well-meaning neighbourhood \xE2\x80\x9CVera Drakes\xE2\x80\x9D or similarly\r\n\
    unqualified \xE2\x80\x9Cbackyarders.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In 1967 Bertram Wainer, a Scottish-born St Kilda GP with a passionate\r\n\
    commitment to social justice and Jo Wainer, incipient feminist and\r\n\
    inaugural secretary of the Abortion Law Reform Association, sought\r\n\
    reform. In the process, they uncovered a web of corruption involving\r\n\
    doctors, backyard abortionists, high-ranking policemen and suspect\r\n\
    politicians. They ran three separate test cases to test the reach of the\r\n\
    newly-minted Menhennitt ruling that allowed abortion, prohibited in the\r\n\
    Victorian Crimes Act, in a limited range of circumstances.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Bert Wainer\xE2\x80\x99s story is told in Abortion, Corruption & Cops, a film by\r\n\
    writer/director John Moore, whose previous credits include the\r\n\
    award-winning documentary Guns & Roses and Thomas of Arnhem Land. Moving\r\n\
    seamlessly between archival footage and dramatic recreations with Kurt\r\n\
    Geyer as Bert Wainer and Genevieve Picot as\r\n\
    backyard-abortionist-turned-good Peggy Berman, Moore summons up the\r\n\
    stifling prudery and religious moralism of the era. He interviews\r\n\
    grandmotherly-looking women whose eyes grow bright with fright as they\r\n\
    remember having to spread their legs on a stranger\xE2\x80\x99s kitchen table while\r\n\
    instruments boiled away on the stove, or who still find it hard to laugh\r\n\
    when they recall how an unwanted pregnancy gave a girl first-hand\r\n\
    knowledge of the \xE2\x80\x9Clies, exploitation and deviousness\xE2\x80\x9D that accompany all\r\n\
    illegal practices.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But Bert Wainer\xE2\x80\x99s story should resonate for more than just history\r\n\
    buffs. The Federal Government\xE2\x80\x99s ill-disguised antagonism towards women\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    reproductive rights gives relevance to Wainer\xE2\x80\x99s assertion that \xE2\x80\x9Cabortion\r\n\
    will continue and have little, if anything, to do with the Church, the\r\n\
    law or the doctors, but have a very great deal to do with people and\r\n\
    particularly with women\xE2\x80\x9D. His moral indignation about police\r\n\
    confiscation of medical files, which he saw as an attack patient privacy\r\n\
    and dignity, seems a salutary reminder of the importance of these values\r\n\
    in light of recent government proposals to introduce a specific Medicare\r\n\
    item number for abortion counselling that could enable tracking of\r\n\
    doctors and women. \xE2\x80\x9CEvery child a wanted child\xE2\x80\x9D, the poster Wainer\r\n\
    proudly hangs in his newly opened fertility clinic in East Melbourne,\r\n\
    remains a pertinent reply to those who hand-wring about the number of\r\n\
    abortions.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CStand for something or fall for anything\xE2\x80\x9D, goes the old saying. Until\r\n\
    his death in 1987, Wainer stood for many things. It was his deep respect\r\n\
    for the police and their role in enforcing the rule of law that saw him\r\n\
    devastated by his discovery of corruption in the force, and his decision\r\n\
    to turn whistle-blower. As a medical student and intern, he\xE2\x80\x99d had little\r\n\
    interest in abortion and, like other reputable doctors at the time, had\r\n\
    simply referred women to illegal provides when they came to him for\r\n\
    help. But when a woman came into his surgery dying from a botched\r\n\
    abortion but too terrified to go to hospital for fear of arrest, he\r\n\
    refused to look the other way. He got indignant, angry and - in the best\r\n\
    feminist tradition - active. But while sympathetic to women, Wainer was\r\n\
    no feminist. The man Moore describes in Abortion Corruption & Cops is a\r\n\
    social justice campaigner. A man whose own deprived upbringing had\r\n\
    alerted him to the ways in which the rich could circumvent harsh and\r\n\
    unjust laws, while the poor were forced to live with - or die from -\r\n\
    their consequences.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In her new book about women\xE2\x80\x99s stories of illegal abortion, timed for\r\n\
    release to coincide with the screening of Abortion, Corruption & Cops,\r\n\

  content_markup: "<p>Pregnancy counsellors must declare their stance on abortion.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Australian women have just inched one step closer to gaining access to\n\
    RU486. Last week, Cairns-based obstetrician Dr Caroline De Costa\n\
    received word that her application to become an authorised prescriber of\n\
    the medication had been approved by the national drug regulator, the\n\
    Therapeutic Goods Administration.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Despite the fanfare surrounding February\xE2\x80\x99s passage of the cross-party\n\
    bill that removed the Heath Minister\xE2\x80\x99s veto over the TGA\xE2\x80\x99s decision to\n\
    register the drug, pregnant women are still awaiting access to the\n\
    medication &ndash; as a morning-after pill, to assist in labour or to\n\
    terminate a very early pregnancy without surgery &ndash; because no company\n\
    has submitted an application.</p>\n\n\
    <p>While De Costa\xE2\x80\x99s approval as an authorised prescriber comes with\n\
    restrictions that preclude her from supplying other medical\n\
    practitioners with the drug, or accepting patients living outside far\n\
    north Queensland, it both signals and further strengthens the case for\n\
    TGA registration of the drug when an application is finally submitted.\n\
    This is because to say \xE2\x80\x9Cyes\xE2\x80\x9D to De Costa, the TGA has to evaluate the\n\
    drug\xE2\x80\x99s safety and efficacy against the seriousness of the condition, and\n\
    the acceptability of existing therapies to treat it. Signing off on her\n\
    application signals the regulator\xE2\x80\x99s acceptance of the veracity and\n\
    quality of the research data demonstrating the drug\xE2\x80\x99s safety and\n\
    efficacy that De Costa was required to submit to support her\n\
    application. This bodes well for requests before the TGA from other\n\
    medicos wanting to become authorised prescribers and an application by a\n\
    pharmaceutical company &ndash; when one finally is made &ndash; to make the drug\n\
    more broadly available.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Pro-choice supporters would also have been heartened by the recent\n\
    elevation of the staunchly pro-choice Louise Asher to the position of\n\
    deputy leader of the Liberal Party in Victoria to join pro-choice leader\n\
    Robert Doyle. With the Victorian Labor Party having recently affirmed\n\
    its commitment to amend the Victorian Crimes Act to make abortion legal\n\
    when a woman gives her informed consent, the stage is set for change\n\
    after the election in November.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Elsewhere, however, pro-life forces are making their influence felt. As\n\
    in Victoria, the Crimes Act in NSW prohibits abortion. Earlier this\n\
    month, the Crown prosecutor in the case of NSW doctor Dr Suman Sood\n\
    moved to amend the indictment to include a second charge of\n\
    administering a drug with \xE2\x80\x9Cintent to procure a miscarriage\xE2\x80\x9D. If Sood is\n\
    convicted, women\xE2\x80\x99s access to safe, legal terminations could be reduced\n\
    in NSW through the narrowing of the reach of the 1971 and 1995 common\n\
    law judgements that enable lawful abortion.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But perhaps nowhere have pro-life forces been more successful than in\n\
    their co-option of the word \xE2\x80\x9Ccounselling\xE2\x80\x9D to pursue their goal of\n\
    reducing women\xE2\x80\x99s access to abortion.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In addition to being on the Federal Government payroll to the tune of\n\
    $295,000 in 2005 and 2006, the pro-life Australian Federation of\n\
    Pregnancy Support Services (formerly the Australian Federation of\n\
    Pro-Life Pregnancy Support Services) is manoeuvring to win the tender to\n\
    provide a national telephone helpline to support women to keep\n\
    pregnancies. The helpline, one of two recently announced \xE2\x80\x9Cpregnancy\n\
    support measures\xE2\x80\x9D, is seen as compensation for Health Minister Tony\n\
    Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s loss of control over RU486.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Will AFPSS win the helpline tender? They\xE2\x80\x99re certainly in contention,\n\
    because while the Government has ruled out abortion providers from\n\
    tendering for the contract to ensure the provision of a \xE2\x80\x9Cnon-directive\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    service, organisations with a religious or philosophical opposition to\n\
    abortion have been deemed to have the professionalism and\n\
    even-handedness necessary to apply.</p>\n\n\
    <p>While some Australians might question the appropriateness of the Federal\n\
    Government coat of arms being attached to a telephone hotline staffed by\n\
    a service with a principled opposition to advising or referring for\n\
    abortion, few would dispute the right of women to be told up-front and\n\
    unequivocally if a service will provide accurate information about, and\n\
    refer for, abortion. Yet there is no consumer protection regulation in\n\
    any state that prohibits pregnancy clinics from falsely advertising\n\
    their services. Because the services don\xE2\x80\x99t levy a fee, the Australian\n\
    Competition and Consumer Commission cannot charge them with engaging in\n\
    misleading or deceptive advertising.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Last year, Pregnancy Counselling Australia, which has links to\n\
    international pro-life pregnancy centres, sent posters to GPs across the\n\
    country. Depicting the photo of a young attractive woman chewing her\n\
    nails the text read: \xE2\x80\x9CPregnant? Upset?\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9CFree, confidential,\n\
    compassionate, counselling\xE2\x80\x9D on a 24-hour basis was promised to women who\n\
    rang the number provided. While the vast majority of GPs are pro-choice,\n\
    many were fooled by the poster and the accompanying covering letter that\n\
    implied that Pregnancy Counselling Australia offered a service that\n\
    would support and refer women for all three options with an unplanned\n\
    pregnancy: adoption, continuing and abortion. As Pregnancy Counselling\n\
    Australia requested, many put the poster in their consulting suites and\n\

    <p>The Democrats have developed a private member\xE2\x80\x99s bill to ensure truth in\n\
    advertising when it comes to pregnancy support services. To become law,\n\

    is: after the battle over RU486, do pro-choice activists and politicians\n\
    have the energy to battle as hard as will be required to achieve basic\n\
    consumer protection for pregnant women?</p>\n"

    <p>&ldquo;Go home, have sex and forget about it. That\xE2\x80\x99s what doctors used to tell\n\
    infertile couples in the early days of donor insemination. Donors, too,\n\

    Persistent confusion between male fertility and potency, and the\n\

    \r\n\
    \"Go home, have sex and forget about it. That\xE2\x80\x99s what doctors used to tell\r\n\
    infertile couples in the early days of donor insemination. Donors, too,\r\n\
    were assumed to want, and were provided with, total anonymity as a\r\n\
    condition for their donation. In some instances, no records of the event\r\n\
    - little less non-identifying information about the donor - were kept.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Many Australians would be matter of fact about donor insemination as a\r\n\
    means of creating a family, but stigma still attaches to the procedure.\r\n\
    Persistent confusion between male fertility and potency, and the\r\n\
    insistence of critics that it constitutes infidelity and encourages an\r\n\

    <p>It is said that every culture has prohibitions against hypocrisy. In all\n\

    character-flaws like hubris, dishonesty and an inability to take\n\

    about the presence of such qualities in all those we deal with (I\xE2\x80\x99d opt\n\
    for a Logan\xE2\x80\x99s Run-esque blinking palm light myself), we feel entitled &ndash;\n\
    rightly I think &ndash; to get the skinny on such matters when it comes to\n\

    <p>This is because the stature of public figures like Hunt give them\n\

    power to shape the world in which we live, either through the\n\
    implementation of policy, or the use of media platforms to influence\n\
    health, fashion or lifestyle trends. When AFL footballers are condemned\n\
    for their shabby treatment of women, it\xE2\x80\x99s not just because such\n\
    behaviour &ndash; no matter who does it &ndash; merits our disapproval, but also\n\
    because they aren\xE2\x80\x99t anyone. They are the blokes our kids, particularly\n\
    boys aged 6 to 20, admire and seek to emulate. They speak and we listen.\n\
    I mean, d\xE2\x80\x99oh! That\xE2\x80\x99s why our so many Fortune 500 companies are after\n\

    <p>This means two things. Firstly, that the public may be justified in\n\

    Joe and Judy Blow. Some people might argue this is unfair. They did when\n\
    Wayne Carey was being pilloried for simultaneously doing the dirty on\n\
    his best friend and his own partner Sally by sleeping with Anthony\n\

    their capacity to command an audience to outline their moral view about\n\
    how we should all run our marriages, manage our health or rationalise\n\
    our citizenships, it seems only fair to expect them to practice what\n\
    they preach, or to suffer the pain of being outed as a hypocrite. It was\n\
    former Liberal politician Ross Cameron\xE2\x80\x99s choice to gallivant around his\n\
    electorate preaching family values, and plastering photos of his four\n\
    children and smiling wife across his promotional materials. When he also\n\

    if not obliged &ndash; to let the public know.</p>\n\n\
    <p>With benefits come costs; with license comes responsibility. Should this\n\
    responsibility not be met, the public has a right to know. The\n\

    err is human\xE2\x80\x9D script in our head. We may decide our hero still deserves\n\
    our worship or the politician our vote, or then again we might not.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Yes, public figures live in a fishbowl, but for most of them &ndash; and\n\
    certainly for Rex Hunt &ndash; that\xE2\x80\x99s their choice. Other jobs with lower\n\
    profiles and salaries are available; one\xE2\x80\x99s where the mismatch between\n\

    our citizenships, it seems only fair to expect them to practice what\r\n\
    they preach, or to suffer the pain of being outed as a hypocrite. It was\r\n\
    former Liberal politician Ross Cameron\xE2\x80\x99s choice to gallivant around his\r\n\
    electorate preaching family values, and plastering photos of his four\r\n\
    children and smiling wife across his promotional materials. When he also\r\n\
    chose not to keep his pants buttoned, the media was perfectly entitled -\r\n\
    if not obliged - to let the public know.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    With benefits come costs; with license comes responsibility. Should this\r\n\
    responsibility not be met, the public has a right to know. The\r\n\
    judgements we make from there is up to us. We may shrug, and run the \xE2\x80\x9Cto\r\n\
    err is human\xE2\x80\x9D script in our head. We may decide our hero still deserves\r\n\
    our worship or the politician our vote, or then again we might not.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Yes, public figures live in a fishbowl, but for most of them - and\r\n\
    certainly for Rex Hunt - that\xE2\x80\x99s their choice. Other jobs with lower\r\n\
    profiles and salaries are available; one\xE2\x80\x99s where the mismatch between\r\n\
    what one says and does are more likely to be overlooked.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Then too, there\xE2\x80\x99s always the option of just keeping one\xE2\x80\x99s one mouth\r\n\
    shut."

    <p>For some, but perhaps not enough of us, time and people divide into two\n\
    categories: the time before abortion laws were liberalised, and the time\n\
    after; those who remember what it was like prior to decriminalisation,\n\
    and those who don\xE2\x80\x99t.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Lost is about the time before, written for those who came after, or who\n\
    wish to pay tribute to the women they knew who lived through those\n\
    terrible before-times by bearing witness to their stories. It is edited\n\
    and introduced by Dr Jo Wainer whose own life, according to a somewhat\n\
    different chronology, also divides into before and after. Her first\n\
    20-odd years before she became the inaugural treasurer of the Abortion\n\
    Law Reform Association in 1967, and all that\xE2\x80\x99s come after in which, as\n\
    an activist, service-provider and now academic, she has dedicated to the\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Ctask of understanding the political, legal, religious, social and\n\
    medical issues\xE2\x80\xA6buried in that one word &ndash; abortion.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Wainer and writer Helen Garner, who authors a short foreword to the\n\
    collection, vividly describe the stifling, puritan backdrop of 1950s\n\
    Melbourne against which the dramas of individual women play out. But it\n\
    is Lost\xE2\x80\x99s collection of 21 first-hand accounts by aborting women &ndash; some\n\
    young, some old, nearly all poor &ndash; that captivate both attention and\n\
    heart. Stories, as Garner notes, that even without descriptions of the\n\
    women\xE2\x80\x99s appearance or the way her voice sounds and body moves as she\n\
    talks, still contain \xE2\x80\x9Cmatter enough for a novel\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Amy waited until marriage to have sex, only to discover she\xE2\x80\x99d prefer to\n\
    bake a \xE2\x80\x9Clovely sponge cake\xE2\x80\x9D than have intercourse with her violent\n\
    alcoholic husband. She had several children in quick succession before &ndash;\n\
    unable to find effective contraception or to resist her husband\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    attention &ndash; she endured several anaesthetic-free curettes in a\n\
    stranger\xE2\x80\x99s lounge room.</p>\n\n\
    <p>21-year old Belinda was denied the Pill by a doctor with a framed\n\
    picture of Mother Mary on his desk, and was lectured for half an hour on\n\
    the mortal sin of single women using contraception. When she became\n\
    pregnant, she wanted to continue, but her boyfriend refused to support\n\
    her. To get a safe abortion at 20 weeks she had to get a psychiatrist to\n\
    write a letter &ndash; the existence of which on her medical files spooked her\n\
    for years afterwards &ndash; saying she\xE2\x80\x99d be an unfit mother.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Sixteen year old Beverly\xE2\x80\x99s instructions from the backyarder who\n\
    consented to terminate her were as follows: \xE2\x80\x9CCome here Thursday morning\n\
    with $600, bring a packet of pads, a packet of Panadol and don\xE2\x80\x99t expect\n\
    to go home until Friday night\xE2\x80\x9D. When she hesitated before spreading her\n\
    legs on the man\xE2\x80\x99s kitchen table, he admonishes: \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t worry about your\n\
    pride and dignity now, girl. You lost that the day you got yourself into\n\
    this mess\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>And on it goes. Bashed women. Scared women. Women so ignorant of the\n\
    rudiments of sex they don\xE2\x80\x99t even realise they\xE2\x80\x99re pregnant until in\n\
    labour and, even then, have little idea from what orfice the baby will\n\
    emerge. Women who accepted the contempt and even sexual violence of\n\
    abortion providers or the doctors they relied on for referrals to safer\n\
    practitioners as apt punishment for the sexual \xE2\x80\x9Csins\xE2\x80\x9D that led to the\n\
    abortion, or the abortion itself. And women who, inexplicably given the\n\
    tone and tenor of the times, reject all efforts to make them feel like\n\
    dirt: \xE2\x80\x9CMind your own business and don\xE2\x80\x99t bother sending me a bill!\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    Belinda told the Mother Mary doctor before slamming the door behind her.\n\
    Says Beverly indignantly of her first interview with the backyard\n\
    provider: \xE2\x80\x9CHe didn\xE2\x80\x99t even ask my name\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\

    common elements of women\xE2\x80\x99s stories &ndash; the secrecy, the exploitation, the\n\
    violence, the suffering, the death &ndash; that gave them political charge. Jo\n\
    and Bert Wainer knew this, and while Bert solicited the stories in Lost\n\
    in 1985 in a \xE2\x80\x9Clest we forget\xE2\x80\x9D spirit, he had used newspaper ads to urge\n\
    women to speak their truths before, and had used the information he\n\
    elicited to raise awareness of the costs to women and to society &ndash;\n\
    through the flowering of police corruption &ndash; of prohibition. Women\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    stories were at the heart of the Wainers\xE2\x80\x99 agitation for a Royal\n\
    Commission into police corruption, and their pursuit of test cases that\n\
    established the reach of the common law ruling on which Victorian women\n\
    still rely for safe, legal services.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Before turning the first page of Lost, I hesitated. However worthy the\n\
    aim, I knew enough about the pre-legalisation era to know I was standing\n\
    on the threshold of a whole world of pain. But from Garner\xE2\x80\x99s opening\n\
    words &ndash; \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s an awe-inspiring force, the iron determination of a woman\n\
    who refuses to bear a child that she knows she cannot mother\xE2\x80\x9D &ndash; I was\n\
    hooked. Unable to put the book down, I read straight through to the end.</p>\n\n\
    <p>How could I have forgotten the compelling privilege of being invited\n\
    into the most painful and intimate corners of other people\xE2\x80\x99s lives? In\n\
    particular, I felt touched by the way in which women\xE2\x80\x99s fears, health and\n\
    lives were unquestionably at the centre of the moral Rubicon of\n\
    pre~~1980s abortion politics. Then, like now, the fetus was never far\n\
    from women\xE2\x80\x99s minds: its potential to be their helpless, demanding and\n\
    desperately-loved baby the impetus for the abortion in the first place.\n\
    But unlike today, where women must battle to be seen and heard in the\n\
    public debate against chaste, silhouetted images of fetuses set off in\n\
    surrounds reminiscent of space capsules, the womb was opaque. Women\n\
    decided what doctors, husbands and others would know of the developing\n\
    life inside, and it was their experience of gestation and impeding\n\
    motherhood~~ wonder-filled or terrifying, desired or unwanted &ndash; that\n\
    mediated its relationship with others.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Indeed, at the heart of the contemporary abortion debate is one about\n\
    the moral frame. Are women at the centre of the story; those who should\n\
    rightly evoke our compassion and hold the trumping rights, or is it\n\
    fetuses? Are women autonomous choosers of abortion or duped and bereaved\n\
    victims of it?</p>\n\n\
    <p>I feel confident about what the Wainers, and the women of Lost, would\n\
    say.</p>\n"

    several weeks ago renewed controversy about the show\xE2\x80\x99s suitability for\n\
    free-to-air TV.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Of course for some, the issue was decided long ago. Victorian Family\n\
    Council Secretary Bill Muelenberg, Family First Senator Senator Steven\n\
    Fielding and Queensland Nationals MP Paul Neville have long condemned\n\
    the show as sleazy and dangerously sexually licentious. In the wake of\n\
    the weekend\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cincident\xE2\x80\x9D, this conga line was joined by the leaders of\n\
    both major parties. The Opposition Leader lamented the show\xE2\x80\x99s treatment\n\
    of young women, while the Prime Minister asked Channel Ten to take the\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cstupid program\xE2\x80\x9D off air.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Are calls for media self-censorship evidence of feminist inroads into\n\
    the sensibilities of the nation\xE2\x80\x99s leaders, the relentless crusade of\n\
    Christian moralists to control what the rest of us see, hear and read,\n\
    or just plain commonsense? Was the two minutes that shook the world in\n\
    the collective bedroom of the Big Brother household evidence of the\n\
    depravity of today\xE2\x80\x99s male youth, or just how far &ndash; in the sexual\n\
    politics stakes &ndash; they\xE2\x80\x99ve come?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Deciding requires us to disentangle the varied business and moral\n\
    mandates in play. From a commercial point of view, it\xE2\x80\x99s arguable that\n\
    Channel 10 had little choice but to follow the advice of media studies\n\
    academic Catherine Lumby and evict the men from the house for being on\n\
    the wrong side of what Lumby described as the line dividing \xE2\x80\x9Csexual\n\
    behaviour and sexual assault\xE2\x80\x9D. The recent axing of Big Brother Adults\n\
    after pressure from Coalition MPs proved the not inconsiderable sway of\n\
    the Christian right in this country, and appeasing them by turfing the\n\
    men out and inviting the Queensland police to investigate made good\n\
    business sense.</p>\n\n\

  content: "The recent \xE2\x80\x9CCamilla\xE2\x80\x9D incident streamed from the Big Brother house\r\n\
    several weeks ago renewed controversy about the show\xE2\x80\x99s suitability for\r\n\
    free-to-air TV.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Of course for some, the issue was decided long ago. Victorian Family\r\n\
    Council Secretary Bill Muelenberg, Family First Senator Senator Steven\r\n\
    Fielding and Queensland Nationals MP Paul Neville have long condemned\r\n\
    the show as sleazy and dangerously sexually licentious. In the wake of\r\n\
    the weekend\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cincident\xE2\x80\x9D, this conga line was joined by the leaders of\r\n\
    both major parties. The Opposition Leader lamented the show\xE2\x80\x99s treatment\r\n\
    of young women, while the Prime Minister asked Channel Ten to take the\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cstupid program\xE2\x80\x9D off air.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Are calls for media self-censorship evidence of feminist inroads into\r\n\
    the sensibilities of the nation\xE2\x80\x99s leaders, the relentless crusade of\r\n\
    Christian moralists to control what the rest of us see, hear and read,\r\n\
    or just plain commonsense? Was the two minutes that shook the world in\r\n\
    the collective bedroom of the Big Brother household evidence of the\r\n\
    depravity of today\xE2\x80\x99s male youth, or just how far - in the sexual\r\n\
    politics stakes - they\xE2\x80\x99ve come?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Deciding requires us to disentangle the varied business and moral\r\n\
    mandates in play. From a commercial point of view, it\xE2\x80\x99s arguable that\r\n\
    Channel 10 had little choice but to follow the advice of media studies\r\n\
    academic Catherine Lumby and evict the men from the house for being on\r\n\
    the wrong side of what Lumby described as the line dividing \xE2\x80\x9Csexual\r\n\
    behaviour and sexual assault\xE2\x80\x9D. The recent axing of Big Brother Adults\r\n\
    after pressure from Coalition MPs proved the not inconsiderable sway of\r\n\
    the Christian right in this country, and appeasing them by turfing the\r\n\
    men out and inviting the Queensland police to investigate made good\r\n\
    business sense.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The network\xE2\x80\x99s response, however, says little about whether the behaviour\r\n\
    of the two men merited condemnation on moral grounds. Lumby said the men\r\n\
    were guilty of sexual assault, while Communications Minister Helen\r\n\

    runs the genetic program for skin &ndash; into a donated human egg that\xE2\x80\x99s own\n\

  title: The Net Brings You The World, But Not Necessarily the Facts
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:50:10
  content_markup: "<p>It\xE2\x80\x99s enough to make you feel queasy. A recent Harris poll found that\n\
    half the American public &ndash; up from 36% last year ~~believe Iraq had\n\
    weapons of mass destruction at the time of the US invasion. This despite\n\
    the fact that final report of the Iraq Survey Group~~ experts handpicked\n\
    by the CIA and Pentagon &ndash; concluded that Iraq had no deployable\n\

    the capacity of the average punter to be heard. By sheer weight of\n\
    numbers, the proliferation of media outlets, personal websites, blogs\n\
    and forums on the Web offer punters the chance to move beyond passive\n\
    consumption of the news towards an active role in shaping it.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But herein lies the rub. Peruse personal websites, blogs and the comment\n\
    sections offered by mainstream and boutique news sites, and amid the\n\
    sometimes insightful and occasionally amusing commentary are a\n\
    significant number of contributions in contention for the\n\
    totally-missed-the-point, played-the-person-not-the-ball, mono-rail-mind\n\
    or axe-to-grind awards. On one Australian opinion site, a band of \xE2\x80\x9Cforum\n\
    participants\xE2\x80\x9D with masculine, often gladiatorial-sounding names, roam\n\
    from one female-authored article to the next displaying both significant\n\
    anger management and comprehension issues.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Further, despite names suggestive of a certain seriousness of purpose\n\
    many personal websites and blogs are little more than cyber-cliques\n\
    where the initiated preach to the paranoid in a closed and unfalsifiable\n\
    system of proof. \xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99re entitled to your own opinion, not your own\n\

    \xE2\x80\x9Canalysis\xE2\x80\x9D of a CNN presenter\xE2\x80\x99s concern about the results of the Harris\n\
    poll is anything to go by, the folks at Newsbusters.org (\xE2\x80\x9CExposing and\n\

    <p>I am not saying that the sort of hierarchical editorial processes\n\
    traditionally exercised in newsrooms across the globe are the only one\n\
    that can achieve accurate, coherent, pointed and\n\
    argumentatively-rigorous content. A recent peer-reviewed study in Nature\n\
    found that Wikipedia science entries were nearly as accurate as those\n\
    found in Encyclopaedia Britannica (4 errors per article versus 3). This\n\

    creation clearly involves more time and stress for content-creators than\n\
    traditional editorial processes (collaboration always does), it offers\n\
    readers distinct advantages. Perhaps most valuable is their exposure to\n\
    the contested nature of some historical and scientific debates.\n\

    extensive forum participation indicates the topicality and disputed\n\
    nature of the subject. What such contributions need is not the sort of\n\
    transparent fact-checking process offered by Wikipedia, but a less\n\

  title: Abbott playing fast and loose with the truth
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:49:46
  content_markup: "<p>Since becoming Federal Health Minister, Tony Abbott has demonstrated a\n\
    casual, at times even antagonistic, relationship with facts that don\xE2\x80\x99t\n\
    support his moral views. This week\xE2\x80\x99s performance on Insiders continued\n\
    this lamentable tradition. The Minister claimed that non-Government\n\
    politicians supported \xE2\x80\x9Chuman cloning\xE2\x80\x9D, that the Government\xE2\x80\x99s own expert\n\
    panel recommended the creation of \xE2\x80\x9Chuman animal hybrids\xE2\x80\x9D, and that a\n\
    private member\xE2\x80\x99s bill sponsored by Senator Natasha Stott Despoja would\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cforce\xE2\x80\x9D pro-life organisations to \xE2\x80\x9Crefer people to abortion services\xE2\x80\x9D,\n\
    and deny federal funding to those that didn\xE2\x80\x99t.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In fact, the Lockhart Committee, as well as every reputable scientists\n\
    in the country, has supported a ban on reproductive cloning: the\n\
    implantation in a woman\xE2\x80\x99s womb of an embryo created in the lab using a\n\
    technique called Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer. Senator Stott Despoja\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    bill does not require any pregnancy counselling agency to refer a woman\n\
    for an abortion. It simply demands that all services advertise in ways\n\
    that make clear to women whether they are pro-life or pro-choice.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It is noteworthy that while the Health Minister copped criticism from\n\
    all sides for what Queensland Liberal MP Michael Johnson labeled\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cclearly inaccurate language\xE2\x80\x9D, and what Senator Stott Despoja described\n\
    as either \xE2\x80\x9Cconfusion\xE2\x80\x9D or a deliberate attempt by the Minister to mislead\n\
    the public, the Prime Minister is unconcerned. \xE2\x80\x9CEverybody can express\n\
    their view\xE2\x80\x9D, he told ABC radio. \xE2\x80\x9CTony Abbott should not be restricted in\n\
    what he says just because he\xE2\x80\x99s the Health Minister\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But this response misses the point. Abbott is not being condemned for\n\
    what he believes, or for making his views plain, but for playing fast\n\
    and loose with the facts: a problem that his status as Federal Minister\n\
    for Health arguably makes worse.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Exaggerating, sensationalising, decontextualising, misconstruing,\n\
    mischaracterizing and misleading are all variations on the dishonesty\n\
    charge. In one case, there is a hair to split. In response to concerns\n\
    raised predominantly by pro-life groups that the demand for human eggs\n\
    left women vulnerable to exploitation, the Lockhart committee did\n\
    recommend a lifting of the ban on scientists pursuing the derivation of\n\
    embryonic stem cells from somatic cell nuclear transfer undertaken on\n\
    animal eggs. However, the recommendation clearly stipulates that such\n\
    embryos \xE2\x80\x9Cnot [be] implanted into the body of a woman or allowed to\n\
    develop for more than 14 days.\xE2\x80\x9D Hardly the living and breathing\n\
    Transylvanian chimera evoked by the Health Minister\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Chuman animal\n\
    hybrid\xE2\x80\x9D claim.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But charges of inaccuracy must be upheld for the remainder of the\n\
    Minister\xE2\x80\x99s remarks. In fact, clarifications on the point the Minister\n\
    fudged with regard to pregnancy counselling were repeatedly offered\n\
    during hearings into the bill conducted around the nation last month.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Some may see such criticism as beside the point. Isn\xE2\x80\x99t the Health\n\
    Minister\xE2\x80\x99s only crime his willingness to be more open and honest than\n\
    other politicians about this passions and biases? Surely, given the\n\
    chance, all politicians attempt to shape law and policy to fit their\n\
    ideals. Why else pursue power?</p>\n\n\
    <p>This is true to a point. But use and abuse of power are two different\n\
    things. Telling fibs to discredit one\xE2\x80\x99s opponents and their case for\n\
    change, not to mention relying on the prestige of high office to bolster\n\
    one\xE2\x80\x99s falsehoods, is just not cricket. Rather, it is a condemnable\n\
    means-to-an-end strategy that disregards the rules for fair play in the\n\
    service of winning at all costs.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Further, those who operate in this fashion rule themselves out of the\n\
    role of honest broker in the event that their preferred approach is not\n\
    the one delivered by democratic processes. This has been the case with\n\
    Abbott and the drug RU486. Having fought so hard, and at times unfairly,\n\
    to prevent the removal of his ministerial veto over women\xE2\x80\x99s access to\n\
    the drug (phrases like \xE2\x80\x9Cbackyard miscarriage\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cpop and forget\xE2\x80\x9D pill\n\
    peppered his contributions to the debate), significant questions hang\n\
    over his capacity to impartially oversee the post-conscience-vote\n\
    processes required to bring the drug to the market. In May, a\n\
    pharmaceutical company executive revealed that the Minister and his\n\
    office threatened his company with adverse consequences if it applied to\n\
    register the drug in Australia.</p>\n\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CThe thing I enjoy most as a politician,\xE2\x80\x9D Tony Abbott said recently, \xE2\x80\x9Cis\n\
    the opportunity to be taken seriously when you say something\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Too right. And with such power comes responsibility. Tony Abottt is no\n\
    fool. He\xE2\x80\x99s more than capable of getting across a brief, if this is what\n\
    he wishes to do. Minister Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s failure to get the facts right when\n\
    issues of gender, reproduction and sexuality are at stake undermines the\n\
    quality of public debate on such matters.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It also casts doubt not just on his fitness for high office, but the\n\
    wisdom of the man who keeps him there.</p>\n"

  content: "Since becoming Federal Health Minister, Tony Abbott has demonstrated a\r\n\
    casual, at times even antagonistic, relationship with facts that don\xE2\x80\x99t\r\n\
    support his moral views. This week\xE2\x80\x99s performance on Insiders continued\r\n\
    this lamentable tradition. The Minister claimed that non-Government\r\n\
    politicians supported \xE2\x80\x9Chuman cloning\xE2\x80\x9D, that the Government\xE2\x80\x99s own expert\r\n\
    panel recommended the creation of \xE2\x80\x9Chuman animal hybrids\xE2\x80\x9D, and that a\r\n\
    private member\xE2\x80\x99s bill sponsored by Senator Natasha Stott Despoja would\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cforce\xE2\x80\x9D pro-life organisations to \xE2\x80\x9Crefer people to abortion services\xE2\x80\x9D,\r\n\
    and deny federal funding to those that didn\xE2\x80\x99t.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In fact, the Lockhart Committee, as well as every reputable scientists\r\n\
    in the country, has supported a ban on reproductive cloning: the\r\n\
    implantation in a woman\xE2\x80\x99s womb of an embryo created in the lab using a\r\n\
    technique called Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer. Senator Stott Despoja\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    bill does not require any pregnancy counselling agency to refer a woman\r\n\
    for an abortion. It simply demands that all services advertise in ways\r\n\
    that make clear to women whether they are pro-life or pro-choice.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It is noteworthy that while the Health Minister copped criticism from\r\n\
    all sides for what Queensland Liberal MP Michael Johnson labeled\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cclearly inaccurate language\xE2\x80\x9D, and what Senator Stott Despoja described\r\n\
    as either \xE2\x80\x9Cconfusion\xE2\x80\x9D or a deliberate attempt by the Minister to mislead\r\n\
    the public, the Prime Minister is unconcerned. \xE2\x80\x9CEverybody can express\r\n\
    their view\xE2\x80\x9D, he told ABC radio. \xE2\x80\x9CTony Abbott should not be restricted in\r\n\
    what he says just because he\xE2\x80\x99s the Health Minister\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But this response misses the point. Abbott is not being condemned for\r\n\
    what he believes, or for making his views plain, but for playing fast\r\n\
    and loose with the facts: a problem that his status as Federal Minister\r\n\
    for Health arguably makes worse.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Exaggerating, sensationalising, decontextualising, misconstruing,\r\n\
    mischaracterizing and misleading are all variations on the dishonesty\r\n\
    charge. In one case, there is a hair to split. In response to concerns\r\n\
    raised predominantly by pro-life groups that the demand for human eggs\r\n\
    left women vulnerable to exploitation, the Lockhart committee did\r\n\
    recommend a lifting of the ban on scientists pursuing the derivation of\r\n\
    embryonic stem cells from somatic cell nuclear transfer undertaken on\r\n\
    animal eggs. However, the recommendation clearly stipulates that such\r\n\
    embryos \xE2\x80\x9Cnot [be] implanted into the body of a woman or allowed to\r\n\
    develop for more than 14 days.\xE2\x80\x9D Hardly the living and breathing\r\n\
    Transylvanian chimera evoked by the Health Minister\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Chuman animal\r\n\
    hybrid\xE2\x80\x9D claim.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But charges of inaccuracy must be upheld for the remainder of the\r\n\
    Minister\xE2\x80\x99s remarks. In fact, clarifications on the point the Minister\r\n\
    fudged with regard to pregnancy counselling were repeatedly offered\r\n\
    during hearings into the bill conducted around the nation last month.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Some may see such criticism as beside the point. Isn\xE2\x80\x99t the Health\r\n\
    Minister\xE2\x80\x99s only crime his willingness to be more open and honest than\r\n\
    other politicians about this passions and biases? Surely, given the\r\n\
    chance, all politicians attempt to shape law and policy to fit their\r\n\
    ideals. Why else pursue power?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This is true to a point. But use and abuse of power are two different\r\n\
    things. Telling fibs to discredit one\xE2\x80\x99s opponents and their case for\r\n\
    change, not to mention relying on the prestige of high office to bolster\r\n\
    one\xE2\x80\x99s falsehoods, is just not cricket. Rather, it is a condemnable\r\n\
    means-to-an-end strategy that disregards the rules for fair play in the\r\n\
    service of winning at all costs.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Further, those who operate in this fashion rule themselves out of the\r\n\
    role of honest broker in the event that their preferred approach is not\r\n\
    the one delivered by democratic processes. This has been the case with\r\n\
    Abbott and the drug RU486. Having fought so hard, and at times unfairly,\r\n\
    to prevent the removal of his ministerial veto over women\xE2\x80\x99s access to\r\n\
    the drug (phrases like \xE2\x80\x9Cbackyard miscarriage\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cpop and forget\xE2\x80\x9D pill\r\n\
    peppered his contributions to the debate), significant questions hang\r\n\
    over his capacity to impartially oversee the post-conscience-vote\r\n\
    processes required to bring the drug to the market. In May, a\r\n\
    pharmaceutical company executive revealed that the Minister and his\r\n\
    office threatened his company with adverse consequences if it applied to\r\n\
    register the drug in Australia.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CThe thing I enjoy most as a politician,\xE2\x80\x9D Tony Abbott said recently, \xE2\x80\x9Cis\r\n\
    the opportunity to be taken seriously when you say something\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Too right. And with such power comes responsibility. Tony Abottt is no\r\n\
    fool. He\xE2\x80\x99s more than capable of getting across a brief, if this is what\r\n\
    he wishes to do. Minister Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s failure to get the facts right when\r\n\
    issues of gender, reproduction and sexuality are at stake undermines the\r\n\
    quality of public debate on such matters.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It also casts doubt not just on his fitness for high office, but the\r\n\
    wisdom of the man who keeps him there."

    summary of national identity includes phrases like sunburnt, rugged,\n\
    over-the-top and oafish, not necessarily in that order.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Irwin never claimed to represent Australia or Australians overseas, or\n\
    to in any way summarise how we think or who we are. The reality, which\n\
    he knew better than anyone, was that he was about as far from the\n\
    quintessential Australian as you could get: a bush dweller and\n\
    conservationist in a land of confirmed suburbanites indifferent to their\n\
    ever-expanding environmental footprints; a warp-speed extravert whose\n\

    tellingly to the preference of his compatriots for somewhat, rather and\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Ca bit\xE2\x80\x9D. In a telling interview with Andrew Denton in 2003, replayed on\n\
    ABC TV last night as a tribute, Irwin frankly acknowledged the\n\
    embarrassment he caused his compatriots. I\xE2\x80\x99m embarrassing, he explained\n\
    because \xE2\x80\x9Cthere\xE2\x80\x99s a little bit of me in everybody\xE2\x80\x9D. In addition, what\n\
    Irwin called the \xE2\x80\x9Cyeah, yeah, take it or leave it\xE2\x80\x9D attitude of Aussies\n\

    to keep it that way, for precisely the reasons Irwin nominates: our fear\n\
    of appearing too invested in or excited about anything. It\xE2\x80\x99s all\n\
    terribly English, really. Being so relaxed we\xE2\x80\x99re horizontal is a highly\n\
    esteemed Australian characteristic, and if the upshot of our commitment\n\
    to indifference is a loss of our own passion for the things that really\n\

  title: Burlesque evokes a repressive past, not a liberating present
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:49:30
  content_markup: "<p>Last Thursday, a number of female scientists stormed out of the dinner\n\
    of a government- funded conference on climate change. They were outraged\n\
    at the choice of a scantily-clad, all-woman burlesque troupe that\n\
    included one performer covered with balloons that conference\n\
    participants were invited to pop &ndash; as entertainment.</p>\n\n\
    <p>For the academic who drew the news media\xE2\x80\x99s attention to what one\n\
    attendee frankly described as \xE2\x80\x9Ca mess\xE2\x80\x9D, the problem was clear. \xE2\x80\x9CThis is\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA6 supposed to be a gathering of scientists at a government-sponsored\n\
    event in an already male-dominated industry where it is hard enough for\n\
    a woman to make inroads.\xE2\x80\x9D Her comments implied that in this context,\n\
    there was little that was amusing, and much that was damaging, in the\n\
    raucous display of semi-naked female bodies.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The fishnet-stockinged troupe leader Rebecca Gale, a.k.a \xE2\x80\x9CMiss Kitka\xE2\x80\x9D,\n\
    disagrees. Gale claims that burlesque is not \xE2\x80\x9Cas degrading and as\n\
    backward leading for women\xE2\x80\x9D as its critics claim. Not only had she\n\
    invited some of the \xE2\x80\x9Cladies\xE2\x80\x9D to pop her balloons, but the show\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    emphasis on tease rather than nudity, and the fact that all the\n\
    performers were neither 18 years old nor \xE2\x80\x9Cblonde with big boobs\xE2\x80\x9D proved\n\
    its non-sexist credentials.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Gale might also have pointed to the history of burlesque as further\n\
    evidence as its right-on credentials. Originating in the early Victorian\n\
    era when tensions between the aristocracy and working-class were high,\n\
    burlesque saw performers in outfits considered inappropriate for polite\n\
    society mock high-brow entertainment forms as opera, Shakespearean\n\
    drama, musicals, and ballet. However, just before the crackdown in the\n\
    1930s that saw the genre disappear, burlesque had been reduced to little\n\
    more than strip shows where young, rural, poverty-stricken gals got\n\
    their kit off for money. Revived as part of the retro- craze of the\n\
    1990s, its continued flourishing at the start of the 21st may be\n\
    attributable to the rise of \xE2\x80\x9Craunch\xE2\x80\x9D culture.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Is burlesque sexist? While there is little doubt that on some issues we\n\

    because like the charge of racism, sexism is not a trivial accusation,\n\
    but a highly charged moral one that stamps \xE2\x80\x9Coppressive\xE2\x80\x9D (burdensome,\n\
    arbitrary, unjust and/or tyrannical exercise of power) on the accused.\n\
    Those making such accusations, in other words, have an obligation to\n\

    <p>If any form of sexual entertainment is deemed inappropriate at all\n\
    serious work-related events, than in this context burlesque &ndash; as well as\n\

    sexual but sexist, than like minstrel shows in which white actors\n\
    blackened their faces and lampooned stereotypical depictions of blacks,\n\
    its suitability as entertainment in any context must be questioned.</p>\n\n\
    <p>With all due respect to Ms Gale, it is unclear to me why the fact that\n\
    female audience members received the same number of invitations to pop\n\
    her balloons defends against the charge of sexism. Would anyone\n\
    seriously argue that because the mothers often wrapped and unwrapped the\n\
    cloth that crippled their young daughters\xE2\x80\x99 feet, that the ancient\n\

    amending this aspect of our culture\xE2\x80\x99s eroticisation of women does not\n\
    necessarily, or on its own, empower us. As well, while the ways in which\n\
    women are constructed as hot or not matters, it must at least take equal\n\
    place beside the important feminist goal of defending a woman\xE2\x80\x99s right to\n\

    <p>Of course, for some women, the infiltration of burlesque, belly-dancing\n\

    that they are taken seriously as citizens and fully-rounded human beings\n\
    at home, at school and at work would dare to reintroduce dress and dance\n\
    forms that throughout history has been emblematic of the highly\n\
    constrained ways women had to arouse recognition, interest and approval\n\
    from men. Surely, some young women may feel, the creation of a world in\n\
    which women are free to introduce the all-too-human yen to be seen as\n\
    desirable in their everyday persona, without fear of misogynist\n\

  content: "Last Thursday, a number of female scientists stormed out of the dinner\r\n\
    of a government- funded conference on climate change. They were outraged\r\n\
    at the choice of a scantily-clad, all-woman burlesque troupe that\r\n\
    included one performer covered with balloons that conference\r\n\
    participants were invited to pop - as entertainment.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    For the academic who drew the news media\xE2\x80\x99s attention to what one\r\n\
    attendee frankly described as \xE2\x80\x9Ca mess\xE2\x80\x9D, the problem was clear. \xE2\x80\x9CThis is\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA6 supposed to be a gathering of scientists at a government-sponsored\r\n\
    event in an already male-dominated industry where it is hard enough for\r\n\
    a woman to make inroads.\xE2\x80\x9D Her comments implied that in this context,\r\n\
    there was little that was amusing, and much that was damaging, in the\r\n\
    raucous display of semi-naked female bodies.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The fishnet-stockinged troupe leader Rebecca Gale, a.k.a \xE2\x80\x9CMiss Kitka\xE2\x80\x9D,\r\n\
    disagrees. Gale claims that burlesque is not \xE2\x80\x9Cas degrading and as\r\n\
    backward leading for women\xE2\x80\x9D as its critics claim. Not only had she\r\n\
    invited some of the \xE2\x80\x9Cladies\xE2\x80\x9D to pop her balloons, but the show\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    emphasis on tease rather than nudity, and the fact that all the\r\n\
    performers were neither 18 years old nor \xE2\x80\x9Cblonde with big boobs\xE2\x80\x9D proved\r\n\
    its non-sexist credentials.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Gale might also have pointed to the history of burlesque as further\r\n\
    evidence as its right-on credentials. Originating in the early Victorian\r\n\
    era when tensions between the aristocracy and working-class were high,\r\n\
    burlesque saw performers in outfits considered inappropriate for polite\r\n\
    society mock high-brow entertainment forms as opera, Shakespearean\r\n\
    drama, musicals, and ballet. However, just before the crackdown in the\r\n\
    1930s that saw the genre disappear, burlesque had been reduced to little\r\n\
    more than strip shows where young, rural, poverty-stricken gals got\r\n\
    their kit off for money. Revived as part of the retro- craze of the\r\n\
    1990s, its continued flourishing at the start of the 21st may be\r\n\
    attributable to the rise of \xE2\x80\x9Craunch\xE2\x80\x9D culture.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Is burlesque sexist? While there is little doubt that on some issues we\r\n\
    can agree to disagree, I\xE2\x80\x99m unconvinced this is one of them. This is\r\n\
    because like the charge of racism, sexism is not a trivial accusation,\r\n\
    but a highly charged moral one that stamps \xE2\x80\x9Coppressive\xE2\x80\x9D (burdensome,\r\n\
    arbitrary, unjust and/or tyrannical exercise of power) on the accused.\r\n\
    Those making such accusations, in other words, have an obligation to\r\n\
    believe they have truth, not just opinion, on their side.\r\n\

    <p>Earlier this week Senator Amanda Vanstone re-opened the euthanasia\n\
    debate by opining in a newspaper interview that it was inhumane to\n\
    deprive Australians of \xE2\x80\x9Csane sensible and humane euthanasia laws\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The arguments the palliative care movement make against euthanasia are\n\
    similar to those made by the anti-choice movement against abortion. This\n\
    is unsurprising , given the religious origins of both schools of though\n\
    of late, both have taken what one scholar describes as a decidedly\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Csecular turn\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Both movements argue that the only reason why those they claim to\n\
    represent &ndash; women and terminally ill patients &ndash; choose as they do is\n\
    because both groups lack adequate knowledge of other alternatives. If\n\
    only woman knew about Centrelink parenting payments, and the terminally\n\
    ill recognised the improvements in pain management, the demand for\n\
    abortion and physician assisted suicide would disappear.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Both movements also question the decision-making competence of those\n\
    choosing abortion and physician-assisted suicide. Female pregnancy\n\
    hormones and the poor physical and mental health status of terminally\n\
    ill patients, not to mention the stress of crisis decision-making, are\n\
    deemed legitimate reasons to doubt the rationality &ndash; and disregard the\n\
    choices &ndash; of those pursuing control over their bodies and their deaths.\n\
    Palliative care providers, argues a recent article in Palliative\n\
    Medicine, deem all patients who \xE2\x80\x9Cthink that their life is irretrievably\n\
    bad\xE2\x80\x9D to be \xE2\x80\x9Cwrong\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Finally, both advocacy groups suggest that the availability of more\n\
    options has the counter-intuitive outcome of reducing choice. The mere\n\
    availability of abortion and physician-assisted suicide, the argument\n\
    runs, coerces women and terminally ill-patients to \xE2\x80\x9Cchoose it\xE2\x80\x9D so as to\n\
    avoid burdening others with their need. Real choice, it is claimed,\n\
    requires the continued criminalisation of abortion and\n\
    physician-assisted suicide so that more legitimate options like adoption\n\
    and palliative care can flourish.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So what is the truth? Surveys across the western world, including\n\
    Australia, clearly show support for a right to die. A 2002 Gallup poll\n\
    found 72% of Americans supported doctor-assisted suicide for those with\n\
    terminal illnesses, while in the same year 70% of Australians were found\n\
    to be in favour of giving terminally ill and severely suffering people a\n\
    choice about the timing and method of their death.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Data from Oregon suggests that the most frequently given reasons for\n\
    choosing physician-assisted suicide by the approximately 30 people who\n\
    die this way every year are loss of autonomy\" (87%), \xE2\x80\x9Closs of dignity\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    (80%) and \xE2\x80\x9Closs of the ability to enjoy the activities that make life\n\
    worth living\xE2\x80\x9D (84%). This data, which suggests that mental rather than\n\
    physical suffering is the main driver of decisions to die, undermines\n\
    the assertion of anti-euthanasia forces that the effectiveness of\n\
    modern-day palliative methods obviates the need for legal reform.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Such figures also undercut claims that the legal freedom to die would\n\
    exert the greatest coercive pressure on those lacking options other than\n\
    death: namely, the ill-educated and those too poor to afford palliative\n\
    care. The overwhelming majority of Oregonians seeking physician-assisted\n\
    suicide were highly educated and well off. Indeed, 86% were enrolled in\n\
    hospice care at the time of their suicides, while only 2 of the 208\n\
    people who have used the legislation so far were uninsured.</p>\n\n\
    <p>There are some values that palliative care and right to die advocates\n\

    process.</p>\n\n\
    <p>However, disagreements between the two groups are profound. They include\n\
    theoretical disputes about the legitimacy of death as a choice as well\n\
    as more empirically-based spats about the competence and capacity of the\n\
    terminally ill to make adequately informed decisions, and the likely\n\
    effect of making physician-assisted suicide a legal choice. Palliative\n\
    care advocates see decriminalisation as an invitation to what Melbourne\n\
    writer Juliette Hughes (Opinion, 13/7) recently described as a culture\n\
    of death that would enable the preferences of greedy relatives and\n\
    stingy hospital bureaucrats to be privileged above those of vulnerable\n\
    patients. In contrast, advocates for physician-assisted suicide believe\n\
    safeguards can be put in place to protect patient-autonomy and reduce\n\
    the risks of involuntary euthanasia: risks currently managed in\n\
    secretive and ad hoc ways. One survey found that while 30% of all\n\

    <p>TEASE: Do multiculturalism and feminism mix? What about feminism and\n\
    religious freedom?</p>\n\n\
    <p>One could be forgiven for having doubts. In a range of pluralist,\n\
    liberal states &ndash; Australia included &ndash; pockets of cultural and religious\n\
    minorities engage in practices that express limited views about the full\n\
    humanity of women, and undermine equity between the sexes. From the\n\
    insistence of pockets of Somali immigrants in the US on \xE2\x80\x9Ccircumcising\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    their infant girls, the refusal of parts of the Anglican and Catholic\n\
    Churches to ordain women and the appeal to customary law by some\n\
    Aboriginal men to justify child marriage and marital rape, some\n\
    religious and cultural sub-communities persevere with practices that\n\
    express particular views about \xE2\x80\x9Cproper\xE2\x80\x9D roles for women rejected &ndash; in\n\
    theory if not in practice &ndash; by the majority. When criticised, the\n\
    defence that tends to be offered, nearly always by a male authority\n\
    figure, is that what is being done is an inextricable part of \xE2\x80\x9Cour\n\
    culture\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The dilemma cannot be solved by a simple appeal to rights. This is\n\
    because the right to pursue one\xE2\x80\x99s own conception of the good life free\n\
    from discrimination on the grounds of culture and of gender are\n\
    important moral rights. Which should trump the other when they conflict?\n\
    Political rights are similarly impotent in the face of this conflict,\n\
    with many human rights conventions and anti-discrimination protocols\n\
    enshrining gender equity as well as freedom of culture and religion. The\n\
    seven core international human rights treaties, for example, include\n\
    those that guarantee the right of self determination to all without\n\
    regard to religion, as well as those that affirm the equal rights of men\n\
    and women.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So what should be done when the values we hold about cultural and\n\
    religious diversity, and our beliefs about equality between the sexes,\n\
    collide? A number of Australian politicians have recently made their\n\
    views clear. Members of minority cultures or religions can either do as\n\
    we do (or say we do) when it comes to gender equity, or go home. \xE2\x80\x9CIf a\n\
    person wants to live under Sharia law there are countries where they\n\
    might feel at ease\xE2\x80\x9D, Treasurer Peter Costello recently informed\n\
    Australia\xE2\x80\x99s Muslim minority. \xE2\x80\x9CBut not Australia\xE2\x80\x9D. In a speech to the\n\
    Sydney Institute earlier this year, Victorian MP Andrew Robb argued that\n\
    the successful integration of first and second generation Muslims into\n\
    Australia was dependant on these Australians \xE2\x80\x9Cdemonstrat[ing] their\n\
    comittment\xE2\x80\x9D to, among other things, the \xE2\x80\x9CAustralian value\xE2\x80\x9D of equality\n\
    between the sexes.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Some supporters of multiculturalism &ndash; many of whom are feminists &ndash; have\n\
    taken umbrage at such remarks, which have been interpreted as\n\
    thinly-veiled racism against Australian Muslims. Certainly it was the\n\
    first time many Australian feminists heard the fair, fat and fifty-ish\n\
    men who run the nation even mention the word feminism, little less in\n\
    such impassioned and unequivocal tones.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Yet, beneath this discomfort may have lurked another: one grounded in\n\
    the sure knowledge that however unjust the discrimination some minority\n\
    groups suffer (the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission handled\n\
    167 complaints of race discrimination in 2004~~05), such groups may also\n\
    perpetrate injustice~~ systematically and unapologetically &ndash; against\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Ctheir\xE2\x80\x9D girls and women. Whether it\xE2\x80\x99s Muslim parents forcing their\n\
    daughters overseas for an arranged marriage with an (often far older)\n\
    co-religionist, Orthodox Jewish males thanking God daily for not making\n\
    them women, or leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention instructing\n\
    female congregants to \xE2\x80\x9Csubmit themselves graciously to the servant\n\
    leadership of their husbands\xE2\x80\x9D and accept their ordained role of\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cmanaging the household and nurturing the next generation,\xE2\x80\x9D culture and\n\
    religion are regularly used as defences for practices that demean,\n\
    deprive, limit and otherwise oppress women.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Ironically, at the same time as girls and women are burdened by the\n\
    patriarchal attitudes of traditional religious and cultural communities,\n\
    they are also seen as responsible for their preservation and\n\
    perpetuation. According to one American study, the parents of young\n\
    migrant women saw their daughters as more responsible than their sons\n\
    for the positive representation and perpetuation of their culture and\n\
    consequently legitimately subject to parental control when it came to\n\
    what they wore, their participation in extracurricular and social\n\
    activities, their future choices about education and employment and even\n\
    their decisions about when and who to marry. While some girls openly or\n\
    covertly flouted such restrictions, others submitted, despite what they\n\
    admitted were high psychic, social and/or material costs. Philosopher\n\
    Susan Okin tells a story of an Indian student facing a forced marriage\n\
    that would preclude her graduation from high school. While the 17-year\n\
    old admitted that her parents\xE2\x80\x99 decision had \xE2\x80\x9Cmessed up\xE2\x80\x9D her dreams and\n\
    plans, leaving her \xE2\x80\x9Ctormented\xE2\x80\x9D, she bristled at her teacher\xE2\x80\x99s suggestion\n\
    that she might resist. \xE2\x80\x9CIn our religion, we have to think of our parents\n\
    first\xE2\x80\xA6I will do it the Muslim way\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>For Okin, arguably the 20th century\xE2\x80\x99s most eminent female philosopher,\n\
    one solution to the clash between feminism and multiculturalism is to\n\
    ensure female members of religious sub-groups have what she calls\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Crealistic rights of exit\xE2\x80\x9D. Liberal pluralist societies like Australia\n\
    should only tolerate the rights of minority groups to discriminate\n\
    against women when those women are truly free to respond to such\n\
    discrimination &ndash; and the more limited life aspirations and achievements\n\
    they entail &ndash; to leave the group, and build an alterative life\n\
    elsewhere. Small-l liberal states that do not guarantee this freedom to\n\
    all their citizens are guilty of failing to protect women\xE2\x80\x99s moral right\n\
    to choice and control over their lives.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But the right to escape a community that is oppressive is not enough.\n\
    Gender-discriminatory cultures and religions have a profound impact on\n\
    women\xE2\x80\x99s beliefs about their legitimate entitlements in this life. If\n\
    girls grow up hearing, as they do if they attend some private\n\
    fundamentalist Christian schools, that their failure to accept a\n\
    subordinate and obedient role in the home leaves the \xE2\x80\x9Cdoors open to\n\
    Satan\xE2\x80\x9D, their opportunities to exit are significantly undermined. This\n\
    is because, to rephrase the Rocky Horror Show\xE2\x80\x99s Dr. Frank-N-Furter, if\n\
    you can\xE2\x80\x99t see it, you can\xE2\x80\x99t be it. As a consequence, asserts Okin, where\n\
    multicultural practices eviscerate the self-esteem necessary for girls\n\
    and women to develop their own values and plans, the State is well\n\
    within its bounds to outlaw them. This is particularly the case because\n\
    the alternative &ndash; that oppressed women can either \xE2\x80\x9Clump it or leave\xE2\x80\x9D &ndash;\n\
    not only deprives women of the opportunity to participate in and enjoy\n\
    the positive aspects of their cultures, it more or less ensures the\n\
    entrenchment in such cultures of gender-oppressive attitudes and\n\
    behaviour. After all, if the women who object to them have no other\n\
    option but to leave, it\xE2\x80\x99s hard to see from where the force for change\n\
    will come.</p>\n\n\
    <p>An emphasis not just on the obligation of liberal states to equip girls\n\
    and women from minority cultures to exit, but to ensure the conditions\n\
    exist for them to stay, is likely to draw fierce resistance from some\n\
    minority cultural and religious groups. The leaders of such groups may\n\
    brand as culturally imperialist claims that particular practices (like\n\
    distinctive and highly restrictive female dress and education\n\
    emphasising traditional gender roles and sexual morality) are oppressive\n\
    to women, and insist that \xE2\x80\x9Ctheir\xE2\x80\x9D women freely choose to engage in them.\n\
    Where practices less open to interpretation are at issue &ndash; like female\n\
    genital mutilation, or forced child marriages &ndash; they may argue that\n\
    cultural expression and survival must take priority over gender\n\
    equality.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Philosopher Ayelet Shachar has observed that \xE2\x80\x9Ca disproportionate share\n\
    of the costs of multiculturalism\xE2\x80\x9D is born by the most vulnerable groups\n\
    in the community: children, women and homosexuals. Shachar\xE2\x80\x99s point,\n\
    obvious but often overlooked, is that minority cultural and religious\n\
    groups are not homogeneous, but comprise less and more powerful members.\n\
    This is something to keep in mind when the most powerful members insist\n\
    on majority toleration of a practice that results in the least powerful\n\
    copping it sweet.</p>\n\n\
    <p>A focus on exit rights, and the conditions necessary to stay, is not\n\
    really as radical as it may sound. When we insist that that the\n\
    perpetrators of domestic violence, not the victims, leave the family\n\
    home, or applaud court decisions that prohibit religious schools from\n\
    firing married women because of their view that they belong at home, we\n\
    endorse an Okin-esque view that a truly just society doesn\xE2\x80\x99t just\n\
    support its citizens to escape injustice by leaving, but helps them to\n\
    fight it, so they can stay.</p>\n\n\

  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:49:14
  content_markup: "<p><em>Airing a dream is to criticise and negate the opposing vision</em></p>\n\n\
    <p>Ah, the good old F-word. For a while, things were looking grim. All that\n\
    talk about irrelevance, betrayal of the young, even death. No one but\n\
    the humourless hirsute holed up in the hallowed halls of\n\
    higher-education had a good word to say about her.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Now our dear old F-word is back, though the revolutionary being returned\n\
    to us as a topic of decent conversation is not the gal we knew. She\xE2\x80\x99s a\n\
    kindler, gentler revolutionary with fewer enemies than a nun. She\xE2\x80\x99s the\n\
    New Feminism, a social movement that no longer causes discomfort or\n\
    division by identifying female oppression or fighting to change the way\n\
    the world is organised. The New Feminism speaks only in muted tones\n\
    about how all women\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cchoices\xE2\x80\x9D must be respected.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The problem with New Feminism is that social movements must actually\n\
    stand for something. Barracking for one vision of the good is to be\n\
    opposed to its opposite. For something to be right, fair or good,\n\
    something else must (at least in theory and arguably in practice) be\n\
    wrong, unfair or bad. Second wave feminists weren\xE2\x80\x99t backwards about\n\
    coming forward with their views that attitudes and practices when it\n\
    came to paid work and the care of children discriminated and oppressed\n\
    women and were therefore wrong. It was on the basis of these unambiguous\n\
    moral assertions that their demands for change were founded. It was also\n\
    on this basis that opposition formed amongst those who disagreed with\n\
    feminist descriptions of the problem, the movement\xE2\x80\x99s preferred\n\
    solutions, or both.</p>\n\n\

    \r\n\
    Ah, the good old F-word. For a while, things were looking grim. All that\r\n\
    talk about irrelevance, betrayal of the young, even death. No one but\r\n\
    the humourless hirsute holed up in the hallowed halls of\r\n\
    higher-education had a good word to say about her.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Now our dear old F-word is back, though the revolutionary being returned\r\n\
    to us as a topic of decent conversation is not the gal we knew. She\xE2\x80\x99s a\r\n\
    kindler, gentler revolutionary with fewer enemies than a nun. She\xE2\x80\x99s the\r\n\
    New Feminism, a social movement that no longer causes discomfort or\r\n\
    division by identifying female oppression or fighting to change the way\r\n\
    the world is organised. The New Feminism speaks only in muted tones\r\n\
    about how all women\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cchoices\xE2\x80\x9D must be respected.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The problem with New Feminism is that social movements must actually\r\n\
    stand for something. Barracking for one vision of the good is to be\r\n\
    opposed to its opposite. For something to be right, fair or good,\r\n\
    something else must (at least in theory and arguably in practice) be\r\n\
    wrong, unfair or bad. Second wave feminists weren\xE2\x80\x99t backwards about\r\n\
    coming forward with their views that attitudes and practices when it\r\n\
    came to paid work and the care of children discriminated and oppressed\r\n\
    women and were therefore wrong. It was on the basis of these unambiguous\r\n\
    moral assertions that their demands for change were founded. It was also\r\n\
    on this basis that opposition formed amongst those who disagreed with\r\n\
    feminist descriptions of the problem, the movement\xE2\x80\x99s preferred\r\n\
    solutions, or both.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Choice, as the forgoing should make clear, didn\xE2\x80\x99t enter it. This is not\r\n\
    to say that choice is not a legitimate part of what feminism is about in\r\n\
    some instances. In particular, when it\xE2\x80\x99s possible for everyone to have\r\n\

    Australians who complained that their church was denying them leadership\r\n\
    positions and demanding they sit in pews at the back? Or would we feel\r\n\
    that Aborigines have a right to membership in a church free of\r\n\
    institutionalised racism.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Sexism is just as eviscerating to the dignity, self-esteem, aspirations\r\n\
    and opportunities of women as racism is to people of colour. It was the\r\n\
    recognition of this fact that led to the passage of the Federal Sex\r\n\
    Discrimination Act in 1984. More than 20 years later, it is high time\r\n\
    its provisions were fully enforced."

    sudden onslaught of rape charges. Of course, I support a woman\xE2\x80\x99s right\n\
    to raise her grievances publicly and have them addressed in a legitimate\n\
    forum, but I worry that others might not. The men being named are\n\
    sporting heroes, and it wasn\xE2\x80\x99t all that long ago that author Helen\n\
    Garner questioned the legitimacy of young women bringing charges of\n\
    sexual assault, both because of serious damage the resulting publicity\n\
    had on the man\xE2\x80\x99s reputation, and because she felt it was the job of\n\
    young women to take responsibility for the effect their sexuality had on\n\
    the opposite sex.</p>\n\n\
    <p>For those feeling cynical about the sudden onslaught of allegations, it\n\
    is critical to understand that \xE2\x80\x9Cdate-rape\xE2\x80\x9D charges come in waves for\n\
    good reason. Unless they have been violated by a bush-leaping,\n\
    balaclava-clad stranger, women tend to doubt themselves when it comes to\n\
    labelling a disturbing, violative or even abusive sexual encounter as\n\
    assault. Was it really rape, they wonder, if I flirted with the guy\n\
    earlier than evening, was drinking, had a short skirt on, consented to\n\
    all forms of petting short of intercourse?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Even if they are savvy enough to know that no one &ndash; no matter what she\n\
    said, wore or did &ndash; asks to be raped, they may worry others will\n\
    disbelieve their story, or claim that they did. This is where other\n\
    women speaking out is critical. When others tell their story and have\n\
    their complaints taken seriously, those keeping silent gain the courage\n\
    to speak, too.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The media, police, and the clubs deserve credit, in other words (with\n\
    the exception of St Kilda, who having spoken only to the two accused\n\
    have now publicly declared themselves 100% behind their \xE2\x80\x9Cboys\xE2\x80\x9D) for\n\
    responding appropriately to the women\xE2\x80\x99s charges, and therefore\n\
    encouraging other women to emerge from the shadows.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But the avalanche of accusations has another cause too, one which I\n\
    think testifies to the success of feminism, and bodes well for gender\n\
    relations in the future. Many of the women making charges against\n\
    players are from Generation X and even Y &ndash; young women in their twenties\n\
    and thirties &ndash; who see as their birthright to either receive respect\n\
    from the opposite sex, or to demand it. These confident, assertive women\n\
    have come of age with the knowledge that no man has the right to use\n\
    either his advantage in strength or power to disadvantage her; either in\n\
    the bedroom or the office. When men do abuse either, they see little\n\
    problem in bringing them to account.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It is hard to see how such forthright attitudes from young women, if\n\
    widespread and sustained enough, will not fundamentally alter the\n\
    behaviour of young men. After all, the whole reason gender relations are\n\
    so fraught is that men and women want and need each other: they want and\n\
    need each other in bed, to build the long-term intimate relationships so\n\
    fundamental to their emotional well-being, and to form and raise\n\
    families. This means that when one gender change the rules, the other &ndash;\n\
    no matter how much they moan and complain &ndash; has little choice but to\n\
    adjust their ways. If women won\xE2\x80\x99t sleep with or marry men until they are\n\
    treated with respect on all relevant turfs, in other words, then men\n\
    will start seeing their role in the attainment of equality for women as\n\
    a bread and butter issue.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Renegotiated power relations between the sexes are to be welcomed, to a\n\
    point. While Australians rightly don\xE2\x80\x99t want to wind up where many\n\
    American college men felt they were during the 1990s &ndash; needing a signed\n\
    consent form before they could safely have sex with a woman &ndash; we do want\n\
    all sexual engagements to be conducted with an awareness not only of the\n\
    exciting and unpredictable frisson of Eros, but of the potential that\n\
    unequal power and intoxication has for causing misunderstanding, and the\n\
    importance of mutual respect, open communication and excellent listening\n\
    skills.</p>\n\n\
    <p>When men understand that women who bring their stories of abuse into the\n\
    open will be heard, it will go a long way to redress the power imbalance\n\
    in sexual encounters. This will particularly be the case in\n\

  title: It Matters Who You Are, and Where You Come From
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:55:17
  content_markup: "<p>Should arguments stand or fall on their merit? Or is it critical that\n\
    media consumers get full, accurate and relevant information about who is\n\
    providing facts, or offering opinion, about matters of public interest?.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It may be nice to think the quality of ideas &ndash; not those who promulgate\n\
    them determines their persuasiveness, but the reality is more\n\
    complicated. A pro- nuclear argument made by a mining magnate will be\n\
    evaluated differently to the exact same one made by an environmental\n\
    activist, professor of nuclear physics, or the CEO of International\n\
    Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War.</p>\n\n\
    <p>And rightly so. The credentials of individuals and organsisations\n\
    provide us with important clues about the expertise and motives of those\n\
    seeking to influence us. They give us the chance to evaluate for\n\
    ourselves whether an individual or organisation\xE2\x80\x99s contribution is\n\
    influenced by memberships, affiliations or sources of funding and, if we\n\
    believe it is, to adjust the weight we give to those views accordingly.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Motivations are complex and hidden. Political parties regularly discount\n\
    the possibility that corporate donors purchase influence over party\n\
    policies. Thinktanks poo-poo the idea that their spiritual or financial\n\
    relationships with religious, political or corporate donors influence\n\
    their views on matters of public interest, insisting that instead donors\n\
    simply give to those who share their views.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But unless full, accurate and relevant information on these\n\
    relationships are disclosed, how can we make up our own minds?</p>\n\n\
    <p>We can\xE2\x80\x99t. And the truth is that some who seek to influence us believe\n\
    that some ways of identifying themselves increase the credibility of\n\
    their message. Regrettably, on the basis of this belief, some provide\n\
    credentials and make disclosures that are at incomplete, misleading or\n\
    irrelevant.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Editorial space is preferred over advertising space by those who want to\n\
    get their message across, as was clearly revealed by the Cash for\n\
    Comment saga. The reason is simple. The views of journalists, academics,\n\
    scientists and doctors are presumed to be the consequence of sustained\n\
    and dispassionate analysis, not prior commitments, loyalties or the hope\n\
    of financial advantage. This impartiality gives credibility to their\n\
    views unavailable to those with known religious, corporate or political\n\
    commitments, or who stand to make money from opinion being shaped one\n\
    way instead of another.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This may explain why some organizations choose scholarly sounding names\n\
    like \xE2\x80\x9Ccentres\xE2\x80\x9D, \xE2\x80\x9Cinstitutes\xE2\x80\x9D and &ldquo;think-tanks, The reality, however, is\n\
    that unlike academics, the staff of such organizations will not be\n\
    required to have advanced degrees, nor adhere to the rigorous standards\n\
    for quality research required to publish in academic journals.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Many think-tanks are reticent about disclosing who funds them, and their\n\
    employees can be slack in ensuring past political affiliations are a\n\
    consistent feature of their bios. We do know that Philip Morris and BAT\n\
    donated to the Institute of Public Affairs, which takes the view that\n\
    passive smoking is not based on science. Director of the Sydney\n\
    Institute, Gerard Henderson does not always disclose, when he opines\n\
    about the Australian political scene, that he spent two years as John\n\

  content: "Should arguments stand or fall on their merit? Or is it critical that\r\n\
    media consumers get full, accurate and relevant information about who is\r\n\
    providing facts, or offering opinion, about matters of public interest?.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It may be nice to think the quality of ideas - not those who promulgate\r\n\
    them determines their persuasiveness, but the reality is more\r\n\
    complicated. A pro- nuclear argument made by a mining magnate will be\r\n\
    evaluated differently to the exact same one made by an environmental\r\n\
    activist, professor of nuclear physics, or the CEO of International\r\n\
    Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    And rightly so. The credentials of individuals and organsisations\r\n\
    provide us with important clues about the expertise and motives of those\r\n\
    seeking to influence us. They give us the chance to evaluate for\r\n\
    ourselves whether an individual or organisation\xE2\x80\x99s contribution is\r\n\
    influenced by memberships, affiliations or sources of funding and, if we\r\n\
    believe it is, to adjust the weight we give to those views accordingly.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Motivations are complex and hidden. Political parties regularly discount\r\n\
    the possibility that corporate donors purchase influence over party\r\n\
    policies. Thinktanks poo-poo the idea that their spiritual or financial\r\n\
    relationships with religious, political or corporate donors influence\r\n\
    their views on matters of public interest, insisting that instead donors\r\n\
    simply give to those who share their views.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But unless full, accurate and relevant information on these\r\n\
    relationships are disclosed, how can we make up our own minds?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    We can\xE2\x80\x99t. And the truth is that some who seek to influence us believe\r\n\
    that some ways of identifying themselves increase the credibility of\r\n\
    their message. Regrettably, on the basis of this belief, some provide\r\n\
    credentials and make disclosures that are at incomplete, misleading or\r\n\
    irrelevant.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Editorial space is preferred over advertising space by those who want to\r\n\
    get their message across, as was clearly revealed by the Cash for\r\n\
    Comment saga. The reason is simple. The views of journalists, academics,\r\n\
    scientists and doctors are presumed to be the consequence of sustained\r\n\
    and dispassionate analysis, not prior commitments, loyalties or the hope\r\n\
    of financial advantage. This impartiality gives credibility to their\r\n\
    views unavailable to those with known religious, corporate or political\r\n\
    commitments, or who stand to make money from opinion being shaped one\r\n\
    way instead of another.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This may explain why some organizations choose scholarly sounding names\r\n\
    like \xE2\x80\x9Ccentres\xE2\x80\x9D, \xE2\x80\x9Cinstitutes\xE2\x80\x9D and \"think-tanks, The reality, however, is\r\n\
    that unlike academics, the staff of such organizations will not be\r\n\
    required to have advanced degrees, nor adhere to the rigorous standards\r\n\
    for quality research required to publish in academic journals.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Many think-tanks are reticent about disclosing who funds them, and their\r\n\
    employees can be slack in ensuring past political affiliations are a\r\n\
    consistent feature of their bios. We do know that Philip Morris and BAT\r\n\
    donated to the Institute of Public Affairs, which takes the view that\r\n\
    passive smoking is not based on science. Director of the Sydney\r\n\
    Institute, Gerard Henderson does not always disclose, when he opines\r\n\
    about the Australian political scene, that he spent two years as John\r\n\
    Howard\xE2\x80\x99s chief of staff.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Academic gloss is not the only quality sought by those seeking\r\n\
    influence. A connection with the \xE2\x80\x9Clittle guy\xE2\x80\x9D - community-based or\r\n\
    grass-roots activists - also lends credibility to messages the big end\r\n\

  content_markup: "<p>Is stem cell science really anti-woman? Can anyone who truly believes in\n\
    the right of women to be treated as rational citizens deserving of the\n\
    same rights and opportunities as men campaign against the science on the\n\
    grounds that women lack the capacity to give informed consent to egg\n\
    donation?</p>\n\n\
    <p>The answer to both questions is \xE2\x80\x9Cno\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Yet these are precisely the claims made by Katrina George, the director\n\
    of Women\xE2\x80\x99s Forum Australia (WFA), in her piece last Thursday 2/11/06.</p>\n\n\
    <p>George argued that because advances in stem cell research require\n\
    women\xE2\x80\x99s eggs, women would be pressured to act against their own\n\
    self-interest and to donate them. Because egg donation is risky, and\n\
    because women are &ndash; quite literally &ndash; incapable of saying \xE2\x80\x9Cno\xE2\x80\x9D ,, the\n\
    only solution to the potential for exploitation is to ban the technology\n\
    all together.</p>\n\n\
    <p>None of these claims withstand scrutiny.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The aim of embryonic stem cell research is to gain knowledge about\n\
    pluripotent cells, those capable of becoming any tissue in the body.\n\
    Scientists are hopeful that such cells will help us develop treatments\n\
    for currently incurable conditions like motor neuron disease,\n\
    Alzheimer\xE2\x80\x99s and the sorts of spinal cord injuries suffered by the late\n\
    actor Christopher Reeves. Pluripotent cells may one day allow us to\n\
    produce blood, and grow organs like hearts and livers that &ndash; because\n\
    they are genetically matched to the patient &ndash; will eliminate the need\n\
    for anti-rejection drugs.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The crux of George\xE2\x80\x99s claim is that this research cannot be done without\n\
    eggs, and this means that women will be coerced into donating them. The\n\
    solution she proposes is to ban the technologies in Australia, despite\n\
    her knowledge that stem cell research will continue in places like the\n\
    UK, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Finland and Spain.</p>\n\n\
    <p>How will such coercion happen? In a submission opposing the passage of\n\
    legislation designed to allow Australian scientists greater freedom to\n\
    pursue stem cell cures, WFA said that if eggs are allowed to be sold,\n\
    poor women will have no choice but to donate against their will.</p>\n\n\
    <p>A valid claim, except for the fact that the legislation &ndash; to be debated\n\
    in the Senate next week &ndash; explicitly prohibits the sale of eggs, sperms\n\
    or embryos. Those guilty of inducing egg donation by offers of cash, a\n\
    discount on treatment or even giving priority in the provision of\n\
    service risk up to 10 years in jail.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Women\xE2\x80\x99s Forum Australia also claims that women will be coerced into\n\
    donating by their desire to be seen as \xE2\x80\x9Cgood women\xE2\x80\x9D. Their submission\n\

  content: "Is stem cell science really anti-woman? Can anyone who truly believes in\r\n\
    the right of women to be treated as rational citizens deserving of the\r\n\
    same rights and opportunities as men campaign against the science on the\r\n\
    grounds that women lack the capacity to give informed consent to egg\r\n\
    donation?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The answer to both questions is \xE2\x80\x9Cno\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Yet these are precisely the claims made by Katrina George, the director\r\n\
    of Women\xE2\x80\x99s Forum Australia (WFA), in her piece last Thursday 2/11/06.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    George argued that because advances in stem cell research require\r\n\
    women\xE2\x80\x99s eggs, women would be pressured to act against their own\r\n\
    self-interest and to donate them. Because egg donation is risky, and\r\n\
    because women are - quite literally - incapable of saying \xE2\x80\x9Cno\xE2\x80\x9D ,, the\r\n\
    only solution to the potential for exploitation is to ban the technology\r\n\
    all together.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    None of these claims withstand scrutiny.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The aim of embryonic stem cell research is to gain knowledge about\r\n\
    pluripotent cells, those capable of becoming any tissue in the body.\r\n\
    Scientists are hopeful that such cells will help us develop treatments\r\n\
    for currently incurable conditions like motor neuron disease,\r\n\
    Alzheimer\xE2\x80\x99s and the sorts of spinal cord injuries suffered by the late\r\n\
    actor Christopher Reeves. Pluripotent cells may one day allow us to\r\n\
    produce blood, and grow organs like hearts and livers that - because\r\n\
    they are genetically matched to the patient - will eliminate the need\r\n\
    for anti-rejection drugs.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The crux of George\xE2\x80\x99s claim is that this research cannot be done without\r\n\
    eggs, and this means that women will be coerced into donating them. The\r\n\
    solution she proposes is to ban the technologies in Australia, despite\r\n\
    her knowledge that stem cell research will continue in places like the\r\n\
    UK, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Finland and Spain.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    How will such coercion happen? In a submission opposing the passage of\r\n\
    legislation designed to allow Australian scientists greater freedom to\r\n\
    pursue stem cell cures, WFA said that if eggs are allowed to be sold,\r\n\
    poor women will have no choice but to donate against their will.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    A valid claim, except for the fact that the legislation - to be debated\r\n\
    in the Senate next week - explicitly prohibits the sale of eggs, sperms\r\n\
    or embryos. Those guilty of inducing egg donation by offers of cash, a\r\n\
    discount on treatment or even giving priority in the provision of\r\n\
    service risk up to 10 years in jail.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Women\xE2\x80\x99s Forum Australia also claims that women will be coerced into\r\n\
    donating by their desire to be seen as \xE2\x80\x9Cgood women\xE2\x80\x9D. Their submission\r\n\
    says that \xE2\x80\x9Csocial and cultural expectations of feminine self-sacriifice\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    will lead women to \xE2\x80\x9Csacrifice their own interests, and assume the health\r\n\
    risks of ova extraction for the sake of others\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In fact, women already donate eggs. In 2003 196 Victorian women gave\r\n\
    their eggs to women they knew, although a small number donated to\r\n\
    strangers.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Is Women\xE2\x80\x99s Forum Australia saying these women didn\xE2\x80\x99t really choose to\r\n\
    make such donations, but were simply trying to look like \xE2\x80\x9Cgood women\xE2\x80\x9D in\r\n\
    the eyes of others? If such altruism should be banned when it comes to\r\n\
    stem cell science, shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t women be prohibited from donating eggs to\r\n\
    women facing infertility, too?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Women also donate blood, though this - like all medical procedures -\r\n\
    carries risks. Should the state also step in here and say \xE2\x80\x9Cno\xE2\x80\x9D?\r\n\

    sister suffering infertility or to a stem cell research project\r\n\
    attempting to cure a disease from which we, or a beloved child, suffers?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The answer is infantilized, patronized, and mad as hell. If George\r\n\

    the age of the child, anger, blame, impotence and guilt may accompany\n\

    sadness, resentment, bitterness, hopelessness and depression.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The essential task of a parent, alongside teaching and loving their\n\
    children is protecting them. This may lead some parents to react to\n\

    account of the cause of death, a full explanation of any mistakes made,\n\
    and reassurance that systems have changed to avoid the recurrence of\n\
    such problems is critical to the success of their healing journey.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Judy Kovco\xE2\x80\x99s public journey of grief and truth-seeking has laid bare the\n\
    tragedy and as yet unresolved questions surrounding her son Jake\xE2\x80\x99s death\n\
    in Iraq in April. A claimed leak earlier this week of the military board\n\
    of inquiry\xE2\x80\x99s conclusion that Jake Kovco died of an unintentional\n\
    self-inflicted gunshot wound may be one more example of the military\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    mishandling of the incident and its aftermath.</p>\n\n\
    <p>If this does turn out to be the board\xE2\x80\x99s conclusion about how Jake Kovco\n\
    died, it is not the one his mother wants to hear. From the moment last\n\
    April when the Defence Minister wrongly informed the public that Kovco\n\
    was shot in the head while cleaning his gun &ndash; a mishap followed in short\n\
    order by the military\xE2\x80\x99s mistaken repatriation of a Bosnian carpenter to\n\
    Australia, and the loss in Melbourne airport of the draft report into\n\
    this bungle &ndash; Judy has campaigned for the truth to be told about her\n\
    son\xE2\x80\x99s death. Commenting on the lost report she noted that it would not\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cbring my son back\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Ctell\xE2\x80\xA6me what happened to my son. That\xE2\x80\x99s what I\n\
    want to know.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Judy Kovco\xE2\x80\x99s approach and response to the military board of inquiry,\n\
    however, point to some long-held suspicions. The separate counsel she\n\
    and husband Martin engaged to represent them at the hearing made the\n\
    point as far back as July this year that, \xE2\x80\x9CThere are three people that\n\
    had access to that firearm\xE2\x80\x9D. In response to police evidence at the\n\
    inquiry that Jake\xE2\x80\x99s lethal injury was self-inflicted, Judy is reported\n\
    to have shouted \xE2\x80\x9CKeystone Kops!\xE2\x80\x9D before leaving the room. Not long\n\
    after, she appeared on TV implying that bungled repatriation of Jake\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    body was the consequence of a face-saving military cover-up. She said\n\
    there was \xE2\x80\x9Cno way known\xE2\x80\x9D that Jake would have shot himself purposely or\n\
    accidentally, and that she would fight to obtain the truth for her son\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cforever\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In response to this week\xE2\x80\x99s purported leak of the board\xE2\x80\x99s forthcoming\n\
    conclusions, Judy questioned the basis of any conclusion that Jake shot\n\
    himself, and the trustworthiness of any investigation resulting in that\n\
    conclusion. \xE2\x80\x9CThis was the army investigating the army\xE2\x80\x9D, she said, adding\n\
    that she has asked for a separate coronial inquiry. \xE2\x80\x9CI know what I have\n\
    to do for Jake. I will fight for Jake and I will fight for the truth\xE2\x80\xA6I\xE2\x80\x99m\n\
    his mother and I will fight for him\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>What are we to make of Judy Kovco\xE2\x80\x99s pursuit of another investigation\n\
    into the final moments of Private Jake Kovco?</p>\n\n\
    <p>On the one hand, she seems to have formed a view early on in the piece &ndash;\n\
    while still in the early stages of shock and grief &ndash; that someone other\n\
    than Jake may have caused the gun to discharge. In September, months\n\
    after retaining separate counsel that pursued this line of inquiry, she\n\
    told a reporter that she was still in \xE2\x80\x9Ccomplete shock\xE2\x80\x9D from the death.\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CI still haven\xE2\x80\x99t come to grips with the fact that he\xE2\x80\x99s gone\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Has Judy Kovco imagined the bogey-men with whom she must do battle in\n\
    defence of her dead son, perhaps as a way of managing the terrible grief\n\
    a parent experiences on the death of a beloved child? Is her desire to\n\
    protect her son\xE2\x80\x99s reputation from post-mortem slurs on his\n\
    professionalism blinding her to the weight of evidence about what really\n\
    happened?</p>\n\n\
    <p>On the other hand, Judy Kovco is only pointing out what is undeniably\n\
    true: that significant questions remain unanswered about the manner of\n\
    Jake\xE2\x80\x99s death, and the way the military managed and investigated it. They\n\
    include queries about how the DNA of one of the soldiers with Kovco at\n\
    the time wound up on Jake\xE2\x80\x99s gun; why the military failed to seal the\n\
    room after the incident, allowing Kovco\xE2\x80\x99s clothes to be destroyed, and\n\
    the clothes and bodies of the soldiers present to be washed (destroying\n\
    potential forensic evidence); and the reason for the delayed military\n\
    police interviews of Kovco\xE2\x80\x99s two roommates and others in the unit,\n\
    allowing the soldiers to get together and talk about the event. As the\n\
    profile of the case grew, questions must also be asked about the wisdom\n\
    of the military\xE2\x80\x99s insistence on investigating itself, a decision that\n\
    former justice George Hampel says inspires a \xE2\x80\x9Cperception that they will\n\
    look after their own\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Conspiracy or cock-up? Grief-blinded mother or whistle-blower? Without\n\
    an independent investigation of the entire affair, we may never know.</p>\n"

    in Iraq in April. A claimed leak earlier this week of the military board\r\n\
    of inquiry\xE2\x80\x99s conclusion that Jake Kovco died of an unintentional\r\n\
    self-inflicted gunshot wound may be one more example of the military\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    mishandling of the incident and its aftermath.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    If this does turn out to be the board\xE2\x80\x99s conclusion about how Jake Kovco\r\n\
    died, it is not the one his mother wants to hear. From the moment last\r\n\
    April when the Defence Minister wrongly informed the public that Kovco\r\n\
    was shot in the head while cleaning his gun - a mishap followed in short\r\n\
    order by the military\xE2\x80\x99s mistaken repatriation of a Bosnian carpenter to\r\n\
    Australia, and the loss in Melbourne airport of the draft report into\r\n\
    this bungle - Judy has campaigned for the truth to be told about her\r\n\
    son\xE2\x80\x99s death. Commenting on the lost report she noted that it would not\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cbring my son back\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Ctell\xE2\x80\xA6me what happened to my son. That\xE2\x80\x99s what I\r\n\
    want to know.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Judy Kovco\xE2\x80\x99s approach and response to the military board of inquiry,\r\n\
    however, point to some long-held suspicions. The separate counsel she\r\n\
    and husband Martin engaged to represent them at the hearing made the\r\n\
    point as far back as July this year that, \xE2\x80\x9CThere are three people that\r\n\
    had access to that firearm\xE2\x80\x9D. In response to police evidence at the\r\n\
    inquiry that Jake\xE2\x80\x99s lethal injury was self-inflicted, Judy is reported\r\n\
    to have shouted \xE2\x80\x9CKeystone Kops!\xE2\x80\x9D before leaving the room. Not long\r\n\
    after, she appeared on TV implying that bungled repatriation of Jake\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    body was the consequence of a face-saving military cover-up. She said\r\n\
    there was \xE2\x80\x9Cno way known\xE2\x80\x9D that Jake would have shot himself purposely or\r\n\
    accidentally, and that she would fight to obtain the truth for her son\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cforever\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In response to this week\xE2\x80\x99s purported leak of the board\xE2\x80\x99s forthcoming\r\n\
    conclusions, Judy questioned the basis of any conclusion that Jake shot\r\n\
    himself, and the trustworthiness of any investigation resulting in that\r\n\
    conclusion. \xE2\x80\x9CThis was the army investigating the army\xE2\x80\x9D, she said, adding\r\n\
    that she has asked for a separate coronial inquiry. \xE2\x80\x9CI know what I have\r\n\
    to do for Jake. I will fight for Jake and I will fight for the truth\xE2\x80\xA6I\xE2\x80\x99m\r\n\
    his mother and I will fight for him\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    What are we to make of Judy Kovco\xE2\x80\x99s pursuit of another investigation\r\n\
    into the final moments of Private Jake Kovco?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    On the one hand, she seems to have formed a view early on in the piece -\r\n\
    while still in the early stages of shock and grief - that someone other\r\n\
    than Jake may have caused the gun to discharge. In September, months\r\n\
    after retaining separate counsel that pursued this line of inquiry, she\r\n\
    told a reporter that she was still in \xE2\x80\x9Ccomplete shock\xE2\x80\x9D from the death.\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CI still haven\xE2\x80\x99t come to grips with the fact that he\xE2\x80\x99s gone\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Has Judy Kovco imagined the bogey-men with whom she must do battle in\r\n\
    defence of her dead son, perhaps as a way of managing the terrible grief\r\n\
    a parent experiences on the death of a beloved child? Is her desire to\r\n\
    protect her son\xE2\x80\x99s reputation from post-mortem slurs on his\r\n\
    professionalism blinding her to the weight of evidence about what really\r\n\
    happened?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    On the other hand, Judy Kovco is only pointing out what is undeniably\r\n\
    true: that significant questions remain unanswered about the manner of\r\n\
    Jake\xE2\x80\x99s death, and the way the military managed and investigated it. They\r\n\
    include queries about how the DNA of one of the soldiers with Kovco at\r\n\
    the time wound up on Jake\xE2\x80\x99s gun; why the military failed to seal the\r\n\
    room after the incident, allowing Kovco\xE2\x80\x99s clothes to be destroyed, and\r\n\
    the clothes and bodies of the soldiers present to be washed (destroying\r\n\
    potential forensic evidence); and the reason for the delayed military\r\n\
    police interviews of Kovco\xE2\x80\x99s two roommates and others in the unit,\r\n\
    allowing the soldiers to get together and talk about the event. As the\r\n\
    profile of the case grew, questions must also be asked about the wisdom\r\n\
    of the military\xE2\x80\x99s insistence on investigating itself, a decision that\r\n\
    former justice George Hampel says inspires a \xE2\x80\x9Cperception that they will\r\n\
    look after their own\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Conspiracy or cock-up? Grief-blinded mother or whistle-blower? Without\r\n\
    an independent investigation of the entire affair, we may never know."

    number two man had cheated its own candidate of victory, the Victorian\n\

    would unleash the same sort of horse-trading that Federal Family First\n\
    Senator Steven Fielding has made an art form. But Austin is mistaken. It\n\
    is true that the DLP would have been only one of 3 minor parties with\n\
    whom Labor could have done deals to pass contested legislation in the\n\
    upper house. However, the known reluctance of socially conservative\n\
    Premier Steve Bracks to allow a vote to happen on the decriminalisation\n\
    of abortion, and the implied willingness of the DLP to unquestioningly\n\
    stand as one with the government if it shelved plans to bring the issue\n\
    to a vote, made the party a real threat to progress on this and other\n\
    women\xE2\x80\x99s reproductive health issues. Indeed, it is possible that the\n\
    elected DLP Member Peter Kavanagh retains the power to blackmail the\n\
    government into steering clear of the abortion debate, given the\n\
    necessity of his vote for the opposition parties to call the government\n\
    to account through the inquiry and committee process.</p>\n\n\
    <p>There are two conclusions to be drawn from the DLP seat that might have\n\
    been. The first is that sadly, state party functionaries appear\n\
    incapable of learning from the glacial mistakes of their Federal\n\
    counterparts. Despite the election of Family First\xE2\x80\x99s Steven Fielding to\n\
    the Australian Senate in 2004 on preference deals (the party had just\n\
    under 2% of the primary vote), Victorian party apparatchiks adopted\n\
    similarly misguided tactics in their preferencing of the DLP. Hopefully,\n\
    it won\xE2\x80\x99t require an entire electoral cycle of monorail-minded horse\n\
    trading of votes on key national issues in exchange for misogynist\n\
    health policy and a bit of verbal gay-bashing, to prompt wiser choices\n\
    next time around.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Which brings me to the second point: the sobering fact that around 98\n\
    per cent of Victorians in Federal elections, and 95 per cent in State\n\
    ones, vote above the line. Such electors chose only the party that gets\n\
    their primary vote. That party then decide &ndash; according to prevailing\n\
    priorities, beliefs, relationships, threats and patronage promises &ndash; how\n\
    their vote will be redistributed in the event its candidate fails to get\n\
    over the line.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The cynicism Australians feel about their political leaders makes this\n\
    an odd choice. Why give those you neither trust nor respect critical\n\
    control over who wields the reigns of power? On the other hand,\n\
    reservoirs of contempt may have nowhere to flow but to seas of\n\
    indifference. This is certainly the view of the experts who, in the\n\
    absence of hard data, speculate that a strong desire for voting to be\n\
    quick and painless motivates many to vote above the line. Above-the-line\n\
    voting is quick, and reduces the stress surrounding additional\n\
    decision-making beyond who we like best.</p>\n\n\
    <p>However, laziness and indifference may not entirely explain our voting\n\
    behaviour. Despite the newness of procedures surrounding the election of\n\
    the upper house last month, approximately 3 per cent more Victorians\n\
    voted below the line than had done in the 2004 Federal election. This\n\
    may be because the new ballot paper makes below-the-line voting easier,\n\
    requiring voters to rank just five candidates rather than the\n\
    approximately 65 needing to be ordered when voting Federally.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I also can\xE2\x80\x99t help wondering whether voters equipped with better\n\

    Electoral Act requires group voting tickets to be \xE2\x80\x9Cprominently\n\
    displayed\xE2\x80\x9D at polling booths, the VEC does little more than post\n\
    preference deals on its website and signpost the manager\xE2\x80\x99s possession of\n\
    this information at voting centres. In the future, it might be hoped\n\
    that the Bracks government\xE2\x80\x99s laudatory march towards a state-of-the-art\n\
    electoral system would see electronic voting offered to all Victorians,\n\
    not just the vision-impaired. I fantasise about a computer interface\n\
    that would respond to an above-the-line vote above the line with an\n\
    information screen explaining the nature of this choice, the preference\n\
    arrangements of the party selected, and a \xE2\x80\x9Ccomplete your vote\xE2\x80\x9D and\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cchange your vote\xE2\x80\x9D option.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It is unfair to attribute the Family First fiasco and DLP debacle to the\n\
    single transferable vote and the proportionality it introduces into the\n\
    Australian political system. Proportional representation is widely\n\

    limiting power into a democracy that concentrates significant power in\n\
    the hands of the majority. Instead, it may be the refusal of the\n\
    overwhelming majority of Australian electors to take control of the\n\

  title: Are Fathers Parents or Progenitors?
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:54:35
  content_markup: "<p>TEASE: Once upon a time, there were two men.</p>\n\n\
    <p>TEASE: The first, Gary, had a child in a shaky marriage. The couple\n\
    separated, but then reconciled. When Patti discovered she was pregnant,\n\
    both knew the child could be that of the lover she took during their\n\
    time apart. Patti agreed to put Gary\xE2\x80\x99s name on the birth certificate,\n\
    and Gary pledged to love and raise the child &ndash; Gary Jr &ndash; as his own. But\n\
    when the marriage ended, Patti asked the court to deny Gary further\n\
    access to the boy on the grounds that he was not the child\xE2\x80\x99s biological\n\
    father. Gary fought back, seeking to maintain contact and both rights\n\
    and obligations to the child. Ultimately, however, the court held that\n\
    as \xE2\x80\x9Cthird parties\xE2\x80\x9D neither he &ndash; nor his parents &ndash; had any entitlement to\n\
    a relationship with the small child.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The second man, Liam, was married for four years. After separating from\n\
    his wife he sporadically paid child support for his three children.\n\
    Several years later Liam took a paternity test that showed his eldest\n\
    child was the only one biologically related to him, enabling much of his\n\
    debt for unpaid child support for all three children &ndash; none of whom\n\
    speak to him any longer &ndash; to be cancelled. Still not content, Liam\n\
    launches a suit against his ex-wife for damages caused by her \xE2\x80\x9Cdeceit\xE2\x80\x9D,\n\
    including financial losses related \xE2\x80\x9Cto the time he had spent with, and\n\
    money he had spent on, the children under the mistaken belief that he\n\
    was their father.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>My response to these stories includes feelings of pity and of admiration\n\
    for Gary, and of moral revulsion for Liam (not to mention Patti). Yet\n\
    while Gary languishes in obscurity, Liam has become the poster-child for\n\
    parts of the Father\xE2\x80\x99s Rights Movement: the man who story is intended to\n\
    alchemise our pity and moral outrage into table-thumping demands for\n\
    systemic change to the family law system.</p>\n\n\
    <p>However, if the media\xE2\x80\x99s coverage of the two cases is anything to go by,\n\
    I may be alone in moral assessment of both men\xE2\x80\x99s actions. While Gary\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    case has been virtually ignored by the, every step of Liam\xE2\x80\x99s journey\n\
    through the courts has been catalogued by a panoply of mostly male\n\
    journalists whose indignant hearts appear to beat as one with his.\n\
    Regularly referred to as a \xE2\x80\x9Ccuckold\xE2\x80\x9D, and the children he has parented\n\
    from birth as those \xE2\x80\x9Cfathered\xE2\x80\x9D by \xE2\x80\x9Chis wife\xE2\x80\x99s lover\xE2\x80\x9D, such hacks appear\n\
    unable to resist photographing Liam in tragic poses: head bowed and hand\n\
    slapped across face, or looking wistfully into the distance at what\n\
    might have been.</p>\n\n\
    <p>What might have been? An alternative &ndash; and morally balanced universe &ndash;\n\
    would have told a different story about Gary and Liam. Gary\xE2\x80\x99s story\n\
    might have provided growing evidence of men\xE2\x80\x99s recognition of the\n\
    critical role they do and should play in the lives of children; not as\n\
    sperm donors or walking wallets, but committed hands-on parents. The\n\
    rallying of Father\xE2\x80\x99s Rights Groups behind Gary would have reinforced the\n\
    message from such groups that fathers matter in the lives of children,\n\
    and that the role of law and policy is to assist married men to actively\n\
    parent their children and to maintain their relationship with them in\n\
    the unhappy event of relationship breakdown.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In contrast, the media and Father\xE2\x80\x99s Rights Activists in this alternative\n\
    universe would largely ignore Liam\xE2\x80\x99s case. Such groups, strengthened by\n\
    the inclusion in their ranks of adoptive fathers and men parenting\n\
    children born from donor insemination, would be appalled by the cost of\n\
    Liam\xE2\x80\x99s legal manoeuvrings to the children who call him \xE2\x80\x9Cdad\xE2\x80\x9D. Joining\n\
    with the Child Support Agency to urge that parents in such situations to\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cthink about the impacts on their children\xE2\x80\x9D, both groups would judge\n\
    Liam harshly for elevating his desire for retributive justice against\n\
    his ex-wife above the viability of his paternal relationship with his\n\
    children. To avoid such cases in the future, they would call for\n\
    Australian law to consistently define fatherhood in social, rather than\n\
    biological, terms.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The closest thing to love is hate, and marriage can be a dirty game.\n\
    Infidelity in relationships where faithfulness is expected or agreed to\n\
    is wrong, no matter who does the deed (though statistics remind us that\n\
    men &ndash; not women &ndash; are most often the culprits)) But how much tarring and\n\
    feathering should innocent dependants be asked to wear to assuage the\n\
    pride or deepen the hip pocket of either party?</p>\n\n\
    <p>In my alternative moral universe every person dignified with the title\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cadult\xE2\x80\x9D would know when enough is enough.</p>\n"

  content: "TEASE: Once upon a time, there were two men.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    TEASE: The first, Gary, had a child in a shaky marriage. The couple\r\n\
    separated, but then reconciled. When Patti discovered she was pregnant,\r\n\
    both knew the child could be that of the lover she took during their\r\n\
    time apart. Patti agreed to put Gary\xE2\x80\x99s name on the birth certificate,\r\n\
    and Gary pledged to love and raise the child - Gary Jr - as his own. But\r\n\
    when the marriage ended, Patti asked the court to deny Gary further\r\n\
    access to the boy on the grounds that he was not the child\xE2\x80\x99s biological\r\n\
    father. Gary fought back, seeking to maintain contact and both rights\r\n\
    and obligations to the child. Ultimately, however, the court held that\r\n\
    as \xE2\x80\x9Cthird parties\xE2\x80\x9D neither he - nor his parents - had any entitlement to\r\n\
    a relationship with the small child.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The second man, Liam, was married for four years. After separating from\r\n\
    his wife he sporadically paid child support for his three children.\r\n\
    Several years later Liam took a paternity test that showed his eldest\r\n\
    child was the only one biologically related to him, enabling much of his\r\n\
    debt for unpaid child support for all three children - none of whom\r\n\
    speak to him any longer - to be cancelled. Still not content, Liam\r\n\
    launches a suit against his ex-wife for damages caused by her \xE2\x80\x9Cdeceit\xE2\x80\x9D,\r\n\
    including financial losses related \xE2\x80\x9Cto the time he had spent with, and\r\n\
    money he had spent on, the children under the mistaken belief that he\r\n\
    was their father.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    My response to these stories includes feelings of pity and of admiration\r\n\
    for Gary, and of moral revulsion for Liam (not to mention Patti). Yet\r\n\
    while Gary languishes in obscurity, Liam has become the poster-child for\r\n\
    parts of the Father\xE2\x80\x99s Rights Movement: the man who story is intended to\r\n\
    alchemise our pity and moral outrage into table-thumping demands for\r\n\
    systemic change to the family law system.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    However, if the media\xE2\x80\x99s coverage of the two cases is anything to go by,\r\n\
    I may be alone in moral assessment of both men\xE2\x80\x99s actions. While Gary\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    case has been virtually ignored by the, every step of Liam\xE2\x80\x99s journey\r\n\
    through the courts has been catalogued by a panoply of mostly male\r\n\
    journalists whose indignant hearts appear to beat as one with his.\r\n\
    Regularly referred to as a \xE2\x80\x9Ccuckold\xE2\x80\x9D, and the children he has parented\r\n\
    from birth as those \xE2\x80\x9Cfathered\xE2\x80\x9D by \xE2\x80\x9Chis wife\xE2\x80\x99s lover\xE2\x80\x9D, such hacks appear\r\n\
    unable to resist photographing Liam in tragic poses: head bowed and hand\r\n\
    slapped across face, or looking wistfully into the distance at what\r\n\
    might have been.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    What might have been? An alternative - and morally balanced universe -\r\n\
    would have told a different story about Gary and Liam. Gary\xE2\x80\x99s story\r\n\
    might have provided growing evidence of men\xE2\x80\x99s recognition of the\r\n\
    critical role they do and should play in the lives of children; not as\r\n\
    sperm donors or walking wallets, but committed hands-on parents. The\r\n\
    rallying of Father\xE2\x80\x99s Rights Groups behind Gary would have reinforced the\r\n\
    message from such groups that fathers matter in the lives of children,\r\n\
    and that the role of law and policy is to assist married men to actively\r\n\
    parent their children and to maintain their relationship with them in\r\n\
    the unhappy event of relationship breakdown.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In contrast, the media and Father\xE2\x80\x99s Rights Activists in this alternative\r\n\
    universe would largely ignore Liam\xE2\x80\x99s case. Such groups, strengthened by\r\n\
    the inclusion in their ranks of adoptive fathers and men parenting\r\n\
    children born from donor insemination, would be appalled by the cost of\r\n\
    Liam\xE2\x80\x99s legal manoeuvrings to the children who call him \xE2\x80\x9Cdad\xE2\x80\x9D. Joining\r\n\
    with the Child Support Agency to urge that parents in such situations to\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cthink about the impacts on their children\xE2\x80\x9D, both groups would judge\r\n\
    Liam harshly for elevating his desire for retributive justice against\r\n\
    his ex-wife above the viability of his paternal relationship with his\r\n\
    children. To avoid such cases in the future, they would call for\r\n\
    Australian law to consistently define fatherhood in social, rather than\r\n\
    biological, terms.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The closest thing to love is hate, and marriage can be a dirty game.\r\n\
    Infidelity in relationships where faithfulness is expected or agreed to\r\n\
    is wrong, no matter who does the deed (though statistics remind us that\r\n\
    men - not women - are most often the culprits)) But how much tarring and\r\n\
    feathering should innocent dependants be asked to wear to assuage the\r\n\
    pride or deepen the hip pocket of either party?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In my alternative moral universe every person dignified with the title\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cadult\xE2\x80\x9D would know when enough is enough."

    <p>Children\xE2\x80\x99s bodies change rapidly right up to their early twenties, with\n\
    the pre-teen and teen years critical moments for the development of\n\
    self-identity and self-esteem. It\xE2\x80\x99s hard to imagine a worse time for\n\

    true for children as for adults. The higher the temperature surrounding\n\
    the moral panic about our children\xE2\x80\x99s expanding girth, the worse\n\
    overweight children are likely to feel about themselves, and the less\n\
    likely they are to feel worthy of their own efforts to change.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This counterproductive behavioural circularity that begins with low\n\
    self-esteem is familiar to addiction counsellors, and is no less evident\n\
    &ndash; should we care to listen &ndash; in the testimony of the overweight. \xE2\x80\x9CYou\n\
    get in a vicious circle about losing weight,\xE2\x80\x9D Diane O\xE2\x80\x99Mara told the Age\n\
    earlier this year. \xE2\x80\x9CYou eat the wrong thing, then you feel bad, then you\n\
    eat more.\xE2\x80\x9D The nexus between harsh social judgments of the obese, their\n\
    low self-esteem and consequent inability to lose weight is summed up by\n\
    American professor and author Peter Stearns. \xE2\x80\x9CIf you fail to lose weight\n\
    you are demonstrating you\xE2\x80\x99re a bad person. It\xE2\x80\x99s a big burden. Faced with\n\
    this additional pressure you are even more likely to say `The hell with\n\
    it! I\xE2\x80\x99m going to get ice cream. I am such a bad person I need to solace\n\
    myself.\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Of course, the poor correlation between negative self esteem and\n\
    successful weight loss serves the diet industry well. Studies suggest\n\
    that only when consumers hate their overweight bodies, and believe them\n\
    unattractive, are they motivated to dig deep for the diet products and\n\
    services worth more than 500 million a year in Australia. As well, the\n\
    now accepted paradox that dieting makes you fat ensures that the vast\n\
    majority of consumers will \xE2\x80\x9Cfail\xE2\x80\x9D and &ndash; dragging their bedraggled\n\
    self-esteem behind them &ndash; return for second and third helpings of\n\
    expensive but ineffective \xE2\x80\x9Ctherapy\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But if insults are counter-productive and hand wringing is out, what\n\
    should we be doing? In general terms, we need to stop talking about the\n\
    depravity of fat, and focus instead on the desirability of good health.\n\
    Focusing on obesity inevitably leads to \xE2\x80\x9Cdon\xE2\x80\x99t\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cshouldn\xE2\x80\x99t\xE2\x80\x9D messages\n\
    that problematically posit guilt and counterproductively idealise\n\
    penitent self-denial. In contrast, promoting good health lends itself to\n\
    messages of \xE2\x80\x9Cdo\xE2\x80\x9D (eat healthy foods) and \xE2\x80\x9Cdesert\xE2\x80\x9D (as in, you deserve\n\
    it) that connect self-nurture with the bodily well-being necessary to\n\
    enjoy the good things in life.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Positive messages are also more likely to be effective in promoting\n\
    behavioural change, and insofar as they focus more on the importance of\n\
    staying active rather than on what we eat, may even be more consistent\n\
    with the medical evidence. Paul Campos, Professor of law at the\n\
    University of Colorado and author of The Obesity Myth argues that\n\
    activity is a better predictor of health than weight and that \xE2\x80\x9CThere is\n\
    no good evidence that significant long-term weight loss is beneficial to\n\
    health\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>We need to speak to our children, and about them, in ways that make our\n\
    love for them, and approval of the people they are becoming, crystal\n\
    clear. Teaching them how to nurture themselves by eating healthy food\n\
    and participating in physical activity they enjoy is the most ethical\n\
    and effective way for us as parents, and as a society, to offer them the\n\
    gift of good health.</p>\n"

  title: Privacy Should be Our Choice
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:53:55
  content_markup: "<p>Privacy, as Victorian Privacy Commissioner Paul Chadwick recently\n\
    observed, is a freedom most noticed in its absence. Sadly, we only seem\n\
    to appreciate what we had once it\xE2\x80\x99s gone.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Philosophers, having long accepted the inadequacy of words to explain\n\
    the importance of privacy, often illustrate it with 18th century thinker\n\
    Jeremy Bentham\xE2\x80\x99s panopticon.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The panopticon is a circular building divided into cells constructed\n\
    around a central tower. While occupants are isolated from one another by\n\
    walls, they can be viewed by an unseen observer.</p>\n\n\
    <p>A prison? Absolutely, but more than this the building was designed to\n\
    obtain \xE2\x80\x9Cpower of mind over mind by creating a\xE2\x80\x9Dsentiment of an invisible\n\
    omniscience\", or what you and I might describe as the unnerving\n\
    uncertainty that someone could be watching you.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The value of privacy is only grasped when we recognize that even if the\n\
    surveyors do nothing with the information they gather about cell\n\
    occupants &ndash; neither recording nor relaying it &ndash; it is their power to\n\
    observe us if and when they choose that causes harm.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Federal Government announced last April its intention to pursue what\n\
    is in all but name a national identity card. The scheme has the capacity\n\
    to compromise our privacy in relationship to government, and the\n\
    mega-corporations (among them Unisys, Visa and IBM) expected to vie for\n\
    the lucrative privilege of providing the technology to merge, match and\n\
    share our personal information across the public and private sectors.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Current proposals suggest my card will contain my unique identifying\n\
    number and name on the front, as well as my signature and biometric\n\
    photo. The smart chip will contain &ndash; among other things &ndash; my address, my\n\
    date of birth and details of my children and other dependants. These\n\
    details are mandatory, must reside in the \xE2\x80\x9Cpublic\xE2\x80\x9D zone of the card, and\n\
    are protected by a PIN so insecure that the Australian Privacy\n\
    Foundation has condemned the card\xE2\x80\x99s technological design as \xE2\x80\x9Ccompletely\n\
    inadequate\xE2\x80\x9D. In other words, according to the parts of the legislation\n\
    the government has made public, anyone with a card reader will be able\n\
    to see the private details stored on my card\xE2\x80\x99s chip.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This includes hundreds of thousands of government employees, health and\n\
    allied professions and childcare workers. Last year Centrelink revealed\n\
    it had to sack, sanction or turn over to the police or government\n\
    prosecutors 2% of their staff for breaches of \xE2\x80\x9Ccustomer\xE2\x80\x9D privacy.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Some people object to identity cards on principle. They, like Liberal\n\
    party official Tim Warner, believe that by forcing us to prove our\n\
    identity to obtain government services, ID cards invert the master\n\
    servant relationship of citizen and government. Governments only confirm\n\
    such fears when they contend that those with nothing to hide have\n\
    nothing to fear.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I agree with such principles, but my objection to the card is more\n\
    practical.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I advocate for reproductive rights. Each year I spend time and money\n\
    protecting my phone number (it\xE2\x80\x99s silent), my address (not on the\n\
    electoral rolls), and the names, ages and other identifying details of\n\
    my children. I do this because a handful of my opponents are violent, as\n\
    the murder of a security guard at the East Melbourne Fertility Clinic in\n\
    2001 proved. As far as possible, I try to protect my family from the\n\
    negative repercussions of my activism.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Minister for Human Services Joe Hockey says that when it comes to the\n\
    card, Australians have choice. We don\xE2\x80\x99t have to have the card at all. As\n\
    well, he says that the card mandates the same information found on a\n\
    driver\xE2\x80\x99s license. If the system is cracked &ndash; something he has repeatedly\n\
    refused to guarantee won\xE2\x80\x99t happen &ndash; citizens lose no more than they do\n\
    when their wallets go missing.</p>\n\n\
    <p>First, it is disingenuous to say that participation in the new identity\n\
    card system is voluntary. No card means no Medicare rebates, PBS\n\
    medicines, Centrelink payments, Veteran\xE2\x80\x99s pensions, disability benefits,\n\
    carers\xE2\x80\x99 payments, baby bonus, AusStudy, unemployment benefits or related\n\
    concessions on public transport and utility bills. Unless we are\n\
    independently wealthy, we will need to sign up.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The wallet story also mischaracterizes reality. I lose mine with\n\
    absent-minded-professorial regularity and usually, someone nice returns\n\
    it to me intact.</p>\n\n\
    <p>When they don\xE2\x80\x99t, or its been deliberately nabbed, the loss of my silent\n\
    number or information about my children has never been a concern. This\n\
    is not only because, like most people, I don\xE2\x80\x99t keep this information in\n\
    my wallet, but because even if I did, it would be unlikely to be of\n\
    interest to an opportunistic thief: something that can\xE2\x80\x99t be said about\n\
    the high-tech robbers expected to attempt to break in to the honeypot of\n\
    identity card data.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Like much that is lost, neither the privacy of my silent number or\n\
    address can be found again. Like a victim of domestic violence, at\n\
    similar risk to having their safety jeopardized by exposure of their\n\
    address details, getting a new number and shifting house are the only\n\
    way to regain my security. At least it\xE2\x80\x99s something. The privacy of my\n\
    children\xE2\x80\x99s details is gone forever.</p>\n\n\
    <p>All of us are at risk of such irrecoverable loss of our private\n\
    identifying details and &ndash; because the database will hold our biometric\n\
    data and copies of our proof of identity documents like passports and\n\
    birth certificates &ndash; identity theft. No matter how state of the art the\n\
    security designed to protect it, the very nature of the IT wars &ndash; the\n\
    battle for supremacy between security geeks and crackers &ndash; means\n\
    security risks to the system will be perpetual and very real. Steal my\n\
    credit card, I cancel it and get another. But what next when a\n\
    cyber-crim knocks off the biometric parameters of my face?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Current proposals for an Australian identity card put my security and\n\
    that of my family at risk. However, one should not need to demonstrate\n\
    such a threat to claim the right to enjoy the benefits of privacy. The\n\
    balance is all wrong. The question isn\xE2\x80\x99t whether citizens have something\n\
    to hide. The question is whether the government is entitled to demand,\n\
    record, sift, sort, match and share our private information and\n\
    biometric identifiers without making a solid case for why this is\n\
    necessary, how it will work, and why less invasive approaches won\xE2\x80\x99t do.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The kick-off date for card issuing is April or May 2008. Time is fast\n\
    running out for Australians to say \xE2\x80\x9Cno\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n"

    Philosophers, having long accepted the inadequacy of words to explain\r\n\
    the importance of privacy, often illustrate it with 18th century thinker\r\n\
    Jeremy Bentham\xE2\x80\x99s panopticon.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The panopticon is a circular building divided into cells constructed\r\n\
    around a central tower. While occupants are isolated from one another by\r\n\
    walls, they can be viewed by an unseen observer.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    A prison? Absolutely, but more than this the building was designed to\r\n\
    obtain \xE2\x80\x9Cpower of mind over mind by creating a\xE2\x80\x9Dsentiment of an invisible\r\n\
    omniscience\", or what you and I might describe as the unnerving\r\n\
    uncertainty that someone could be watching you.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The value of privacy is only grasped when we recognize that even if the\r\n\
    surveyors do nothing with the information they gather about cell\r\n\
    occupants - neither recording nor relaying it - it is their power to\r\n\
    observe us if and when they choose that causes harm.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The Federal Government announced last April its intention to pursue what\r\n\
    is in all but name a national identity card. The scheme has the capacity\r\n\
    to compromise our privacy in relationship to government, and the\r\n\
    mega-corporations (among them Unisys, Visa and IBM) expected to vie for\r\n\
    the lucrative privilege of providing the technology to merge, match and\r\n\
    share our personal information across the public and private sectors.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Current proposals suggest my card will contain my unique identifying\r\n\
    number and name on the front, as well as my signature and biometric\r\n\
    photo. The smart chip will contain - among other things - my address, my\r\n\
    date of birth and details of my children and other dependants. These\r\n\
    details are mandatory, must reside in the \xE2\x80\x9Cpublic\xE2\x80\x9D zone of the card, and\r\n\
    are protected by a PIN so insecure that the Australian Privacy\r\n\
    Foundation has condemned the card\xE2\x80\x99s technological design as \xE2\x80\x9Ccompletely\r\n\
    inadequate\xE2\x80\x9D. In other words, according to the parts of the legislation\r\n\
    the government has made public, anyone with a card reader will be able\r\n\
    to see the private details stored on my card\xE2\x80\x99s chip.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This includes hundreds of thousands of government employees, health and\r\n\
    allied professions and childcare workers. Last year Centrelink revealed\r\n\
    it had to sack, sanction or turn over to the police or government\r\n\
    prosecutors 2% of their staff for breaches of \xE2\x80\x9Ccustomer\xE2\x80\x9D privacy.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Some people object to identity cards on principle. They, like Liberal\r\n\
    party official Tim Warner, believe that by forcing us to prove our\r\n\
    identity to obtain government services, ID cards invert the master\r\n\
    servant relationship of citizen and government. Governments only confirm\r\n\
    such fears when they contend that those with nothing to hide have\r\n\
    nothing to fear.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I agree with such principles, but my objection to the card is more\r\n\
    practical.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I advocate for reproductive rights. Each year I spend time and money\r\n\
    protecting my phone number (it\xE2\x80\x99s silent), my address (not on the\r\n\
    electoral rolls), and the names, ages and other identifying details of\r\n\
    my children. I do this because a handful of my opponents are violent, as\r\n\
    the murder of a security guard at the East Melbourne Fertility Clinic in\r\n\
    2001 proved. As far as possible, I try to protect my family from the\r\n\
    negative repercussions of my activism.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Minister for Human Services Joe Hockey says that when it comes to the\r\n\
    card, Australians have choice. We don\xE2\x80\x99t have to have the card at all. As\r\n\
    well, he says that the card mandates the same information found on a\r\n\
    driver\xE2\x80\x99s license. If the system is cracked - something he has repeatedly\r\n\
    refused to guarantee won\xE2\x80\x99t happen - citizens lose no more than they do\r\n\
    when their wallets go missing.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    First, it is disingenuous to say that participation in the new identity\r\n\
    card system is voluntary. No card means no Medicare rebates, PBS\r\n\
    medicines, Centrelink payments, Veteran\xE2\x80\x99s pensions, disability benefits,\r\n\
    carers\xE2\x80\x99 payments, baby bonus, AusStudy, unemployment benefits or related\r\n\
    concessions on public transport and utility bills. Unless we are\r\n\
    independently wealthy, we will need to sign up.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The wallet story also mischaracterizes reality. I lose mine with\r\n\
    absent-minded-professorial regularity and usually, someone nice returns\r\n\
    it to me intact.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    When they don\xE2\x80\x99t, or its been deliberately nabbed, the loss of my silent\r\n\
    number or information about my children has never been a concern. This\r\n\
    is not only because, like most people, I don\xE2\x80\x99t keep this information in\r\n\
    my wallet, but because even if I did, it would be unlikely to be of\r\n\
    interest to an opportunistic thief: something that can\xE2\x80\x99t be said about\r\n\
    the high-tech robbers expected to attempt to break in to the honeypot of\r\n\
    identity card data.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Like much that is lost, neither the privacy of my silent number or\r\n\
    address can be found again. Like a victim of domestic violence, at\r\n\
    similar risk to having their safety jeopardized by exposure of their\r\n\
    address details, getting a new number and shifting house are the only\r\n\
    way to regain my security. At least it\xE2\x80\x99s something. The privacy of my\r\n\
    children\xE2\x80\x99s details is gone forever.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    All of us are at risk of such irrecoverable loss of our private\r\n\
    identifying details and - because the database will hold our biometric\r\n\
    data and copies of our proof of identity documents like passports and\r\n\
    birth certificates - identity theft. No matter how state of the art the\r\n\
    security designed to protect it, the very nature of the IT wars - the\r\n\
    battle for supremacy between security geeks and crackers - means\r\n\
    security risks to the system will be perpetual and very real. Steal my\r\n\
    credit card, I cancel it and get another. But what next when a\r\n\
    cyber-crim knocks off the biometric parameters of my face?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Current proposals for an Australian identity card put my security and\r\n\
    that of my family at risk. However, one should not need to demonstrate\r\n\
    such a threat to claim the right to enjoy the benefits of privacy. The\r\n\
    balance is all wrong. The question isn\xE2\x80\x99t whether citizens have something\r\n\
    to hide. The question is whether the government is entitled to demand,\r\n\
    record, sift, sort, match and share our private information and\r\n\
    biometric identifiers without making a solid case for why this is\r\n\
    necessary, how it will work, and why less invasive approaches won\xE2\x80\x99t do.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The kick-off date for card issuing is April or May 2008. Time is fast\r\n\
    running out for Australians to say \xE2\x80\x9Cno\xE2\x80\x9D."

    <p>International and Australian surveys repeatedly show strong public\n\
    support for euthanasia. A 2002 Morgan survey found 70% in favour of laws\n\
    allowing hopelessly ill patients to seek assistance from doctors to\n\
    suicide. Seventy-five per cent of sitting members in the last Victorian\n\
    parliament supported the rights of the terminally ill to die with\n\

    <p>Such figures may explain why opponents of a right-to-die rarely mention\n\
    the religious and ideological principles behind their stand and focus\n\
    instead on pragmatic objections to legal change. These include claims\n\
    that patient-controlled death will undercut efforts to improve\n\
    palliative care, that proper pain management always alleviates\n\
    suffering, and that only what Juliette Hughes (Opinion 30/1) calls \xE2\x80\x9Cthe\n\
    desperate, lonely, depressed and in pain\xE2\x80\x9D (ie those lacking autonomy)\n\
    choose death over palliation.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Oregon, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland allow medicos to\n\
    respond to patient requests for active assistance to die. Empirical\n\
    evidence from these jurisdictions does not support claims that the\n\
    legalisation of assisted suicide for the terminally ill undercuts the\n\
    quality of palliative care. This makes sense, as only around 2% of\n\
    terminally ill patients make use of their legal right to assisted\n\
    suicide. The remainder continue to choose palliative care.</p>\n\n\
    <p>A phenomenal 77% of Australians disbelieve the repeated insistence of\n\
    right to die opponents that modern palliative care sufficiently\n\
    addresses the suffering of the terminally ill. The decision of John\n\
    Elliot &ndash; a medical doctor &ndash; to suicide in Zurich last Thursday suggests\n\
    he didn\xE2\x80\x99t believe it either. Or, alternatively, that he understood that\n\
    suffering is not limited to physical pain but includes the loss of one\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    wits, privacy with regard to bodily functions and the capacity to\n\
    present oneself to others &ndash; including one\xE2\x80\x99s spouse and children &ndash; as one\n\
    would like to be seen. Anticipation of uncontrolled pain as well as the\n\
    loss of such personal dignity appears a major motivator of Elliot\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    decision to die: \xE2\x80\x9CMy disease has dictated that\xE2\x80\xA6I will die in pain. Worse\n\
    than this, though, I will have no dignity in death. I don\xE2\x80\x99t want my wife\n\
    Angelika to see me in this way\xE2\x80\xA6. I want to exit this world\xE2\x80\xA6with my head\n\
    held high.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>At the heart of the right-to-die case are claims about the entitlement\n\
    of citizens to autonomously choose to live what they define as a good\n\
    life, and die what they see as a good death. But Liberal democratic\n\
    societies have no obligation to honour the wishes of the incompetent or\n\
    the coerced. This is why those opposed to the legal right to die use\n\
    language &ndash; \xE2\x80\x9Cknocked off\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cput to death\xE2\x80\x9D &ndash; that assumes what must be\n\
    proved: that those other than the terminally ill will dictate the ifs\n\
    and whens of an assisted suicide.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Circular definitions help \xE2\x80\x9Cprove\xE2\x80\x9D their case. For right-to-die\n\
    opponents, only the depressed choose death over palliation, and\n\
    depressed patients can\xE2\x80\x99t make autonomous choices. Similarly, it is\n\
    claimed that patients who are loved and adequately cared for will not\n\
    choose to die, rendering all who do make this choice necessary victims\n\
    of coercion by penny-pinching medical administrators or avaricious\n\
    relatives.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Dr Elliot was wealthy, educated, not depressed, and consistent about his\n\
    desire to die. But his life was not perfect. His wife was open about the\n\
    burdensome nature of his care. In his recitation of his reasons for\n\
    choosing death Elliot includes the fact that he had burdened her for\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Ctoo long already\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Do decisions to die that reference the needs or influence of important\n\
    others, or society at large, lack the independence necessary for us to\n\
    heed them? Those opposed to individual choice in personal moral matters\n\

    \xE2\x80\x9Ccoerce\xE2\x80\x9D women into abortion in the same way as inadequately sacrificing\n\

    <p>The truth is that if choices were only available to those with perfect\n\

    between them. It\xE2\x80\x99s another to say that less than ideal choice is no\n\
    choice at all. As well, arguments that the addition of\n\

    this even if the entire mess had been caused by their mistakenly coming\n\
    to your door rather than the burning house down the street, or the lack\n\

    in Victoria are high and rising.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I think we need to dig deeper. Down, in fact, to the central moral\n\
    claims of the safe sex message at the heart of public health campaigns\n\
    to reduce transmission of HIV/AIDS.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Debates about the moral adequacy of the safe sex message have been going\n\
    on in the HIV Positive community for years. On one side are those who\n\
    support public health messages focused solely on the responsibility\n\

    that cajole men to not be a fool and \xE2\x80\x9Ccover their tool\xE2\x80\x9D, to the \xE2\x80\x9Ccover\n\
    yourself against AIDS\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Clove is not enough\xE2\x80\x9D messages, the existing\n\
    educational focus emphasizes the need for people who wish to avoid\n\
    infection to watch their own backs. Commented the CEO of the Victorian\n\
    AIDS Council on the Neal case: \xE2\x80\x9CWithout wishing to sound like the last\n\
    of the rugged individualists, people do need to take the responsibility\n\
    to protect themselves\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Of course the flip side of the \xE2\x80\x9Cit\xE2\x80\x99s all down to you\xE2\x80\x9D approach is that\n\
    when unsafe consensual sex does result in transmission, it is the newly\n\
    infected partner who wears the blame. This is particularly the case. it\n\
    appears, if the reason the HIV-negative person had unprotected sex\n\
    because they trusted that a positive partner would either disclose his\n\
    status or simply refuse to proceed without a condom. \xE2\x80\x9CWe\xE2\x80\x99re trying to\n\
    work on educating people not to make those mistakes and assumptions that\n\
    stuff up their lives\xE2\x80\x9D, the convener of the National Association of\n\
    People Living with HIV/AIDS said recently.</p>\n\n\
    <p>On the other side of the debate are those like the former convener of\n\
    Positive Women Philomena Horsley who reject the blame-the-victim feel of\n\
    this hyper-individualist approach to public health. They contend that\n\
    while there may be good reason to design public health messages to\n\
    trigger the natural inclination of most to look out for number one, the\n\
    moral inadequacy of this approach &ndash; and it\xE2\x80\x99s lack of cohesion with the\n\
    moral expectations of many &ndash; demands an urgent revamp. They note that\n\
    not only do some gay men assume their sexual partner will do the right\n\
    thing by them, this propensity to trust others not to do the dirty on\n\
    them is not just a normal and good thing, it is largely justified.\n\
    According to a recent report by the Australian Research Centre for Sex,\n\
    Health and Society, the vast majority of HIV positive men in Australia\n\
    do disclose their status to sexual partners at the beginning of a\n\
    relationship or the moment they discover it themselves, while the\n\
    majority wear condoms in casual encounters with partners whose HIV\n\
    status they either do not know or know to be negative.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In other words, despite consistent communications to the sexually active\n\
    of all varieties that the only obligations we have are to ourselves,\n\
    those infected by the virus &ndash; and at risk of infection &ndash; expect more\n\
    than this, both from ourselves and from others. We expect that as human\n\
    beings we have obligations not to harm our fellows, and that having HIV\n\
    or being at risk of it doesn\xE2\x80\x99t ameliorate this responsibility one jot.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Nor should it. It is not \xE2\x80\x9Cruggedly individualistic\xE2\x80\x9D but rather morally\n\
    offensive for public health messages to imply that we have no\n\
    responsibilities to other human beings, and that we are chumps when we\n\
    expect others to recognize and honor their obligations to us. Not just\n\
    offensive, but out of touch with the everyday sexual morality practiced\n\
    by many, and dismissive of the needs and circumstances of particular\n\
    at-risk communities.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Most notable of these is the small but sadly growing community of\n\
    positive women. Women commonly contract HIV from their spouses or steady\n\
    boyfriends, men who these women trust are not just faithful but\n\
    straight. Public health messages that imply that these women had no one\n\
    to blame but themselves for infection because they didn\xE2\x80\x99t insist that\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cif it wasn\xE2\x80\x99t on, it wasn\xE2\x80\x99t on\xE2\x80\x9D overlook the culpability these men bear\n\
    for failing to disclose their risk factors or to insist that a condom be\n\
    worn every time.</p>\n\n\
    <p>What is the answer? I\xE2\x80\x99d like to see a \xE2\x80\x9CSafe Sex Plus\xE2\x80\x9D approach to\n\
    reducing infection rates. Men and women should continue to be told that\n\
    the best way of protecting themselves from infection is to ensure\n\
    condoms are part of each sexual encounter, but they must also be\n\
    reminded of their obligation to do the right thing by others.</p>\n\n\
    <p>If individuals know they are or might be positive, they have an\n\
    obligation to protect their sexual partner by either disclosing what\n\
    they know &ndash; or don\xE2\x80\x99t know &ndash; about their HIV status, or simply insisting\n\
    on a condom every time. And if infection does occur, it is not those who\n\
    trusted in others not to harm them who deserve blame, but those who\n\
    didn\xE2\x80\x99t do all that they could to avoid doing the harming.</p>\n"

    them is not just a normal and good thing, it is largely justified.\r\n\
    According to a recent report by the Australian Research Centre for Sex,\r\n\
    Health and Society, the vast majority of HIV positive men in Australia\r\n\
    do disclose their status to sexual partners at the beginning of a\r\n\
    relationship or the moment they discover it themselves, while the\r\n\
    majority wear condoms in casual encounters with partners whose HIV\r\n\
    status they either do not know or know to be negative.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In other words, despite consistent communications to the sexually active\r\n\
    of all varieties that the only obligations we have are to ourselves,\r\n\
    those infected by the virus - and at risk of infection - expect more\r\n\
    than this, both from ourselves and from others. We expect that as human\r\n\
    beings we have obligations not to harm our fellows, and that having HIV\r\n\
    or being at risk of it doesn\xE2\x80\x99t ameliorate this responsibility one jot.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Nor should it. It is not \xE2\x80\x9Cruggedly individualistic\xE2\x80\x9D but rather morally\r\n\
    offensive for public health messages to imply that we have no\r\n\
    responsibilities to other human beings, and that we are chumps when we\r\n\
    expect others to recognize and honor their obligations to us. Not just\r\n\
    offensive, but out of touch with the everyday sexual morality practiced\r\n\
    by many, and dismissive of the needs and circumstances of particular\r\n\
    at-risk communities.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Most notable of these is the small but sadly growing community of\r\n\
    positive women. Women commonly contract HIV from their spouses or steady\r\n\
    boyfriends, men who these women trust are not just faithful but\r\n\
    straight. Public health messages that imply that these women had no one\r\n\
    to blame but themselves for infection because they didn\xE2\x80\x99t insist that\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cif it wasn\xE2\x80\x99t on, it wasn\xE2\x80\x99t on\xE2\x80\x9D overlook the culpability these men bear\r\n\
    for failing to disclose their risk factors or to insist that a condom be\r\n\
    worn every time.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    What is the answer? I\xE2\x80\x99d like to see a \xE2\x80\x9CSafe Sex Plus\xE2\x80\x9D approach to\r\n\
    reducing infection rates. Men and women should continue to be told that\r\n\
    the best way of protecting themselves from infection is to ensure\r\n\
    condoms are part of each sexual encounter, but they must also be\r\n\
    reminded of their obligation to do the right thing by others.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    If individuals know they are or might be positive, they have an\r\n\
    obligation to protect their sexual partner by either disclosing what\r\n\
    they know - or don\xE2\x80\x99t know - about their HIV status, or simply insisting\r\n\
    on a condom every time. And if infection does occur, it is not those who\r\n\
    trusted in others not to harm them who deserve blame, but those who\r\n\
    didn\xE2\x80\x99t do all that they could to avoid doing the harming."

    <p>Australian women are hit hardest by this gap in legal protection, in\n\
    particular, women facing an unplanned pregnancy. This is because they\n\
    are the targets of ads for \xE2\x80\x9Ccounseling\xE2\x80\x9D by agencies that don\xE2\x80\x99t provide\n\

    for an abortion, or even to a service that they believe will.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Let\xE2\x80\x99s be clear. The problem here is not that agencies exist that won\xE2\x80\x99t\n\
    refer for termination. The problem is that such agencies don\xE2\x80\x99t clearly\n\
    state that this is their policy in their ads.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The push to put an end to such deception began last year with a private\n\
    member\xE2\x80\x99s bill introduced by Natasha Stott Despoja. The compelling and\n\
    commonsense nature of the case against false advertising saw her joined\n\
    earlier this year by Senators from most of the major parties to\n\
    co-sponsor a simplified version of the Bill: Liberal Judith Troeth,\n\

    <p>Labor had promised to support the Pregnancy Counselling (Truth in\n\
    Advertising) Bill, which was introduced into Federal Parliament early\n\
    this year. Because the Greens and Democrats were already on board, its\n\

    cross the floor &ndash; and the numbers were there &ndash; to make it law.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But last month the Labor leadership balked. When opponents of\n\

    vote was \xE2\x80\x9Cdeferred\xE2\x80\x9D. Oh, to be a fly on the wall at that caucus meeting.\n\
    I mean, what exactly do those opposed to truth in advertising, in all\n\
    instances or just when it applies to pregnant women, say in support of\n\
    their case? Deceptive means are OK when we think the ends &ndash; a claimed\n\
    reduction in the abortion rate &ndash; are so good? Or do they instead, as\n\

    do?</p>\n\n\

    statement like \xE2\x80\x9Cthis service does/does not provide referrals for\n\
    termination of pregnancy\xE2\x80\x9D. It does not require that any agency refer for\n\

    <p>Yet the situation remains urgent. Today, the Federal government launched\n\

    \xE2\x80\x9CHelpline\xE2\x80\x9D continues to inspire concern amongst Federal women Senators.\n\
    Senator Stott Despoja, for instance, has recently worried that the\n\
    telephone line would not provide relevant or specific information or\n\
    helpful referrals. Because it will be a free service, anxiety about the\n\
    truthfulness of the ads run to notify the public of its existence are\n\

    <p>A new campaign, jointly sponsored by GetUp and Reproductive Choice\n\

    a petition supporting honest advertising of pregnancy counselling\n\
    services. The current campaign aims to inform Australians that if they\n\
    want another RU486-type victory &ndash; an empowering piece of legislation by\n\

  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:52:40
  content_markup: "<p>The government is in trouble in the polls and the Prime Minister claims\n\
    there\xE2\x80\x99s no rabbits in the hat. Maybe, but I\xE2\x80\x99m skeptical. Both history\n\
    and early policy signs &ndash; the reduction of benefits available to new\n\
    migrants, the Federal government\xE2\x80\x99s consideration of a ban on HIV\n\
    positive migrants &ndash; suggests that as polling day draws closer, there\n\
    will be rabbits. The same ones that have been stewed before.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The multicultural \xE2\x80\x9Cwedge\xE2\x80\x9D is all about the so-called Howard Battlers,\n\
    the economically liberal, socially conservative swing voters shamelessly\n\
    courted by both major parties. Its existence reminds us how easy it is\n\
    to divide Australians over multiculturalism, though the real question is\n\
    why.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It would be silly to deny that fear of difference amongst segments of\n\
    the population, and its kissing cousin racism, play a role. But a\n\
    perception of unaddressed weaknesses in the multicultural credo may also\n\
    be to blame.</p>\n\n\
    <p>At the heart of multiculturalism is an assertion about the positive\n\
    nature of difference and the benefits that homogenous societies gain by\n\
    accepting different religions, ethnic, racial, cultural, and linguistic\n\
    groups, and assisting them to maintain and share their knowledge,\n\
    perspectives and cultures. Behind such claims is the unarticulated\n\
    presumption that the only apects of culture that migrants seek to\n\
    preserve, and to share with the wider community, are those Ayaan Hirsi\n\
    Ali recently described as <a href=\"\">sentimental</a> language, music, culinary\n\
    traditions and cultural and religious rituals.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Australians opposed to the intake of non-Anglo migrants and the respect\n\
    afforded to such sentimental differences by cultural institutions like\n\
    schools and governments &ndash; the yearly outcry against cr&egrave;ches that\n\
    celebrate multiple religious festivals in December rather than just\n\
    Christmas is the classic &ndash; appear to be motivated by nothing more lofty\n\
    than racism, prejudice based on stereotype, ignorance, fear and\n\
    xenophobia. This makes the short shrift supporters of multiculturalism\n\
    have given their concerns understandable and justified.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But events here and overseas have shown that some religious and cultural\n\
    minorities in western countries like Australia &ndash; recent migrants and\n\
    denizens of longer lineage &ndash; have sought to maintain more than the\n\
    sentimental aspects of their culture. Most confronting has been the\n\
    home-grown terrorists motivated by fanatical misogynist theocratic\n\
    values brought from other lands. The London bombers, the 17 men arrested\n\
    for conspiring to storm the Canadian parliament and bomb power plants in\n\
    Ontario, the group of Sydney and Melbourne men charged with\n\
    terrorism-related offences and Mohammed Bouyeri, the second generation\n\
    Dutch man who murdered progressive filmmaker Theo van Gogh all appeared\n\
    to be motivated by a parallel set of values fundamentally at odds with\n\
    those central to western democratic societies. Values they felt strongly\n\
    enough about to kill.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Ali, the Somali-born critic of Islam who was Bouyeri\xE2\x80\x99s next intended\n\
    target, argues that western citizens cannot afford to tolerate\n\
    sub-groups in the community with militant values that reject democracy\n\
    and the rule of law, and privilege group entitlements and solidarity\n\
    over individual rights. Tolerance of the intolerable, she suggests,\n\
    leads to the grievous oppression of women and puts them, and the\n\
    community as a whole, at risk of violence.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Her comments, made recently at the Commonwealth Club in California, were\n\
    about migrant communities, but they seem no less true when applied to\n\
    cultural and religious sub-groups with Anglo roots or long lineages in\n\
    Australia. If migrant groups are rightly prohibited from mutilating the\n\
    genitals of their girls in the name of culture and religion, why should\n\
    the refusal of non- migrant religious groups to hire women for\n\
    leadership positions because they are women or as teachers in their\n\
    schools because they are unmarried &ndash; both clear violations of state and\n\

  content: "The government is in trouble in the polls and the Prime Minister claims\r\n\
    there\xE2\x80\x99s no rabbits in the hat. Maybe, but I\xE2\x80\x99m skeptical. Both history\r\n\
    and early policy signs - the reduction of benefits available to new\r\n\
    migrants, the Federal government\xE2\x80\x99s consideration of a ban on HIV\r\n\
    positive migrants - suggests that as polling day draws closer, there\r\n\
    will be rabbits. The same ones that have been stewed before.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The multicultural \xE2\x80\x9Cwedge\xE2\x80\x9D is all about the so-called Howard Battlers,\r\n\
    the economically liberal, socially conservative swing voters shamelessly\r\n\
    courted by both major parties. Its existence reminds us how easy it is\r\n\
    to divide Australians over multiculturalism, though the real question is\r\n\
    why.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It would be silly to deny that fear of difference amongst segments of\r\n\
    the population, and its kissing cousin racism, play a role. But a\r\n\
    perception of unaddressed weaknesses in the multicultural credo may also\r\n\
    be to blame.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    At the heart of multiculturalism is an assertion about the positive\r\n\
    nature of difference and the benefits that homogenous societies gain by\r\n\
    accepting different religions, ethnic, racial, cultural, and linguistic\r\n\
    groups, and assisting them to maintain and share their knowledge,\r\n\
    perspectives and cultures. Behind such claims is the unarticulated\r\n\
    presumption that the only apects of culture that migrants seek to\r\n\
    preserve, and to share with the wider community, are those Ayaan Hirsi\r\n\
    Ali recently described as [sentimental]() language, music, culinary\r\n\
    traditions and cultural and religious rituals.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Australians opposed to the intake of non-Anglo migrants and the respect\r\n\
    afforded to such sentimental differences by cultural institutions like\r\n\
    schools and governments - the yearly outcry against cr&egrave;ches that\r\n\
    celebrate multiple religious festivals in December rather than just\r\n\
    Christmas is the classic - appear to be motivated by nothing more lofty\r\n\
    than racism, prejudice based on stereotype, ignorance, fear and\r\n\
    xenophobia. This makes the short shrift supporters of multiculturalism\r\n\
    have given their concerns understandable and justified.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But events here and overseas have shown that some religious and cultural\r\n\
    minorities in western countries like Australia - recent migrants and\r\n\
    denizens of longer lineage - have sought to maintain more than the\r\n\
    sentimental aspects of their culture. Most confronting has been the\r\n\
    home-grown terrorists motivated by fanatical misogynist theocratic\r\n\
    values brought from other lands. The London bombers, the 17 men arrested\r\n\
    for conspiring to storm the Canadian parliament and bomb power plants in\r\n\
    Ontario, the group of Sydney and Melbourne men charged with\r\n\
    terrorism-related offences and Mohammed Bouyeri, the second generation\r\n\
    Dutch man who murdered progressive filmmaker Theo van Gogh all appeared\r\n\
    to be motivated by a parallel set of values fundamentally at odds with\r\n\
    those central to western democratic societies. Values they felt strongly\r\n\
    enough about to kill.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Ali, the Somali-born critic of Islam who was Bouyeri\xE2\x80\x99s next intended\r\n\
    target, argues that western citizens cannot afford to tolerate\r\n\
    sub-groups in the community with militant values that reject democracy\r\n\
    and the rule of law, and privilege group entitlements and solidarity\r\n\
    over individual rights. Tolerance of the intolerable, she suggests,\r\n\
    leads to the grievous oppression of women and puts them, and the\r\n\
    community as a whole, at risk of violence.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Her comments, made recently at the Commonwealth Club in California, were\r\n\
    about migrant communities, but they seem no less true when applied to\r\n\
    cultural and religious sub-groups with Anglo roots or long lineages in\r\n\
    Australia. If migrant groups are rightly prohibited from mutilating the\r\n\
    genitals of their girls in the name of culture and religion, why should\r\n\
    the refusal of non- migrant religious groups to hire women for\r\n\
    leadership positions because they are women or as teachers in their\r\n\
    schools because they are unmarried - both clear violations of state and\r\n\
    federal anti-discrimination law - be allowed to stand? If we rail\r\n\
    against the misogynist violence-condoning theology preached by migrant\r\n\
    religious leaders like Sheik Taj Din al-Hilali, why should we turn a\r\n\
    blind a eye to the misogynist cant streaming from some fundamentalist\r\n\
    Christian and Jewish pulpits?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The preservation by religious, ethnic and cultural minorities of their\r\n\
    unique language, music, food, cultural and religious rituals - and the\r\n\
    sharing of these differences with the wider community - has enriched,\r\n\
    enlivened and enlarged Australian society. It is the positive fruits of\r\n\
    Australian multiculturalism of which we may feel justifiably proud.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But when minority groups preserve and seek to disseminate a parallel set\r\n\
    of deep values that preach - and lead to the practice of - oppression or\r\n\
    violence against Australians within the group and outside of it, we have\r\n\
    a problem. It doesn\xE2\x80\x99t matter if those preaching oppression and violence\r\n\

    What matters is the threat they pose to our security and the capacity of\r\n\
    every one of us, regardless of their gender or age, to exercise rights\r\n\
    and freedoms guaranteed by law.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So where does this leave the rabbits, and those who wish to defend them,\r\n\
    as electoral hunting season nears?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Not, I believe, without ammunition or a warren to defend. Racism is\r\n\

    doctors. Should Ms Broad\xE2\x80\x99s attempt to repeal abortion from the criminal\n\

  title: Support and Respect Gives IVF Parents Time to Tell
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:58:06
  content_markup: "<p>It\xE2\x80\x99s Time to Tell. The slogan is back, along with the second phase of\n\
    the Infertility Treatment Authority\xE2\x80\x99s campaign to inform parents of how\n\
    Victoria\xE2\x80\x99s infertility laws may affect their lives, and parenting\n\
    choices.</p>\n\n\
    <p>We\xE2\x80\x99ve learned a lot since the Telling Campaign got under way last year.\n\
    Then, the panic was about the legal rights of Victorian donors to\n\
    identifying information about any child born from their sperm or less\n\
    eggs. The problem was &ndash; and remains &ndash; that the majority of\n\
    donor-conceived kids don\xE2\x80\x99t know the truth about their conception. One\n\
    Victorian study found only 37% of parents had told their kids, while\n\
    international figures suggest that somewhere between 43% and 82% of\n\
    parents never intend to tell. As the first batch of kids affected by the\n\
    legislation turned 18, donors choosing to pursue their rights under the\n\
    law could have been the first to break the news to offspring that they\n\
    were donor-conceived.</p>\n\n\
    <p>As it turns out, much of that panic may have been misplaced. The truth\n\
    is that very little was &ndash; and still is &ndash; known about the motivations of\n\
    sperm donors. When modern infertility treatment methods were in their\n\
    infancy, donors tended to be young men motivated by money, and\n\
    appreciative of the anonymity that has long surrounded donation. But as\n\
    donor-conceived children began asserting a \xE2\x80\x9Cright to know,\xE2\x80\x9D donor\n\
    recruitment strategies began to change and with them, the motivational\n\
    profiles of donors.</p>\n\n\
    <p>A recent analysis of such changes suggests that when it comes to sperm\n\
    donors, you get what you pay for. If infertility treatment services\n\
    offer men a fee for service (something not allowed in Australia) and\n\
    guarantee them anonymity, they wind up with a pool of donors primarily\n\
    motivated by money and anxious to preserve their anonymity. If services\n\
    don\xE2\x80\x99t pay and require all donors to consent to being identified, they\n\
    tend to recruit older \xE2\x80\x9Cfamily men\xE2\x80\x9D with altruistic motivations and a\n\
    commitment to disclosure and openness.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So far, altruistic, respectful and compassionate appear to be good\n\
    descriptors of the pool of donors affected by Victoria\xE2\x80\x99s 1984\n\
    Infertility (Medical Procedures) Act. Descriptions that should perhaps\n\
    not be all that surprising given that since the middle of 1988, men\n\
    donating sperm in this state have known not just about their legal\n\
    rights to seek identifying information about resulting children, but\n\

  content: "It\xE2\x80\x99s Time to Tell. The slogan is back, along with the second phase of\r\n\
    the Infertility Treatment Authority\xE2\x80\x99s campaign to inform parents of how\r\n\
    Victoria\xE2\x80\x99s infertility laws may affect their lives, and parenting\r\n\
    choices.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    We\xE2\x80\x99ve learned a lot since the Telling Campaign got under way last year.\r\n\
    Then, the panic was about the legal rights of Victorian donors to\r\n\
    identifying information about any child born from their sperm or less\r\n\
    eggs. The problem was - and remains - that the majority of\r\n\
    donor-conceived kids don\xE2\x80\x99t know the truth about their conception. One\r\n\
    Victorian study found only 37% of parents had told their kids, while\r\n\
    international figures suggest that somewhere between 43% and 82% of\r\n\
    parents never intend to tell. As the first batch of kids affected by the\r\n\
    legislation turned 18, donors choosing to pursue their rights under the\r\n\
    law could have been the first to break the news to offspring that they\r\n\
    were donor-conceived.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    As it turns out, much of that panic may have been misplaced. The truth\r\n\
    is that very little was - and still is - known about the motivations of\r\n\
    sperm donors. When modern infertility treatment methods were in their\r\n\
    infancy, donors tended to be young men motivated by money, and\r\n\
    appreciative of the anonymity that has long surrounded donation. But as\r\n\
    donor-conceived children began asserting a \xE2\x80\x9Cright to know,\xE2\x80\x9D donor\r\n\
    recruitment strategies began to change and with them, the motivational\r\n\
    profiles of donors.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    A recent analysis of such changes suggests that when it comes to sperm\r\n\
    donors, you get what you pay for. If infertility treatment services\r\n\
    offer men a fee for service (something not allowed in Australia) and\r\n\
    guarantee them anonymity, they wind up with a pool of donors primarily\r\n\
    motivated by money and anxious to preserve their anonymity. If services\r\n\
    don\xE2\x80\x99t pay and require all donors to consent to being identified, they\r\n\
    tend to recruit older \xE2\x80\x9Cfamily men\xE2\x80\x9D with altruistic motivations and a\r\n\
    commitment to disclosure and openness.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So far, altruistic, respectful and compassionate appear to be good\r\n\
    descriptors of the pool of donors affected by Victoria\xE2\x80\x99s 1984\r\n\
    Infertility (Medical Procedures) Act. Descriptions that should perhaps\r\n\
    not be all that surprising given that since the middle of 1988, men\r\n\
    donating sperm in this state have known not just about their legal\r\n\
    rights to seek identifying information about resulting children, but\r\n\
    their obligations to disclose identifying information about themselves,\r\n\
    too.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The Infertility Treatment Authority has been evaluating the\r\n\
    effectiveness of the Time to Tell Campaign in informing parents of\r\n\

    Because there are two things I do know. One is that shame is corrosive\n\
    and, left unchallenged, takes years to undo.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The other is that according to one survey just over half of British\n\
    women intend to have plastic surgery, and 11% have done so already. In\n\
    Australia, around 50,000 people &ndash; mostly women, but a growing number of\n\

    <p>Might doesn\xE2\x80\x99t make right, but what such figures do imply is that if\n\
    face-lifts (liquid or solid) really do cross some moral dividing line,\n\
    we\xE2\x80\x99re going to have to unearth the motives of the traversing hordes to\n\
    get a fix on the problem, and find a solution.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In the meantime, if I can afford it, I\xE2\x80\x99m going to keep dodging my date\n\
    with destiny. I may even consider surgery some day.</p>\n\n\

    Because there are two things I do know. One is that shame is corrosive\r\n\
    and, left unchallenged, takes years to undo.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The other is that according to one survey just over half of British\r\n\
    women intend to have plastic surgery, and 11% have done so already. In\r\n\
    Australia, around 50,000 people - mostly women, but a growing number of\r\n\
    men - go under the knife each year, with 260,000 more undertaking\r\n\
    non-surgical procedures like Botox.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Might doesn\xE2\x80\x99t make right, but what such figures do imply is that if\r\n\
    face-lifts (liquid or solid) really do cross some moral dividing line,\r\n\
    we\xE2\x80\x99re going to have to unearth the motives of the traversing hordes to\r\n\
    get a fix on the problem, and find a solution.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In the meantime, if I can afford it, I\xE2\x80\x99m going to keep dodging my date\r\n\
    with destiny. I may even consider surgery some day.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    What I won\xE2\x80\x99t do is rabbit away the next time someone tells me I look\r\n\
    good for my age. The time for truth-telling has come."

  content_markup: "<p>It\xE2\x80\x99s far from over, with many still shouting. But as the conga line of\n\
    those condemning Channel 7 for broadcasting the news that two AFL\n\
    players had been referred for illicit drug use grows, we need to ask\n\
    ourselves: are we shooting the messenger?</p>\n\n\
    <p>The noisy majority contends that medical records are sacrosanct, and\n\
    that Seven behaved like slime not just by paying for such tainted goods,\n\
    but broadcasting their contents.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Let\xE2\x80\x99s look at the facts. On Friday the 24th, Seven reported that two\n\
    senior AFL players had been referred for drugs treatment under the\n\
    league\xE2\x80\x99s illicit drugs policy. The story came from medical records\n\
    provided by a couple in their thirties who claimed to have found them in\n\
    a gutter outside a rehabilitation centre, but were eventually arrested\n\
    for stealing them. The network had paid $3000 to obtain the documents. A\n\
    player boycott is now in force.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But while everyone agrees that medical records should remain\n\
    confidential, few have asked whether it is reasonable to assign the\n\
    obligation to achieve this to a television network.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Medical institutions and health professionals are certainly obliged to\n\
    respect patient confidentiality. Medical students learn early of their\n\
    duty not just to keep mum about what happens in the consulting room, but\n\
    to take all reasonable steps to ensure the contents of patient records\n\
    are not disclosed. This is not just because medical practitioners have\n\
    an obligation to foster the autonomy of their patients, but because they\n\
    recognise that people will only come forward for advice and treatment &ndash;\n\
    particularly about stigmatised conditions like abuse, mental illness and\n\
    substance use &ndash; if they know their secrets will be safe.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Are journalists obligated to keep patient records private, too? The\n\
    Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance\xE2\x80\x99s Code of Ethics notes that\n\
    journalists should \xE2\x80\x9Crespect\xE2\x80\xA6personal privacy\xE2\x80\x9D but offers little guidance\n\
    on how such respect should be demonstrated, or balanced against the\n\
    public interest. The Australian Communication and Media Authority\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    Guidelines stipulates that news and current affair programs must not use\n\
    material relating to a person\xE2\x80\x99s personal or private affairs, or which\n\
    invades an individual\xE2\x80\x99s privacy, other than where there is an\n\
    identifiable public interest reason for the material to be broadcast.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Journalists seem to agree that there was a case for running the story.\n\
    Last Thursday, senior journalist at the Australian Cameron Stewart\n\
    described it as a \xE2\x80\x9Ccracking yarn\xE2\x80\x9D that \xE2\x80\x9Cevery media outlet in Melbourne\n\
    would have reported\xE2\x80\xA6if it had come from the police, or the club, or from\n\
    the players themselves.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>The question then, is whether Channel 7 got the balance &ndash; between their\n\
    obligation to protect the privacy of the AFL players and their duty to\n\
    act in the public interest &ndash; right. Seven\xE2\x80\x99s Melbourne news director\n\
    Steve Carey contends that people at senior levels of sport who use\n\
    illicit drugs fail to provide role models for kids. This view drove his\n\
    decision to run the story, though he attempted to balance what he saw as\n\
    the public\xE2\x80\x99s right to know with the players\xE2\x80\x99 right to privacy by\n\
    omitting their names &ndash; though not the name of the club &ndash; from the\n\
    broadcast.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Was Carey right to prioritise the interests of his viewers in a full\n\
    picture of drug use in the AFL over the players\xE2\x80\x99 and League\xE2\x80\x99s interest\n\
    in non-disclosure?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Certainly, if I\xE2\x80\x98d been in Carey\xE2\x80\x99s shoes that fateful night, I would have\n\
    made a different call. I support the AFL\xE2\x80\x99s three strikes policy, which\n\
    appears to have been the indirect target of the story Seven put to air.\n\
    I would have prioritised the players\xE2\x80\x99 expectations of privacy over the\n\
    story, which I see as more of a \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\x9Dof interest to the public\" than \xE2\x80\x9Cin\n\
    the public interest\xE2\x80\x9D one.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But this is not the point. What matters is our acceptance that a\n\
    balancing act was required, even if we disagree with the judgment of the\n\
    balancer.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I\xE2\x80\x99m not trying to bury Seven, or to praise the network, either. My point\n\
    is simply that while we are right to feel angry about the unauthorized\n\
    disclosure of private medical records, we need to direct our anger\n\
    appropriately. Seven didn\xE2\x80\x99t steal the medical records, or negligently\n\
    allow them to be pinched. If they were ignorant of the fact they had\n\
    been stolen (a very key if), then the network had a very real moral\n\
    dilemma on its hands. One, it seems worth mentioning, that it and other\n\
    news organizations may face again.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Journalists are often in receipt of unauthorized information, the\n\

    <p>What happens when a journalist is leaked the records of a candidate for\n\

  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:57:40
  content_markup: "<p>Sex work is back in the news. Having hardly been broached in polite\n\
    conversation since the state government\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Ctolerance zone\xE2\x80\x9D policy for\n\
    street sex work went down in flames five years ago, the West Australian\n\
    government\xE2\x80\x99s decision to descriminalise and regulate indoor prostitution\n\
    has refocused minds around the country on the best way to manage the\n\
    world\xE2\x80\x99s oldest profession.</p>\n\n\
    <p>As a feminist academic and long-time St Kilda resident, I\xE2\x80\x99ve been\n\
    thinking about these issues for a long time. Only recently, however,\n\
    have I arrived at what I think is a fair and sensible approach to the\n\
    issue, one that recognises women as moral agents capable of accepting\n\
    both the rights and responsibilities associated with selling sex.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It looks like this.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Advocates and opponents of decriminalisation adopt extreme\n\
    characterisations of women to justify their positions. On one side are\n\
    the decriminalisation advocates &ndash; self-proclaimed unions or advocacy\n\
    groups for prostitutes &ndash; who contend that sex work is a job like any\n\
    other, that women have a right to perform this \xE2\x80\x9Cwork\xE2\x80\x9D whenever and\n\
    wherever they like, and that society is obliged to regulate to protect\n\
    sell-sellers from the inherent risks associated with having serial sex\n\
    with unknown men.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In the opposing corner are the radical feminists and members of the\n\
    religious right. For this unholy alliance, prostitution is always a\n\
    violent and exploitative encounter that, by definition, no competent\n\
    woman would ever choose to participate in. As two Norwegian scientists\n\
    put it, \xE2\x80\x9Cno-one wants to rent out her vagina as a garbage can for hordes\n\
    of anonymous men\xE2\x80\x99s ejaculations\xE2\x80\x9D. Dismissing with an imperious hand-wave\n\
    the claims of some prostitutes that they freely choose to sell their\n\
    bodies, real and pseudo radical feminists and religious wowsers persist\n\
    in describing all sex-sellers as victims whom they must protect by\n\
    promulgating and enforcing no- tolerance policies.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The victim-approach to managing street prostitution is objectionable on\n\
    a number of grounds. These include its obnoxious paternalism, and the\n\
    disingenuous way in which political agitation designed to impose the\n\
    agitator\xE2\x80\x99s view of what is best on everyone else is dressed up as\n\
    selfless \xE2\x80\x9Cfeminist\xE2\x80\x9D advocacy on behalf of women. But most offensive is\n\
    the way in which the argument itself victimises sex-sellers by denying\n\
    their experience and stripping them of their agency. Such\n\
    objectification allows the no-tolerance posse to dismiss everything\n\
    sex-sellers say about their experience &ndash; when they don\xE2\x80\x99t say things that\n\
    support the no-tolerance position &ndash; as false consciousness or further\n\
    evidence of victimhood. For instance, Gunilla Ekberg, the co-executive\n\
    director of the International Coalition Against Trafficking in Women,\n\
    explains the support some prostitutes give to decriminalization as\n\
    evidence of their desire to \xE2\x80\x9Cdefend their own dignity\xE2\x80\x9D in a violent\n\
    context that \xE2\x80\x9Cthey can\xE2\x80\x99t change\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Abandoning the all or nothing approach, and recognizing the indisputable\n\
    fact that some women do choose to sell sex, while others don\xE2\x80\x99t,\n\
    incarnates a realistic and fair approach for the management of indoor\n\
    and outdoor sex in liberal democracies. A position where sex sellers are\n\
    moral agents worthy of respect &ndash; instead of pitiable victims in need of\n\
    paternalistic protection &ndash; that have both rights and responsibilities\n\
    with regard to how they ply their trade. Insofar as the consequences of\n\
    their choice to sell sex remains with them, competent adult women (and\n\
    men) should be free to sell their bodies, however strongly some in the\n\
    community object. However, like other choosers, when the consequences of\n\
    the selling choice restricts the capacity of fellow citizens to exercise\n\
    their freedoms, the state is obligated to restrict their activity.</p>\n\n\
    <p>A focus on autonomous choice also justifies state intervention where sex\n\
    workers lack the capacity &ndash; because they are too young, mentally ill,\n\
    sexually or physically abused or drug addicted &ndash; to make choices about\n\
    selling sex that are worthy of the name.</p>\n\n\
    <p>What this cashes out to are policies that decriminalize and\n\
    constructively regulate indoor prostitution, and prohibit street\n\
    solicitation and sex. Behind this approach is a rebuttable presumption\n\
    that adult women who sell sex are autonomous, and that communities\n\
    affected by street sex suffer an unjustified loss of amenity and\n\
    security. Such policies address the very real potential for exploitation\n\
    and coercion in the sex trade by offering sex-sellers real opportunities\n\
    to exit like income support, places in drug rehabilitation programs and\n\
    police intervention in violent relationships at regular intervals at\n\
    their \xE2\x80\x9Cworkplaces\xE2\x80\x9D and each time they have contact with the law. The\n\
    availability of such programs to women working indoors should give us\n\
    confidence that sellers are choosing this way of life, while offering\n\
    street prostitutes &ndash; when combined with fines and jail terms for punters\n\
    &ndash; a real opportunity to either move inside or to exit the trade.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Women who are truly moral agents must accept both the rights and\n\
    responsibilities that accompany their choices. I think it vital that\n\
    public language and policy concerning women &ndash; particularly as sexual and\n\
    reproductive beings &ndash; validate us as citizens capable of both making\n\
    choices, and living with their consequences. Autonomous adult women have\n\
    a right to sell sex providing they go about it in ways that don\xE2\x80\x99t\n\
    unfairly burden the community of which they are a part, though as a\n\
    community we have a positive obligation to ensure that at every stage of\n\
    what is potentially a violent, exploitative and coercive game a woman\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    freedom to say \xE2\x80\x9Cno\xE2\x80\x9D is protected.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This is why allowing brothels to operate in a regulated fashion is a\n\
    good idea, but street sex work can never be tolerated. Not just because\n\
    a disproportionate number of street prostitutes are too young, too\n\
    drug-addicted, too psychologically scarred or cowed by violence or abuse\n\
    to make an autonomous choice to sell themselves, but because the cost to\n\
    the community of their behaviour, even if theirs is a choice worthy of\n\
    the name, is far too high.</p>\n"

    fact that some women do choose to sell sex, while others don\xE2\x80\x99t,\r\n\
    incarnates a realistic and fair approach for the management of indoor\r\n\
    and outdoor sex in liberal democracies. A position where sex sellers are\r\n\
    moral agents worthy of respect - instead of pitiable victims in need of\r\n\
    paternalistic protection - that have both rights and responsibilities\r\n\
    with regard to how they ply their trade. Insofar as the consequences of\r\n\
    their choice to sell sex remains with them, competent adult women (and\r\n\
    men) should be free to sell their bodies, however strongly some in the\r\n\
    community object. However, like other choosers, when the consequences of\r\n\
    the selling choice restricts the capacity of fellow citizens to exercise\r\n\
    their freedoms, the state is obligated to restrict their activity.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    A focus on autonomous choice also justifies state intervention where sex\r\n\
    workers lack the capacity - because they are too young, mentally ill,\r\n\
    sexually or physically abused or drug addicted - to make choices about\r\n\
    selling sex that are worthy of the name.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    What this cashes out to are policies that decriminalize and\r\n\
    constructively regulate indoor prostitution, and prohibit street\r\n\
    solicitation and sex. Behind this approach is a rebuttable presumption\r\n\
    that adult women who sell sex are autonomous, and that communities\r\n\
    affected by street sex suffer an unjustified loss of amenity and\r\n\
    security. Such policies address the very real potential for exploitation\r\n\
    and coercion in the sex trade by offering sex-sellers real opportunities\r\n\
    to exit like income support, places in drug rehabilitation programs and\r\n\
    police intervention in violent relationships at regular intervals at\r\n\
    their \xE2\x80\x9Cworkplaces\xE2\x80\x9D and each time they have contact with the law. The\r\n\
    availability of such programs to women working indoors should give us\r\n\
    confidence that sellers are choosing this way of life, while offering\r\n\
    street prostitutes - when combined with fines and jail terms for punters\r\n\
    - a real opportunity to either move inside or to exit the trade.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Women who are truly moral agents must accept both the rights and\r\n\
    responsibilities that accompany their choices. I think it vital that\r\n\
    public language and policy concerning women - particularly as sexual and\r\n\
    reproductive beings - validate us as citizens capable of both making\r\n\
    choices, and living with their consequences. Autonomous adult women have\r\n\
    a right to sell sex providing they go about it in ways that don\xE2\x80\x99t\r\n\
    unfairly burden the community of which they are a part, though as a\r\n\
    community we have a positive obligation to ensure that at every stage of\r\n\
    what is potentially a violent, exploitative and coercive game a woman\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    freedom to say \xE2\x80\x9Cno\xE2\x80\x9D is protected.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This is why allowing brothels to operate in a regulated fashion is a\r\n\
    good idea, but street sex work can never be tolerated. Not just because\r\n\
    a disproportionate number of street prostitutes are too young, too\r\n\
    drug-addicted, too psychologically scarred or cowed by violence or abuse\r\n\
    to make an autonomous choice to sell themselves, but because the cost to\r\n\
    the community of their behaviour, even if theirs is a choice worthy of\r\n\
    the name, is far too high."

  title: I Feel Guilty, My Son is at Public School
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:57:28
  content_markup: "<p>Ive been wanting to write this column all year, but dreading it, too.\n\
    Because I don\xE2\x80\x99t want to be misunderstood and I don\xE2\x80\x99t want to offend. But\n\
    the truth is that there is something horribly rotten going on in my\n\
    personal world and _ because the personal is political _ this nation.\n\
    The rot comes from the way we fund our schools. And it is making me so\n\
    angry (or is it so grief-stricken and guilty?) that I can hardly breath.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Federal Government\xE2\x80\x99s education policy, and that of the Rudd\n\
    Opposition, waxes lyrical about parental choice. But while most of the\n\
    parents I have known since our babies napped side by side at creche\n\
    ummed and ahed between private schools A, B and C _ and the one local\n\
    public school _ our finances meant that even though several of the\n\
    independent schools are just down the street from our house, my choice\n\
    was between the local public school and well, the local public school.\n\
    Some choice.</p>\n\n\
    <p>For every dollar the Federal Government spends on a child in public\n\
    school, $5.63 is expended on a child in a Catholic or other\n\
    non-government school. Among OECD countries, Australia ranks third in\n\
    the amount of public money spent on private education. In the last\n\
    budget, federal funding to private schools increased by $1.7 billion\n\
    over five years, while public got just $300 million over the same\n\
    period.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Despite the stark disparity of such figures, parents of public school\n\
    kids find it hard to cry foul. Mainly, I think, because of a fear that\n\
    doing so makes us look like we believe money is everything, and that\n\
    admitting the truth &ndash; that depriving public schools of funds makes\n\
    private schools \xE2\x80\x9Cbetter\xE2\x80\x9D &ndash; damages our kids\xE2\x80\x99 schools even more. The\n\
    truth is that public school teachers and administrators are the moral\n\
    heroes of our time, sewing more silk purses from the sow\xE2\x80\x99s ears of tatty\n\
    and diminishing resources than nearly any other group of professionals.\n\
    And there should be no underestimating the toughness of the job.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Look, I know that gardens, swimming pools, music rehearsal rooms, dining\n\
    areas, grassy quadrangles, polished floors, school-wide climate control\n\
    systems, post\xE2\x80\x931957 plumbing, regulation sized ovals and the organised\n\
    sporting teams that go with them aren\xE2\x80\x99t the heart and soul of a good\n\
    education. I know because my son\xE2\x80\x99s secondary school doesn\xE2\x80\x99t have any of\n\
    them.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But what about enough specialist teachers to ensure adequate interest\n\
    and diversity in the curriculum? Enough to craft the specialised\n\
    curriculum required by students at the top and bottom end of the bell\n\
    curve? Class sizes appropriate to the subject being taught? Can anyone\n\
    really suggest these are peripheral to the central function of secondary\n\
    schooling? Yet, here too, our school struggles.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The justice issues here are so acute they hurt. In what way do the 70\n\
    per cent of children attending public schools deserve to miss out on the\n\
    resources necessary for them to obtain the fundamentals of a good\n\
    education when the remaining 30 per cent get enough for this, and so\n\
    much more? Why do only the wealthiest parents in the community, and the\n\
    most religious, deserve a real choice about where they educate their\n\
    kids?</p>\n\n\
    <p>But what I really want to talk about is how it feels to be a parent who,\n\
    week after week, and _ as I look into the future _ year after year\n\
    watches her child trek out the door to spend all day in an institution\n\
    that try as it might (and it does really try) cannot meet his\n\
    educational needs. A parent who struggles daily with the worst of all\n\
    parental emotions: the feeling that she is letting her child _ this\n\
    beautiful, intelligent, eminently worthy creature whom she loves more\n\
    than life itself _ down.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Because while not a bad school, I always knew it was not the best school\n\
    for him. Not best for him because he loves art, but several of the art\n\
    teachers are known terrors. Not for him because he\xE2\x80\x99s passionate about\n\
    sport but there are no pitches or pools, coaches or competitions. Not\n\
    for him because he is a talented student and _ while there are signs of\n\
    change _ ideological resistance persists to catering for kids who need\n\
    extension rather than remediation.</p>\n\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CI want to go to Private School A,\xE2\x80\x9D he said a few months ago, after\n\
    hearing his closest friend rave about his school camp, curriculum\n\
    options and sporting tutelage. ``We can\xE2\x80\x99t afford it,&ldquo; I replied. He\n\
    won\xE2\x80\x99t ask again. He can see how frustrated I am at my inability to give\n\
    him the wonderful educational opportunities we both see dispensed like\n\
    lollies all round us; how sad and guilty I feel that despite the fact\n\
    that we are doing the best we can, our best isn\xE2\x80\x99t good enough. He knows\n\
    I need to stop thinking about, so I can breathe.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It doesn\xE2\x80\x99t have to be like this. True, the gleeful dismantling of the\n\
    public education system by the Howard Government seems more than OK by\n\
    Rudd\xE2\x80\x99s ALP, which recently pledged to preserve the inequitable funding\n\
    formulas that has caused this unjust mess. \xE2\x80\x9CNo [Schools] Hit List,\xE2\x80\x9D a\n\
    recent Labor press release trumpeted to The Parents Who Matter. But for\n\
    parents like me, there will be no Help List either. Instead, Kev has\n\
    offered to pay part of the cost of a laptop. Thankfully the Greens and\n\
    the Democrats have policies that are far better. Can you imagine how\n\
    different things would be,if the 70 per cent of parents whose children\n\
    would benefit from them sent first preferences their way?</p>\n"

    kids find it hard to cry foul. Mainly, I think, because of a fear that\r\n\
    doing so makes us look like we believe money is everything, and that\r\n\
    admitting the truth - that depriving public schools of funds makes\r\n\
    private schools \xE2\x80\x9Cbetter\xE2\x80\x9D - damages our kids\xE2\x80\x99 schools even more. The\r\n\
    truth is that public school teachers and administrators are the moral\r\n\
    heroes of our time, sewing more silk purses from the sow\xE2\x80\x99s ears of tatty\r\n\
    and diminishing resources than nearly any other group of professionals.\r\n\
    And there should be no underestimating the toughness of the job.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Look, I know that gardens, swimming pools, music rehearsal rooms, dining\r\n\
    areas, grassy quadrangles, polished floors, school-wide climate control\r\n\
    systems, post\xE2\x80\x931957 plumbing, regulation sized ovals and the organised\r\n\
    sporting teams that go with them aren\xE2\x80\x99t the heart and soul of a good\r\n\
    education. I know because my son\xE2\x80\x99s secondary school doesn\xE2\x80\x99t have any of\r\n\
    them.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But what about enough specialist teachers to ensure adequate interest\r\n\
    and diversity in the curriculum? Enough to craft the specialised\r\n\
    curriculum required by students at the top and bottom end of the bell\r\n\
    curve? Class sizes appropriate to the subject being taught? Can anyone\r\n\
    really suggest these are peripheral to the central function of secondary\r\n\
    schooling? Yet, here too, our school struggles.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The justice issues here are so acute they hurt. In what way do the 70\r\n\
    per cent of children attending public schools deserve to miss out on the\r\n\
    resources necessary for them to obtain the fundamentals of a good\r\n\
    education when the remaining 30 per cent get enough for this, and so\r\n\
    much more? Why do only the wealthiest parents in the community, and the\r\n\
    most religious, deserve a real choice about where they educate their\r\n\
    kids?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But what I really want to talk about is how it feels to be a parent who,\r\n\
    week after week, and \\_ as I look into the future \\_ year after year\r\n\
    watches her child trek out the door to spend all day in an institution\r\n\
    that try as it might (and it does really try) cannot meet his\r\n\
    educational needs. A parent who struggles daily with the worst of all\r\n\
    parental emotions: the feeling that she is letting her child \\_ this\r\n\
    beautiful, intelligent, eminently worthy creature whom she loves more\r\n\
    than life itself \\_ down.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Because while not a bad school, I always knew it was not the best school\r\n\
    for him. Not best for him because he loves art, but several of the art\r\n\
    teachers are known terrors. Not for him because he\xE2\x80\x99s passionate about\r\n\
    sport but there are no pitches or pools, coaches or competitions. Not\r\n\
    for him because he is a talented student and \\_ while there are signs of\r\n\
    change \\_ ideological resistance persists to catering for kids who need\r\n\
    extension rather than remediation.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CI want to go to Private School A,\xE2\x80\x9D he said a few months ago, after\r\n\
    hearing his closest friend rave about his school camp, curriculum\r\n\
    options and sporting tutelage. \\`\\`We can\xE2\x80\x99t afford it,\" I replied. He\r\n\
    won\xE2\x80\x99t ask again. He can see how frustrated I am at my inability to give\r\n\
    him the wonderful educational opportunities we both see dispensed like\r\n\
    lollies all round us; how sad and guilty I feel that despite the fact\r\n\
    that we are doing the best we can, our best isn\xE2\x80\x99t good enough. He knows\r\n\
    I need to stop thinking about, so I can breathe.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It doesn\xE2\x80\x99t have to be like this. True, the gleeful dismantling of the\r\n\
    public education system by the Howard Government seems more than OK by\r\n\
    Rudd\xE2\x80\x99s ALP, which recently pledged to preserve the inequitable funding\r\n\
    formulas that has caused this unjust mess. \xE2\x80\x9CNo [Schools] Hit List,\xE2\x80\x9D a\r\n\
    recent Labor press release trumpeted to The Parents Who Matter. But for\r\n\
    parents like me, there will be no Help List either. Instead, Kev has\r\n\
    offered to pay part of the cost of a laptop. Thankfully the Greens and\r\n\
    the Democrats have policies that are far better. Can you imagine how\r\n\
    different things would be,if the 70 per cent of parents whose children\r\n\
    would benefit from them sent first preferences their way?"

  title: A Man Worth Emulating
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:57:16
  content_markup: "<p><em>In our society, who best reflects Jesus\xE2\x80\x99 compassion and sense of\n\
    justice?</em></p>\n\n\
    <p>In recent years, courtesy of the Culture Wars, complaints about the\n\
    absence of Jesus, or Christianity more generally, from the gusto-filled\n\
    way Australians celebrate Christmas have crowded our newspapers and\n\
    clogged the airways. This year, In contrast, has been quieter. A pointed\n\
    indicator, perhaps, of the emphatic eviction of John Howard from the\n\
    Lodge, and the promise made by the new tenant of a kindler, gentler\n\
    approach to the demands of multi-cultural and multi-religious Australia.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So what better time for a secular Jew to talk about Jesus? To draw a\n\
    clear line under the terrible decade of narrow-mindedness, intolerance\n\
    and absolutism of the past decade by recalling who the historical figure\n\
    of Jesus of Nazareth was and what he sought to achieve. And, in so\n\
    doing, clear a space at everyone\xE2\x80\x99s holiday celebrations &ndash; religious,\n\
    secular or otherwise &ndash; to commemorate this justice-seeking defender of\n\
    the dispossessed.</p>\n\n\
    <p>A potted history of the life and time of Jesus would include the fact\n\
    that he was an outsider. Illegitimate and poor in a culture where a\n\
    man\xE2\x80\x99s standing and status among his fellows was entirely dependent on\n\
    his relationship with God. But the privilege of being seen in the eyes\n\
    of God as an Israelite, a member of the chosen people, was not available\n\
    to everyone. Certain people were ruled out on the basis of\n\
    characteristics they neither controlled nor could change &ndash; gender for\n\
    instance &ndash; while others, the sick and those involved in unclean\n\
    occupations like fishing or tanning, required purification to earn God\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    forgiveness, and so be welcomed back into the community of upright\n\
    citizens.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But the cost of forgiveness was high, and controlled by the Priestly\n\
    caste of Jews who ran the Temple in Jerusalem. Not only did all Jews at\n\
    that time pay a tithe to the Temple, they were also required to fork out\n\
    for individual rituals &ndash; incense- burning, the offering of loaves and\n\
    the sacrifice of animals &ndash; ordered to alleviate sin and guilt. But while\n\
    the Priests and their families were the sole beneficiaries of the\n\
    resulting largess, the penitent had no guarantees his offering would\n\
    achieve the desired ends. In fact, the failure of a sacrifice to cure an\n\
    infirmity might make matters worse, confirming God\xE2\x80\x99s continued judgement\n\
    of the sick person as beyond redemption.</p>\n\n\
    <p>That the Temple was corrupt was a widely held view at the time. Jesus\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    contribution was to imply that it was also unjust. As he criss-crossed\n\
    the Galilee offering forgiveness and healing to the unclean &ndash; those\n\
    literally cast outside the gates of their villages and towns to cleanse\n\
    spiritual pollution &ndash; his implicit claim was clear. A relationship with\n\
    God, and access to the Kingdom of Heaven, was open to all. That this\n\
    included women and others deemed inherently \xE2\x80\x9Cunclean\xE2\x80\x9D is evidenced not\n\
    just by his many female disciples and benefactors, but by Jesus\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    explicit rejection of notions of immutable male supremacy to which many\n\
    of his followers were attached. When, in the Gospel of Thomas, Simon\n\
    Peter calls for Jesus to dismiss Mary as disciple because she is \xE2\x80\x9Cnot\n\
    worthy of life,\xE2\x80\x9D Jesus replies that he will \xE2\x80\x9Cguide her to make her\n\
    male\xE2\x80\xA6for every female who makes herself male will enter heaven\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    kingdom\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>While clearly lacking a contemporary feminist sensibility, such remarks\n\
    were radical for the time, entertaining the possibility that those the\n\
    privileged and powerful deemed less than fully human (deservedly\n\
    marginalised and dispossessed, in other words) were capable of being\n\
    seen by God and of reaping all the social status and privileges this\n\
    entailed.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So who among our moral leaders is most like Jesus of Nazareth? Is it\n\
    President of Liberty Victoria\xE2\x80\x99s Julian Burnside QC who battles for the\n\
    rights of the poor to legal representation and for formal justice for\n\
    two of the most reviled groups in western societies: prisoners in\n\
    Guantanamo Bay and asylum seekers? Or Cardinal George Pell, who leads\n\
    the fight against the ordination of women and in a recent book of essays\n\
    accused Catholics who allowed their consciences to shape their values &ndash;\n\
    , rather than dictates from the Church hierarchy &ndash; of \xE2\x80\x9CDonald Duck\n\
    heresy\xE2\x80\x9D? Is Dr Jo Wainer, a woman who has dedicated much of her life to\n\
    fighting for legal and social recognition of women\xE2\x80\x99s full humanity, a\n\
    true disciple of Jesus? Or it is Danny Nalliah, President of Catch the\n\
    Fire Ministries and one-time Family First candidate, who asks his\n\
    parishioners to pray that God will \xE2\x80\x9Cpull down\xE2\x80\x9D what he calls <a href=\"\">Satan\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    strongholds</a> brothels, gambling places, bottle shops, mosques and\n\
    Freemasons, Buddhist, Hindu and other Temples?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Knowledge of the history of Jesus the man makes the answers clear.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Jesus of Nazareth was a spiritual activist and political radical who\n\
    made enormous personal sacrifices to bring his vision of a more\n\
    compassionate, inclusive and just world to fruition. It is those who\n\
    behave as Christians &ndash; a sometimes different group to those claiming to\n\

  content: "*In our society, who best reflects Jesus\xE2\x80\x99 compassion and sense of\r\n\
    justice?*\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In recent years, courtesy of the Culture Wars, complaints about the\r\n\
    absence of Jesus, or Christianity more generally, from the gusto-filled\r\n\
    way Australians celebrate Christmas have crowded our newspapers and\r\n\
    clogged the airways. This year, In contrast, has been quieter. A pointed\r\n\
    indicator, perhaps, of the emphatic eviction of John Howard from the\r\n\
    Lodge, and the promise made by the new tenant of a kindler, gentler\r\n\
    approach to the demands of multi-cultural and multi-religious Australia.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So what better time for a secular Jew to talk about Jesus? To draw a\r\n\
    clear line under the terrible decade of narrow-mindedness, intolerance\r\n\
    and absolutism of the past decade by recalling who the historical figure\r\n\
    of Jesus of Nazareth was and what he sought to achieve. And, in so\r\n\
    doing, clear a space at everyone\xE2\x80\x99s holiday celebrations - religious,\r\n\
    secular or otherwise - to commemorate this justice-seeking defender of\r\n\
    the dispossessed.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    A potted history of the life and time of Jesus would include the fact\r\n\
    that he was an outsider. Illegitimate and poor in a culture where a\r\n\
    man\xE2\x80\x99s standing and status among his fellows was entirely dependent on\r\n\
    his relationship with God. But the privilege of being seen in the eyes\r\n\
    of God as an Israelite, a member of the chosen people, was not available\r\n\
    to everyone. Certain people were ruled out on the basis of\r\n\
    characteristics they neither controlled nor could change - gender for\r\n\
    instance - while others, the sick and those involved in unclean\r\n\
    occupations like fishing or tanning, required purification to earn God\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    forgiveness, and so be welcomed back into the community of upright\r\n\
    citizens.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But the cost of forgiveness was high, and controlled by the Priestly\r\n\
    caste of Jews who ran the Temple in Jerusalem. Not only did all Jews at\r\n\
    that time pay a tithe to the Temple, they were also required to fork out\r\n\
    for individual rituals - incense- burning, the offering of loaves and\r\n\
    the sacrifice of animals - ordered to alleviate sin and guilt. But while\r\n\
    the Priests and their families were the sole beneficiaries of the\r\n\
    resulting largess, the penitent had no guarantees his offering would\r\n\
    achieve the desired ends. In fact, the failure of a sacrifice to cure an\r\n\
    infirmity might make matters worse, confirming God\xE2\x80\x99s continued judgement\r\n\
    of the sick person as beyond redemption.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    That the Temple was corrupt was a widely held view at the time. Jesus\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    contribution was to imply that it was also unjust. As he criss-crossed\r\n\
    the Galilee offering forgiveness and healing to the unclean - those\r\n\
    literally cast outside the gates of their villages and towns to cleanse\r\n\
    spiritual pollution - his implicit claim was clear. A relationship with\r\n\
    God, and access to the Kingdom of Heaven, was open to all. That this\r\n\
    included women and others deemed inherently \xE2\x80\x9Cunclean\xE2\x80\x9D is evidenced not\r\n\
    just by his many female disciples and benefactors, but by Jesus\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    explicit rejection of notions of immutable male supremacy to which many\r\n\
    of his followers were attached. When, in the Gospel of Thomas, Simon\r\n\
    Peter calls for Jesus to dismiss Mary as disciple because she is \xE2\x80\x9Cnot\r\n\
    worthy of life,\xE2\x80\x9D Jesus replies that he will \xE2\x80\x9Cguide her to make her\r\n\
    male\xE2\x80\xA6for every female who makes herself male will enter heaven\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    kingdom\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    While clearly lacking a contemporary feminist sensibility, such remarks\r\n\
    were radical for the time, entertaining the possibility that those the\r\n\
    privileged and powerful deemed less than fully human (deservedly\r\n\
    marginalised and dispossessed, in other words) were capable of being\r\n\
    seen by God and of reaping all the social status and privileges this\r\n\
    entailed.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So who among our moral leaders is most like Jesus of Nazareth? Is it\r\n\
    President of Liberty Victoria\xE2\x80\x99s Julian Burnside QC who battles for the\r\n\
    rights of the poor to legal representation and for formal justice for\r\n\
    two of the most reviled groups in western societies: prisoners in\r\n\
    Guantanamo Bay and asylum seekers? Or Cardinal George Pell, who leads\r\n\
    the fight against the ordination of women and in a recent book of essays\r\n\
    accused Catholics who allowed their consciences to shape their values -\r\n\
    , rather than dictates from the Church hierarchy - of \xE2\x80\x9CDonald Duck\r\n\
    heresy\xE2\x80\x9D? Is Dr Jo Wainer, a woman who has dedicated much of her life to\r\n\
    fighting for legal and social recognition of women\xE2\x80\x99s full humanity, a\r\n\
    true disciple of Jesus? Or it is Danny Nalliah, President of Catch the\r\n\
    Fire Ministries and one-time Family First candidate, who asks his\r\n\
    parishioners to pray that God will \xE2\x80\x9Cpull down\xE2\x80\x9D what he calls [Satan\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    strongholds]() brothels, gambling places, bottle shops, mosques and\r\n\
    Freemasons, Buddhist, Hindu and other Temples?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Knowledge of the history of Jesus the man makes the answers clear.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Jesus of Nazareth was a spiritual activist and political radical who\r\n\
    made enormous personal sacrifices to bring his vision of a more\r\n\
    compassionate, inclusive and just world to fruition. It is those who\r\n\
    behave as Christians - a sometimes different group to those claiming to\r\n\
    be them - who keep Jesus\xE2\x80\x99s radical, truth-seeking, cage-rattling, spirit\r\n\
    alive\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So, as we head off to the beach this summer for a well-earned rest, let\r\n\
    us remember to honour our modern day Jesus of Nazarereths: the men and\r\n\
    women who find inequity offensive, and fight for justice for the most\r\n\
    benighted in our community, often at great personal, professional and\r\n\
    financial costs. And let us find time to consider how, when 2008 rolls\r\n\
    around, we might engage in a bit of radical, truth-seeking cage-rattling\r\n\
    of our own. The sort of cage-rattling designed to make a real difference\r\n\
    for one of the oppressed, marginalised, forgotten or dispossessed groups\r\n\
    in the Australian community who quietly thirst for justice.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The sort of cage-rattling that might just turn 2008 into a year to make\r\n\
    Jesus proud."

    Christmas, even explosive ones about the questionable withdrawal of\n\
    life-sustaining treatment from unconscious patients like Paulo Melo.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But we need to remember twenty-nine year old Paulo, critically injured\n\
    in a car accident in Kakadu National Park on December 5th. Just under\n\
    two weeks later, his family were in court, resisting the hospital\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    decision to discontinue life support. They failed, and on December 19th\n\
    Paulo\xE2\x80\x99s treatment was withdrawn. He died around 16 hours later.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Disputes between doctors and families about the advisability of\n\
    continuing treatment in such circumstances are rare. Families that\n\
    reject medical advice tend to be either deeply religious, struggling to\n\
    come to grips emotionally with the tragedy they face, or convinced\n\
    they\xE2\x80\x99ve witnessed signs of recovery that doctors &ndash; having already handed\n\
    down their prognosis &ndash; refuse to countenance.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Melos, who had a Priest by their son\xE2\x80\x99s bed in his final hours, who\n\
    begged the hospital to let Paulo survive until after Christmas or New\n\
    Year and then \xE2\x80\x9Cwe can see,\xE2\x80\x9D and who insisted to the end that Paulo was\n\
    showing signs of recovery, could fairly be described as all three. There\n\
    is little doubt their determination to preserve Paulo\xE2\x80\x99s life exasperated\n\
    the medical team at the Royal Darwin Hospital. \xE2\x80\x9CWe have tried in every\n\
    way to prepare this family for the withdrawal of the mechanical\n\
    ventilation,\xE2\x80\x9D Dr Diane Stevens was quoted at the final hearing as\n\
    saying. \xE2\x80\x9CWe have already\xE2\x80\xA6given [them] more than a week to understand\n\
    that he is not going to survive this terrible accident and injuries\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>For Dr Stevens, the medical prognosis was clear, and justified the\n\
    Hospital\xE2\x80\x99s decision to withdraw treatment from Paulo. \xE2\x80\x9C[The medical\n\
    team] felt strongly that we could not continue the mechanical\n\
    ventilation as it was futile therapy,\xE2\x80\x9D she told the court in a sworn\n\
    statement. \xE2\x80\x9CWe feel strongly it is not ethical to continue with futile\n\
    therapy\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Justice Mildren of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory appeared\n\
    convinced, citing the futility of further treatment as one of the\n\
    grounds for denying a continuation of the orders restraining the\n\
    hospital from withdrawing Paulo\xE2\x80\x99s life support. \xE2\x80\x9CThe difficulty here is\n\
    that the only evidence before me suggests that continuing with the\n\
    current treatment of this patient is futile\xE2\x80\xA6There is no evidence to the\n\
    contrary\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Everyone, doctors most of all, know there comes a point when patients\n\
    are overmastered by their disease and medicine is powerless to\n\
    intervene. The problem has been defining this point with the precision,\n\
    accuracy and ethical cogency required to guide clinical behaviour.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Is treatment one with a 1% chance of success \xE2\x80\x9Cfutile\xE2\x80\x9D, or does one with\n\
    a 10% chance qualify? And how, and by whom, should such vital\n\
    probabilities be calculated? Research warns doctors against relying on\n\
    their experience, which is biased towards recollection of cases that\n\
    went wrong, but robust and reliable data is often lacking. Even where it\n\
    exists, its relevance to particular cases is not always clear. And\n\
    doctors can be wrong. In 2000 the courts had to twice restrain those at\n\
    Sydney\xE2\x80\x99s Royal Prince Alfred Hospital from withdrawing \xE2\x80\x9Cfutile\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    treatment from a comatose 37 year old man whose sister, keeping vigil at\n\
    the bedside, insisted was improving. The man eventually recovered.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Perhaps most critically, medical futility does not provide a values-free\n\
    tool by which medicos &ndash; and courts &ndash; can make objective decisions about\n\
    withdrawing treatment. Instead, it but a mechanism by which medical\n\
    values are allowed to trump those held by non-compliant families of\n\
    critically ill patients. In a recent edition of the British Medical\n\
    Journal, Charles Weijer and Carol Elliott explain how clashes between\n\
    doctors and families over withdrawing treatment are \xE2\x80\x9Cnot about the\n\
    probability that an intervention will work but about the goals that it\n\
    will serve\xE2\x80\x9D. For some families, human life &ndash; even unconscious life &ndash; is\n\
    of greater value than considerations of that life\xE2\x80\x99s quality. In this\n\
    context, the medical ethicists argue, describing as \xE2\x80\x9Cfutile\xE2\x80\x9D treatments\n\
    that preserve what may be permanently unconscious life is \xE2\x80\x9Csuspiciously\n\
    like trying to redefine a debate about conflicting values into a debate\n\
    about medical probabilities. And as doctors are generally the sole\n\
    arbiters of medical probability this amounts to saying to families,\n\
    `Your values don\xE2\x80\x99t count\xE2\x80\x99\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Luckily, there is a better way.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Since the late 1990s, a bevy of experts have been arguing that our\n\
    inability to define futility objectively requires us to focus on\n\
    developing a fair process for reaching decisions about withdrawing\n\
    treatment. The American Medical Association, for instance, advocates\n\
    that every institution develop and adhere to such a policy, which should\n\
    include joint decision-making, negotiated resolution of disagreements\n\
    and, if when all else fails, opportunities for families to transfer care\n\
    of their loved one to another doctor. Only when no doctor or hospital\n\
    will accept the patient, may treatment be withdrawn.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The aim of such a policy is not to resolve the values conflict at the\n\
    heart of disagreements about withdrawing treatments, but to ensure the\n\

  content: "Something worrying is happening to column readers. They are becoming\r\n\
    rude. Menacingly rude - and just plain mean - when they don\xE2\x80\x99t agree with\r\n\
    you.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Get a load of this. \xE2\x80\x9CYour article was stupid. How dare you leave out\r\n\
    [thing I felt was really important here]. You are totally unethical and\r\n\
    should not be allowed to write in the newspaper ever again\xE2\x80\x9D. Or this\r\n\
    one. \xE2\x80\x9CYou liar! I have forwarded your article to all my friends so they\r\n\

    Perhaps the problem is the role models.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The tabloids have always done it, but in the last few years, the quality\r\n\
    papers have also begun running columnists who describe those who do, say\r\n\
    or believe things they don\xE2\x80\x99t agree with as stupid, obnoxious, smug,\r\n\
    selfish, ignorant, idiots, yobs, whackers, louts, fools, barbarians and\r\n\
    harpies.\r\n\
    \r\n\

    is simple: it gets readers going. And there seems little argument that\r\n\
    this is true. Technology takes the guess work out of how many times such\r\n\

    <p>Like most of us, he could produce reasons: the incompatibility of the\n\

    grief and self-loathing about opportunities lost were palpable.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Some of us have no choice but to sell ourselves short. Perhaps we are\n\

    children are incompatible with ours, and must take precedence in the\n\
    short or long term.</p>\n\n\
    <p>For others, however, the picture is less clear. Research conducted over\n\
    decades confirms that beyond the level of income needed to fulfil our\n\
    basic needs, additional income does not increase our life satisfaction.\n\
    Yet despite this, many of us work longer hours than we want at jobs we\n\
    despise in the desperate hope that one more purchase &ndash; the jaunty sports\n\
    car, the renovations, the new dress &ndash; will finally deliver the happiness\n\
    our consumerist culture promises (to make matters worse, rises in income\n\
    may transitorily increase our satisfaction, potentially prompting us to\n\

    <p>Defining our own good, and living our lives in pursuit of it, is at the\n\
    heart of a moral life. Aristotle thought that developing one\xE2\x80\x99s skills\n\
    and talents was essential to the project of living a virtuous life,\n\
    which he understood as synonymous with the pursuit of happiness.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Most of us know that the best way to get the measure of our own lives is\n\
    to imagine ourselves on our deathbeds looking back at our choices and\n\
    deeds. What will we judge as worthy of our time and effort, and what a\n\
    waste of both? Which journeys and detours will we cherish, and which\n\
    will we regret?</p>\n\n\

    consider it. Even in the wake of George\xE2\x80\x99s confession that night in the\n\

    to the beat, while two others simultaneously noticed our empty pots and\n\

    and bum up in the hope that the quantity rather than quality of our\n\

  title: One-Size-Fits-All Marriage Model Fails to Bind
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:56:52
  content_markup: "<p>It\xE2\x80\x99s built into our psyches. How could it not be, with marriage &ndash; and\n\
    the implied happy-ever-after &ndash; concluding every literary and cinematic\n\
    romantic tale? And then there\xE2\x80\x99s the return of the elaborate, often white\n\
    wedding, costing on average (based on 2004 figures) $36,234. Social\n\
    research shows it, too. We, as a nation, particularly those in our\n\
    dotage, and those in our thirties, believe in the institution of\n\
    marriage.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Our divorce rate only confirms this, if you consider that 56% of\n\
    Australian men, and 45% of women have, or eventually will, tie the knot\n\
    again.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So are we idealists or mugs?</p>\n\n\
    <p>My verdict is mugs. Yes, the one-size-fits-all definition of marriage as\n\
    a lifelong romantic union of choice with \xE2\x80\x9Cthe one\xE2\x80\x9D person able to meet\n\
    our every emotional, intellectual and sexual need suits some. But for\n\
    others it is a recipe for disaster.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I can count the number of happy couples I know &ndash; or knew &ndash; on a single\n\
    digit. But for many the dissatisfactions are not global, but particular,\n\
    boiling down to malcontent in one key area, with the remaining\n\
    fundamentals solid. Despite this, and often amid cries of \xE2\x80\x9Cdon\xE2\x80\x99t go for\n\
    second best\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cyou deserve better,\xE2\x80\x9D one or both partners will call it\n\
    quits. In the aftermath, many will blame themselves for failing to be\n\
    for their partner, or to have found in them, their everything.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But are we failing at marriage, or is marriage failing us? If we stopped\n\
    blaming ourselves for failing to suit marriage, and started asking why\n\
    marriage doesn\xE2\x80\x99t better suit us, would more of us stay together?</p>\n\n\

  content: "It\xE2\x80\x99s built into our psyches. How could it not be, with marriage - and\r\n\
    the implied happy-ever-after - concluding every literary and cinematic\r\n\
    romantic tale? And then there\xE2\x80\x99s the return of the elaborate, often white\r\n\
    wedding, costing on average (based on 2004 figures) $36,234. Social\r\n\
    research shows it, too. We, as a nation, particularly those in our\r\n\
    dotage, and those in our thirties, believe in the institution of\r\n\
    marriage.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Our divorce rate only confirms this, if you consider that 56% of\r\n\
    Australian men, and 45% of women have, or eventually will, tie the knot\r\n\
    again.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So are we idealists or mugs?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    My verdict is mugs. Yes, the one-size-fits-all definition of marriage as\r\n\
    a lifelong romantic union of choice with \xE2\x80\x9Cthe one\xE2\x80\x9D person able to meet\r\n\
    our every emotional, intellectual and sexual need suits some. But for\r\n\
    others it is a recipe for disaster.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I can count the number of happy couples I know - or knew - on a single\r\n\
    digit. But for many the dissatisfactions are not global, but particular,\r\n\
    boiling down to malcontent in one key area, with the remaining\r\n\
    fundamentals solid. Despite this, and often amid cries of \xE2\x80\x9Cdon\xE2\x80\x99t go for\r\n\
    second best\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cyou deserve better,\xE2\x80\x9D one or both partners will call it\r\n\
    quits. In the aftermath, many will blame themselves for failing to be\r\n\
    for their partner, or to have found in them, their everything.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But are we failing at marriage, or is marriage failing us? If we stopped\r\n\
    blaming ourselves for failing to suit marriage, and started asking why\r\n\
    marriage doesn\xE2\x80\x99t better suit us, would more of us stay together?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I say, \xE2\x80\x9Cyes\xE2\x80\x9D. Marriage was designed to serve a number of purposes, but\r\n\

    re-partnering which may distract children from focusing on - and parents\r\n\
    from supporting - their project of growing up.\r\n\
    \r\n\

    right for you to send your child to a selective school, if she gets in?</p>\n\n\
    <p>This dilemma is all too real. Recently, I read of a couple who were\n\
    frank about their capacity to afford a top private education for their\n\
    son, but moved into the zone of the state\xE2\x80\x99s top public school so they\n\
    could renovate their house, build a swimming pool and avoid becoming\n\
    workforce slaves so they could spend more time with their kids.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Are such choices right? Fair? Does the mere asking of such questions &ndash;\n\
    guaranteed to foster a fractious and divisive debate about personal\n\
    ethics &ndash; signal the success of State and Federal government strategy to\n\
    wedge the community on the schools issue to distract from their woeful\n\
    neglect of public education and its tragic consequence: the failure to\n\
    provide every child with local public schools able to deliver the\n\
    education they need and deserve?</p>\n\n\
    <p>I think the latter. OK, it\xE2\x80\x99s true. I feel uncomfortable about parents\n\
    choosing to renovate and build a pool instead of paying private school\n\
    fees, but have sympathy for those wishing to work less and spend more\n\
    time with their kids. And I can\xE2\x80\x99t help but admire the decision of a now\n\
    wealthy friend from a middle-class background not to sit his bright\n\
    child for the entry test for the selective high school he credits with\n\
    his success because he wants the place to go to a child in need.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But these are my values, and yours may be different. And the truth is\n\
    that pondering what individuals of conscience do in unconscionable\n\
    situations is not the best way to solve this country\xE2\x80\x99s neglect of our\n\
    children\xE2\x80\x99s educational needs.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Instead, what we need is a paradigm shift. Away from a view of children\n\
    as private possessions (the benefits of which reside solely with their\n\
    parents) and towards one that recognizes them as a public good. Viewed\n\
    this way, the moral problem shifts away from the adequacy of particular\n\
    parents\xE2\x80\x99 sacrifice, and towards the moral obligations of employers and\n\
    governments (which regularly wax eloquent about the need for couples to\n\
    reproduce early and often) to invest in the education of this country\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    future citizens and workforce.</p>\n\n\
    <p>And the investment currently being made is inadequate, with the Federal\n\
    Government\xE2\x80\x99s own ministerial taskforce making clear that without $2.9\n\
    billion more each year, public schools will be unable to meet what\n\
    Education Ministers of all State, Territory and Commonwealth governments\n\
    agreed were the very goals of schooling in the 21st century.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I think it\xE2\x80\x99s true to say that if the school best placed to meet our\n\
    child\xE2\x80\x99s academic needs was around the corner and free, most of us would\n\
    send our child there.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This makes the key moral question: why can\xE2\x80\x99t most of us say this about\n\
    our local schools, and what &ndash; as a nation &ndash; do we intend to do about it?</p>\n"

    this way, the moral problem shifts away from the adequacy of particular\r\n\
    parents\xE2\x80\x99 sacrifice, and towards the moral obligations of employers and\r\n\
    governments (which regularly wax eloquent about the need for couples to\r\n\
    reproduce early and often) to invest in the education of this country\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    future citizens and workforce.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    And the investment currently being made is inadequate, with the Federal\r\n\
    Government\xE2\x80\x99s own ministerial taskforce making clear that without $2.9\r\n\
    billion more each year, public schools will be unable to meet what\r\n\
    Education Ministers of all State, Territory and Commonwealth governments\r\n\
    agreed were the very goals of schooling in the 21st century.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I think it\xE2\x80\x99s true to say that if the school best placed to meet our\r\n\
    child\xE2\x80\x99s academic needs was around the corner and free, most of us would\r\n\
    send our child there.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This makes the key moral question: why can\xE2\x80\x99t most of us say this about\r\n\
    our local schools, and what - as a nation - do we intend to do about it?"

    Australians have the potential to be. The other &ndash; his literal shadow &ndash;\n\
    excusing, justifying, insisting on his version of the truth and in so\n\

    <p>The trick of oppression is to dehumanise the victim. When a dehumanised\n\

    <p>Dehumanisation, argues Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela, a former member of South\n\

    of the trauma suffered by the oppressed.</p>\n\n\
    <p>She illustrates this claim with the story of a black South African man\n\
    whose wife was killed by the Pan Africanist Congress while they sat\n\

  content: "Talk about giving with one hand and taking with the other! There, in\r\n\
    Parliament House, with members of the Stolen Generations looking on and\r\n\
    thousands more bearing witness via video link on the adjacent lawns. One\r\n\
    man, representing the nation, validating the painful experiences of\r\n\
    Aboriginal Australians and by so doing, reminding us of what we as\r\n\
    Australians have the potential to be. The other - his literal shadow -\r\n\
    excusing, justifying, insisting on his version of the truth and in so\r\n\
    doing, painfully reminding us why progress on race relations in this\r\n\
    country have been stalled for so long.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The trick of oppression is to dehumanise the victim. When a dehumanised\r\n\
    group is made \xE2\x80\x9Cother,\xE2\x80\x9D using, abusing or even killing its members\r\n\
    doesn\xE2\x80\x99t seem so wrong. The Nazis described Jews as rats and, when\r\n\
    discussing the numbers on trains heading for Auschwitz, as rags. Even\r\n\
    today, Blacks still suffer the occasional insult - commonplace in years\r\n\
    gone by - of being likened to animals.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Dehumanisation, argues Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela, a former member of South\r\n\
    Africa\xE2\x80\x99s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, is one of the main causes\r\n\
    of the trauma suffered by the oppressed.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    She illustrates this claim with the story of a black South African man\r\n\
    whose wife was killed by the Pan Africanist Congress while they sat\r\n\
    side-by-side in church. \xE2\x80\x9CMy wife was wearing a long blue coat,\xE2\x80\x9D the man\r\n\
    sobbed when finally coming face to face with the killers during South\r\n\
    Africa\xE2\x80\x99s truth and reconciliation process. \xE2\x80\x9CPlease tell me, do you\r\n\

    because \xE2\x80\x9Cthere is no danger or disadvantages to GM canola,\xE2\x80\x9D it\xE2\x80\x99s hard to\r\n\
    trust that the recommendations made by the reviews have to manage the\r\n\
    introduction of the technology into Australia have the protection of\r\n\
    non-GM enthusiasts forefront in their minds.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The thing about food is just that: it\xE2\x80\x99s food. We baste and sprinkle and\r\n\
    flamb&eacute; it, but in the end food must be honoured as a gift from\r\n\
    the planet essential t our survival. For some, the preciousness of food\r\n\
    leads to the adoption of the precautionary principle when it comes to\r\n\
    GM: a nay-saying born of a fear that the indeterminate risks of the\r\n\
    technology to human health and welfare could be so high, we need to turn\r\n\
    away.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But we don\xE2\x80\x99t need to say, no. We just need to ensure governments stay\r\n\
    true to their word that in the brave new world of GM food, we\xE2\x80\x99ll all\r\n\
    have a choice."

    snatched after disputes about burial between non-indigenous and Maori\n\
    relatives. The distress of Ms Ngahooro\xE2\x80\x99s family was extensively covered\n\
    in the New Zealand press, with the will\xE2\x80\x99s executor, niece Trish Scoble,\n\
    saying that the loss of the body made her feel both \xE2\x80\x9Csick\xE2\x80\x9D and\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cfrightened\xE2\x80\x9D. Scoble said that she would not stop until her Auntie May\n\
    was laid to rest as she had wanted.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The body snatching cases raises interesting legal issues. One is that\n\
    because New Zealand (like Australia) does not recognize bodies as\n\
    property, the unauthorized removal of Ngahooro\xE2\x80\x99s remains did not\n\
    constitute theft or justify police intervention (though lawmakers in New\n\
    Zealand now appear ready to change this).</p>\n\n\
    <p>The moral issues are just as compelling. For some, the Auntie May case\n\
    was a storm in a teacup. Who cared where the woman was buried? Auntie\n\
    May wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t because she was dead.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But is it really that simple? Can we simply disregard the wishes of the\n\
    deceased? Or are there things we owe to the dead?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Many moral thinkers, including Aristotle and Confucius, believed we did\n\
    have obligations to the dead. Every time we refuse to speak ill of them\n\
    or work to carry out their last wishes or insist they get justice when\n\
    their demise was the result of foul play, we strenuously agree.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But while we know that it would be wrong to override Dad\xE2\x80\x99s request to be\n\
    an organ donor or for staff at the morgue to violate Mum\xE2\x80\x99s body, it\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    hard to explain why. After all, being dead, neither Dad nor Mum are\n\
    likely to care.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But the end of a body doesn\xE2\x80\x99t mean the end of a relationship. Just\n\
    because my mother\xE2\x80\x99s dead doesn\xE2\x80\x99t mean she\xE2\x80\x99s not my mother. So while the\n\
    relationship demands of the dead are few, what demands there are can be\n\
    said to create obligations in the living.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In the same way that relationships carry forward beyond death, so too do\n\
    the interests of the dead person. It\xE2\x80\x99s not hard to see why dead people\n\
    would maintain an interest in the fate of their body and organs, and the\n\
    protection of their memory, legacy and reputation. The law recognizes\n\
    these things by enforcing the terms of the deceased\xE2\x80\x99s will.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The fact that the dead won\xE2\x80\x99t know of our failure to protect their\n\
    interests doesn\xE2\x80\x99t mean those interests don\xE2\x80\x99t exist, and our failure\n\
    doesn\xE2\x80\x99t count. If you pledge fidelity to your partner when you marry,\n\
    then sleeping with someone else make you a cheat and causes your partner\n\
    hurt, even if they never find out. And if you don\xE2\x80\x99t scatter Dad\xE2\x80\x99s ashes\n\
    in the Blue Mountains like he asked, the fact that he\xE2\x80\x99ll never know\n\
    doesn\xE2\x80\x99t mean he wasn\xE2\x80\x99t harmed when you let him down.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The upshot? That even if the dead don\xE2\x80\x99t know we\xE2\x80\x99ve harmed them, they\n\
    have legitimate interests that can be harmed. These interests are ones\n\
    those of us bound by relationship to the dead are obligated to defend.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Of course, many of the laws and customs surrounding death protect the\n\

  title: Stripped bare, Spitzer affair raises big question
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:55:36
  content_markup: "<p>The facts are simple. Elliot Spitzer, who fought organised crime and\n\
    corruption on Wall Street, resigned last week as New York\xE2\x80\x99s Governor\n\
    after Federal wiretaps caught him arranging to meet an out-of-town\n\
    hooker in his DC hotel.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It was the Mann Act of 1910 that brought Spitzer down. In its current\n\
    incarnation &ndash; the US Congress amended it in 1978 and again in 1986 &ndash; the\n\
    statute prohibits the transportation of people across state lines for\n\
    the purpose of prostitution.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Out of a job, his chance at a future run at the Presidency dashed, and\n\
    facing 20 years jail if convicted, you have to ask: what was the man\n\
    thinking? I\xE2\x80\x99m not sure, though one thing he did make clear during the\n\
    press conferences clocking his demise was that the answer was none of\n\
    our business. His behaviour was a \xE2\x80\x9Cprivate matter,\xE2\x80\x9D and his \xE2\x80\x9Cfailings\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    were private, too.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t agree more. If Spitzer says &ndash; which he does &ndash; that he failed\n\
    his Harvard-trained attorney wife Silda, his children and his entire\n\
    family by sleeping with a prostitute, who am I to disagree? But I once\n\
    lived and worked in New York and if I still did, I wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t think for a\n\
    moment that he had failed me.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I would feel the same about an Australian politician in Spitzer\xE2\x80\x99s shoes,\n\
    though in New South Wales and Victoria it would be unlikely that such an\n\
    official would ever be charged. Indoor commercial sex was decriminalised\n\
    n NSW, and partially legalised in Victoria, years ago. Among the reasons\n\
    why is the distaste small-l liberals feel for the state sticking its\n\
    beak into people\xE2\x80\x99s private affairs. What two consenting adults get up to\n\
    in bed is no one\xE2\x80\x99s business but their own.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Those on board &ndash; or should I say in bed? &ndash; with this philosophy may feel\n\
    that Spitzer\xE2\x80\x99s exit from public life is a shame, given all he had given\n\
    to it. So he had sex with a prostitute. How exactly does this impact on\n\
    his ability to do his job?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Americans may be wondering about this, too. Throughout the semen stains,\n\
    cigar speculations and impeachment proceedings that constituted the\n\
    Lewinsky affair, roughly 75% told pollsters they thought Bill Clinton\n\
    was fit to govern, and should remain as President.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But isn\xE2\x80\x99t it wrong for those meant to uphold the law to break it?\n\
    Absolutely. Doesn\xE2\x80\x99t Spitzer\xE2\x80\x99s behaviour show a failure of judgment or an\n\
    arrogant belief that he wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t be caught? Yep. Doesn\xE2\x80\x99t his zealous\n\
    pursuit of those running brothels &ndash; in the US and abroad &ndash; make him a\n\
    hypocrite? Possibly, though he only prosecuted operators, never \xE2\x80\x9Cjohns.\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    What about Spitzer\xE2\x80\x99s repeated use of the name of a friend and donor &ndash;\n\
    George Fox &ndash; to book the hotel room? Ai Carumba! With friends like that,\n\
    who needs enemies?</p>\n\n\
    <p>But to assertions that Spitzer\xE2\x80\x99s behaviour goes to character, I need to\n\

  content: "The facts are simple. Elliot Spitzer, who fought organised crime and\r\n\
    corruption on Wall Street, resigned last week as New York\xE2\x80\x99s Governor\r\n\
    after Federal wiretaps caught him arranging to meet an out-of-town\r\n\
    hooker in his DC hotel.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It was the Mann Act of 1910 that brought Spitzer down. In its current\r\n\
    incarnation - the US Congress amended it in 1978 and again in 1986 - the\r\n\
    statute prohibits the transportation of people across state lines for\r\n\
    the purpose of prostitution.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Out of a job, his chance at a future run at the Presidency dashed, and\r\n\
    facing 20 years jail if convicted, you have to ask: what was the man\r\n\
    thinking? I\xE2\x80\x99m not sure, though one thing he did make clear during the\r\n\
    press conferences clocking his demise was that the answer was none of\r\n\
    our business. His behaviour was a \xE2\x80\x9Cprivate matter,\xE2\x80\x9D and his \xE2\x80\x9Cfailings\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    were private, too.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I couldn\xE2\x80\x99t agree more. If Spitzer says - which he does - that he failed\r\n\
    his Harvard-trained attorney wife Silda, his children and his entire\r\n\
    family by sleeping with a prostitute, who am I to disagree? But I once\r\n\
    lived and worked in New York and if I still did, I wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t think for a\r\n\
    moment that he had failed me.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I would feel the same about an Australian politician in Spitzer\xE2\x80\x99s shoes,\r\n\
    though in New South Wales and Victoria it would be unlikely that such an\r\n\
    official would ever be charged. Indoor commercial sex was decriminalised\r\n\
    n NSW, and partially legalised in Victoria, years ago. Among the reasons\r\n\
    why is the distaste small-l liberals feel for the state sticking its\r\n\
    beak into people\xE2\x80\x99s private affairs. What two consenting adults get up to\r\n\
    in bed is no one\xE2\x80\x99s business but their own.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Those on board - or should I say in bed? - with this philosophy may feel\r\n\
    that Spitzer\xE2\x80\x99s exit from public life is a shame, given all he had given\r\n\
    to it. So he had sex with a prostitute. How exactly does this impact on\r\n\
    his ability to do his job?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Americans may be wondering about this, too. Throughout the semen stains,\r\n\
    cigar speculations and impeachment proceedings that constituted the\r\n\
    Lewinsky affair, roughly 75% told pollsters they thought Bill Clinton\r\n\
    was fit to govern, and should remain as President.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But isn\xE2\x80\x99t it wrong for those meant to uphold the law to break it?\r\n\
    Absolutely. Doesn\xE2\x80\x99t Spitzer\xE2\x80\x99s behaviour show a failure of judgment or an\r\n\
    arrogant belief that he wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t be caught? Yep. Doesn\xE2\x80\x99t his zealous\r\n\
    pursuit of those running brothels - in the US and abroad - make him a\r\n\
    hypocrite? Possibly, though he only prosecuted operators, never \xE2\x80\x9Cjohns.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    What about Spitzer\xE2\x80\x99s repeated use of the name of a friend and donor -\r\n\
    George Fox - to book the hotel room? Ai Carumba! With friends like that,\r\n\
    who needs enemies?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But to assertions that Spitzer\xE2\x80\x99s behaviour goes to character, I need to\r\n\
    ask, whose? In Australia, 19% of men have paid for sex at some point,\r\n\
    with reasons and situations varying. To my mind, it\xE2\x80\x99s those who cast\r\n\
    aspersions on all these men\xE2\x80\x99s\xE2\x80\x99 characters without knowing a thing abut\r\n\
    them or their situation - some cancer-stricken wives give their husbands\r\n\
    their blessing - who have character questions to answer.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Spitzer broke the law and for this he will rightly be made to pay. But\r\n\
    his story reminds us why laws that make commercial sex behind closed\r\n\
    doors between consenting adults a crime really need to change."

    wheelchair by a disease that causes him immense suffering. The condition\n\
    has haunted your family for generations, killing male children and\n\
    putting the female ones at risk of passing the faulty chromosome on to\n\
    their own kids.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The disease is haeomophilia, a disease of the blood that, while\n\
    treatable, causes a lifetime of pain and disability.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The good news is that, while no cure exists, there is technology that\n\
    can help. Bypassing the pleasure and privacy of sex, you can conceive\n\
    using IVF. Scientists will \xE2\x80\x9Cdiagnose\xE2\x80\x9D the sex of your embryos, discard\n\
    the affected males and implant a female. Nine months later a healthy\n\
    girl will be born.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Or not. Last week Victorian couple Fiona and Paul took action in the\n\
    Supreme Court against Melbourne IVF, Ballarat Health Services, their\n\
    obstetrician and Bendigo Radiology for failing to tell them that, in\n\
    spite of all their pre-implantation efforts, Fiona was gestating a boy.\n\
    Had they known, the couple says they would have considered termination\n\
    and their son Jesse, who came into the world with a severe form of\n\
    haemophilia, may never have been born.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The success of the couple\xE2\x80\x99s case will turn on the particulars of their\n\
    situation, but recent Australian court decisions on \xE2\x80\x9Cwrongful births\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    have favoured the parents. In 2003, the High Court upheld a lower\n\
    court\xE2\x80\x99s decision to compensate Kerry Anne and Craig Melchior for a\n\
    healthy boy, Jordan, who would not have been born but for Kerry Anne\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    doctor botching her sterilization.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The logic of the pro-compensation camp is compelling. Contraception and\n\
    pre-natal screening are designed to prevent the birth of a particular\n\
    child &ndash; one affected by disease &ndash; or any child at all. Society cannot\n\
    allow parents to avoid the birth of children they say they cannot\n\
    parent, but then deny them compensation when their prevention efforts\n\
    fail through no fault of their own.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Despite this, such cases perplex and confound. We all know that\n\
    conferring immunity on incompetent doctors is a recipe for health-care\n\
    disaster, yet feel sick at the thought of a child discovering later in\n\
    life &ndash; perhaps in excruciating detail &ndash; how much his parents wished he\xE2\x80\x99d\n\
    not been born.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But what we need to keep in mind is that the way parents like Fiona and\n\
    Paul feel about a child they haven\xE2\x80\x99t yet conceived, or a very early\n\
    embryo in vivo or vitro, is very different to the emotions provoked by a\n\
    newborn lying in their arms. Indeed, it is this difference that leads\n\
    them to try and avoid a very sick child being born in the first place.\n\
    Because they know that once that child arrives, sick or not, they will\n\
    love him, and suffer with him. Indeed, it is to avoid this &ndash; the loving\n\
    of a sick and suffering child &ndash; that they sought in good faith to avoid,\n\
    and for this child that they sue, not for themselves. Because while\n\
    money is good for hospital bills and respite care, it won\xE2\x80\x99t touch the\n\
    guilt and heartache born every day by the parents of a chronically sick\n\
    kid.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Understanding this ends the mystery of why nearly all pregnant women who\n\

    engineering-or global climate control-may soon be a fact of life.</p>\n\n\
    <p>First, the good news. You know how the Stern Report said we\xE2\x80\x99ve only got\n\
    eight to eighteen years left to significantly reduce global emissions or\n\
    risk costly and irreversible damage to the planet? And how, despite\n\
    this, global leaders continue to do bugger-all to fix the problem? To do\n\
    so little, in fact, that most of us have concluded that either they are\n\
    booked on a well-furnished galactic space station that the rest of us\n\
    don\xE2\x80\x99t know about or, even more depressingly, that what is collectively\n\
    required of us to save the planet is beyond our capacity to achieve?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Well, turns out that despite this tragic state of affairs, we-or our\n\
    children or grandchildren-may not have to die. Because there is a Plan\n\
    C.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Plan B requires governments to develop and commercialise carbon-neutral\n\

  content: "You may not have heard of it, but my guess is, you will soon. Climate\r\n\
    engineering-or global climate control-may soon be a fact of life.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    First, the good news. You know how the Stern Report said we\xE2\x80\x99ve only got\r\n\
    eight to eighteen years left to significantly reduce global emissions or\r\n\
    risk costly and irreversible damage to the planet? And how, despite\r\n\
    this, global leaders continue to do bugger-all to fix the problem? To do\r\n\
    so little, in fact, that most of us have concluded that either they are\r\n\
    booked on a well-furnished galactic space station that the rest of us\r\n\
    don\xE2\x80\x99t know about or, even more depressingly, that what is collectively\r\n\
    required of us to save the planet is beyond our capacity to achieve?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Well, turns out that despite this tragic state of affairs, we-or our\r\n\
    children or grandchildren-may not have to die. Because there is a Plan\r\n\
    C.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Plan B requires governments to develop and commercialise carbon-neutral\r\n\
    energy and energy conservation technologies. A good idea but, like Plan\r\n\
    A, still awaiting action on the policy front.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Enter Plan C: climate engineering. Whether it\xE2\x80\x99s chucking\r\n\

    \r\n\
    Because they thought they shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In an extraordinary and perhaps unprecedented act of self-censorship,\r\n\
    they seem to have kept mum-shelving papers, shunning mavericks~~-\r\n\
    because they believed that if political leaders knew there was a\r\n\

  content_markup: "<p>Madonna turns 50 this year. Like every wheeze and fart in the\n\
    entertainer\xE2\x80\x99s life, this one is attracting comment. From some, it sounds\n\
    like this. \xE2\x80\x9C50? She looks 30! If she really was a taboo-breaker, she\n\
    wouldn\xE2\x80\x99t have smooth skin and pert breasts. She\xE2\x80\x99d be strutting her stuff\n\
    on the cover of Vanity Fair with a wrinkled d&eacute;colletage and baggy\n\
    arms hanging out.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Like most discussions about ageing in contemporary Australia, this one\n\
    is confused. On the one hand, baby-boomers can\xE2\x80\x99t stop telling us that 60\n\
    is the new 50, that age-related discrimination is rife, and that no one\n\
    should have to give up what they do or love because others say they\xE2\x80\x99re\n\
    too old. Stay at work! Keep enjoying sex! Arise and go windsailing!\n\
    Having only just arrived in middle age I can tell you that exhortations\n\
    to keep on keeping on are constant.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But don\xE2\x80\x99t attempt to match your youthful activities with youthful looks,\n\
    or you will be condemned as unenlightened and vain. So what if employers\n\
    discriminate against older workers or that invisibility for women beyond\n\
    a certain age is inevitable? Resistance by Botox or surgery is wrong,\n\
    wrong, wrong. The upshot? We\xE2\x80\x99re forbidden to act our age but required to\n\
    look it. Where\xE2\x80\x99s the sense in that?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Which takes us back to the material girl. Yes, it would it have been\n\
    radical for the bare arms emerging from Madonna\xE2\x80\x99s body suit to have been\n\
    dotted with hair-sprouting moles. Radical for cascading waves of\n\
    cellulite to have been visible above her thigh-high black boots.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But does anyone really think this would have made middle age \xE2\x80\x9Chot\xE2\x80\x9D? My\n\
    guess is that such an appearance would have started a whisper campaign\n\
    that would have brought Madonna\xE2\x80\x99s long-running reign as a cultural icon\n\
    to a close. Poor Madonna, look at how old she looks. Poor Madonna, she\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    let herself go. Poor Madonna, can\xE2\x80\x99t she see she\xE2\x80\x99s not beautiful any\n\
    more, and so no longer entitled to the power beautiful women wield?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Pitying Madonna. It gives me shivers to think about it.</p>\n\n\
    <p>No wonder she has refused to age gracefully. No wonder she resists not\n\
    just in ways we approve (eating well, spending hours in the gym and at\n\
    dance rehearsals) but in ways we don\xE2\x80\x99t (liquid and surgical lifts,\n\
    tucks, peels and slathers). Resists received opinion about right and\n\
    wrong, and the endless rules about how women should live their lives,\n\
    just as she has always done.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So why are we so quick to judge? Madonna is reticent about her fitness\n\
    and other age-retarding routines. She never promotes them as liberatory\n\
    or feminist in any sense.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I think it\xE2\x80\x99s envy and a desperate sense that we can\xE2\x80\x99t keep up. Madonna\n\
    at 50 looks better than most of us at 30, and this makes some of us feel\n\
    like failures. We could console ourselves with the fact she has a home\n\
    gym, a personal trainer, nannies and a travelling chef to support her\n\
    efforts, but instead we point the finger, and accuse her of letting us\n\
    down.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I don\xE2\x80\x99t think she has and suspect that Nora Ephron would agree. Ephron,\n\
    of When Harry met Sally fame, had this to say about ageing in a recent\n\
    essay in American Vogue: \xE2\x80\x9C[Some people say] it\xE2\x80\x99s great to be old. It\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    great to be wise and sage and mellow; it\xE2\x80\x99s great to be at the point\n\
    where you understand just what matters in life. I can\xE2\x80\x99t stand people who\n\
    say things like this.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n"

    guess is that such an appearance would have started a whisper campaign\r\n\
    that would have brought Madonna\xE2\x80\x99s long-running reign as a cultural icon\r\n\
    to a close. Poor Madonna, look at how old she looks. Poor Madonna, she\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    let herself go. Poor Madonna, can\xE2\x80\x99t she see she\xE2\x80\x99s not beautiful any\r\n\
    more, and so no longer entitled to the power beautiful women wield?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Pitying Madonna. It gives me shivers to think about it.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    No wonder she has refused to age gracefully. No wonder she resists not\r\n\
    just in ways we approve (eating well, spending hours in the gym and at\r\n\
    dance rehearsals) but in ways we don\xE2\x80\x99t (liquid and surgical lifts,\r\n\
    tucks, peels and slathers). Resists received opinion about right and\r\n\
    wrong, and the endless rules about how women should live their lives,\r\n\
    just as she has always done.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So why are we so quick to judge? Madonna is reticent about her fitness\r\n\
    and other age-retarding routines. She never promotes them as liberatory\r\n\
    or feminist in any sense.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I think it\xE2\x80\x99s envy and a desperate sense that we can\xE2\x80\x99t keep up. Madonna\r\n\
    at 50 looks better than most of us at 30, and this makes some of us feel\r\n\
    like failures. We could console ourselves with the fact she has a home\r\n\
    gym, a personal trainer, nannies and a travelling chef to support her\r\n\
    efforts, but instead we point the finger, and accuse her of letting us\r\n\
    down.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I don\xE2\x80\x99t think she has and suspect that Nora Ephron would agree. Ephron,\r\n\
    of When Harry met Sally fame, had this to say about ageing in a recent\r\n\
    essay in American Vogue: \xE2\x80\x9C[Some people say] it\xE2\x80\x99s great to be old. It\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    great to be wise and sage and mellow; it\xE2\x80\x99s great to be at the point\r\n\
    where you understand just what matters in life. I can\xE2\x80\x99t stand people who\r\n\
    say things like this.\xE2\x80\x9D"

    <p>At a meeting I attended, the capacity of women to make ethically\n\
    defensible choices about using pre-natal screening tests was openly\n\

    <p>Doubts about women\xE2\x80\x99s moral agency date back to the Greeks. Plato argued\n\
    that \xE2\x80\x9Cwomen\xE2\x80\x99s nature is inferior to that of men in capacity for virtue\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    and so more inclined to \xE2\x80\x9Csecrecy and stealth.\xE2\x80\x9D More than 2000 years\n\
    later, Freud argued that women\xE2\x80\x99s psychosexual development meant that\n\
    women \xE2\x80\x9Cshow less sense of justice than men.\xE2\x80\x9D In the late 1950s, a\n\
    soon-to-be influential moral psychologist named Lawrence Kohlberg\n\
    developed a six stage model of moral development that suggested it was\n\
    no accident that the Gandi\xE2\x80\x99s and Martin Luther King\xE2\x80\x99s of the world were\n\
    men. Women, because of an overemphasis on maintaining relationships,\n\

    around. A recent study of the giving habits of Americans found that\n\

    has dedicated his life to building schools for girls in impoverished\n\

  title: Why Parental Leave is a Moral Issue
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 17:58:36
  content_markup: "<p>The government has ordered yet another inquiry into a paid leave scheme\n\
    for working Australian parents. This one, by the Productivity\n\
    Commission, follows two similar ones by HREOC and a Senate Committee in\n\
    2002. What is left to examine, for heaven\xE2\x80\x99s sake! It\xE2\x80\x99s a leave scheme,\n\
    not the first signs of life on Mars.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But PM Rudd may be more likely than his predecessors to stop yakking\n\
    about parental leave, and actually do the deed. When he does, the most\n\
    important decision he\xE2\x80\x99ll make is who will be granted leave.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Let\xE2\x80\x99s pray it won\xE2\x80\x99t just be mothers. Because dads need leave, too.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The best idea is the allocation of 18 months of paid leave for parents\n\
    to use as they please over the first five years of the child\xE2\x80\x99s life,\n\
    with one condition. Five months must either be taken by Dads, or\n\
    sacrificed (a provision the Nordic countries have used successfully to\n\
    help men resist being bullied out of time with their infant by a macho,\n\
    all-hours work culture).</p>\n\n\
    <p>But those in favour of parental leave may need to fight to be heard.\n\
    Politicians, commentators and even feminists have been talking about\n\
    maternity leave for so long that the placement of the word \xE2\x80\x9Cfather\xE2\x80\x9D next\n\
    to \xE2\x80\x9Cinfant\xE2\x80\x9D has developed radical connotations. Said the Government of\n\
    the latest inquiry: \xE2\x80\x9CWe want to explore ways to make it as easy as\n\
    possible for working mums to balance their employment with the important\n\
    job of raising a new generation of Australians.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>In part, the reactionary gloss on debates about paid leave-a policy that\n\
    has long been central to the progressive goal of achieving equality\n\
    between the sexes-is a legacy of the Howard years.</p>\n\n\
    <p>We all know what John Howard thought about working mothers (those who\n\
    were married, anyway. The single ones he condemned as dole-bludgers). In\n\
    a desperate attempt to swing the PM their way, feminists inside and\n\
    outside the Liberal party tried to make a national leave scheme a small\n\
    target by arguing that women needed it to be good women: so they could\n\
    breastfeed longer, bond better with their babies and keep their young\n\
    from the devil\xE2\x80\x99s playground called childcare. Said then Sex\n\
    Discrimination Commissioner Pru Goward, \xE2\x80\x9CIt is very unusual to find\n\
    women in Europe\xE2\x80\xA6going back to work with children under the age of 6\n\
    months as you increasingly find in Australia, with all the implications\n\
    that has with breast-feeding, for the recovery of the mother and for the\n\

  content: "The government has ordered yet another inquiry into a paid leave scheme\r\n\
    for working Australian parents. This one, by the Productivity\r\n\
    Commission, follows two similar ones by HREOC and a Senate Committee in\r\n\
    2002. What is left to examine, for heaven\xE2\x80\x99s sake! It\xE2\x80\x99s a leave scheme,\r\n\
    not the first signs of life on Mars.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But PM Rudd may be more likely than his predecessors to stop yakking\r\n\
    about parental leave, and actually do the deed. When he does, the most\r\n\
    important decision he\xE2\x80\x99ll make is who will be granted leave.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Let\xE2\x80\x99s pray it won\xE2\x80\x99t just be mothers. Because dads need leave, too.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The best idea is the allocation of 18 months of paid leave for parents\r\n\
    to use as they please over the first five years of the child\xE2\x80\x99s life,\r\n\
    with one condition. Five months must either be taken by Dads, or\r\n\
    sacrificed (a provision the Nordic countries have used successfully to\r\n\
    help men resist being bullied out of time with their infant by a macho,\r\n\
    all-hours work culture).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But those in favour of parental leave may need to fight to be heard.\r\n\
    Politicians, commentators and even feminists have been talking about\r\n\
    maternity leave for so long that the placement of the word \xE2\x80\x9Cfather\xE2\x80\x9D next\r\n\
    to \xE2\x80\x9Cinfant\xE2\x80\x9D has developed radical connotations. Said the Government of\r\n\
    the latest inquiry: \xE2\x80\x9CWe want to explore ways to make it as easy as\r\n\
    possible for working mums to balance their employment with the important\r\n\
    job of raising a new generation of Australians.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In part, the reactionary gloss on debates about paid leave-a policy that\r\n\
    has long been central to the progressive goal of achieving equality\r\n\
    between the sexes-is a legacy of the Howard years.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    We all know what John Howard thought about working mothers (those who\r\n\
    were married, anyway. The single ones he condemned as dole-bludgers). In\r\n\
    a desperate attempt to swing the PM their way, feminists inside and\r\n\
    outside the Liberal party tried to make a national leave scheme a small\r\n\
    target by arguing that women needed it to be good women: so they could\r\n\
    breastfeed longer, bond better with their babies and keep their young\r\n\
    from the devil\xE2\x80\x99s playground called childcare. Said then Sex\r\n\
    Discrimination Commissioner Pru Goward, \xE2\x80\x9CIt is very unusual to find\r\n\
    women in Europe\xE2\x80\xA6going back to work with children under the age of 6\r\n\
    months as you increasingly find in Australia, with all the implications\r\n\
    that has with breast-feeding, for the recovery of the mother and for the\r\n\
    development of the child\xE2\x80\xA6[it is] a scandal that so many babies are being\r\n\
    left in care\xE2\x80\xA6\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It didn\xE2\x80\x99t work. Worse, it left us with an antediluvian way of talking\r\n\
    about the kind of leave we want, and why we want it that threatens our\r\n\
    capacity to win something worth having.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    We need to start fresh. From the premise that both Australian men and\r\n\
    women do work, want to work or need to work and that when they partner,\r\n\
    most want to have kids. This makes the central policy question: how can\r\n\
    we help them do both?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Such a gender-neutral frame presumes what most of us know to be true.\r\n\
    That parents have a responsibility to share the work and pleasure of\r\n\
    caring and earning. That they need to give their kids the benefits of\r\n\
    being cared for by both parents and model for their children the\r\n\
    capacity of both genders to move with ease and independence between home\r\n\
    and the wider world.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Parental, not maternity, leave is the only moral policy choice."

    <p>As an ethicist, I am asked this question more than any other. Perhaps\n\

    <p>I have sympathy for those who claim some actions, and the people who\n\

    the desert on the pretence of meeting Santa Claus and catching snakes so\n\

    the crown, of course, are Australians John Bunting and Robert Wagner\n\

    <p>The process of setting moral standards is a collective one. When a\n\
    member of our community becomes a victim of a moral crime, it is our\n\
    reaction to the event-the words of our leaders, talk-back radio calls,\n\
    chat around the water-cooler-that either affirms or modifies the\n\
    existing consensus on what Is acceptable behaviour. Whether it\xE2\x80\x99s a child\n\
    raped by the trusted parish Priest, a wife betrayed by a sexual liaison\n\
    between her husband and best friend, or the frail old codger defrauded\n\
    by the down-and-out youth he sought to assist, condemning such acts as\n\
    unforgivable contributes to the collective process of defining who we\n\
    are by what we believe is right and wrong. It is from such definitions,\n\
    and the process we undertake to arrive at them, that our children learn\n\
    our moral code.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But while unforgiveability may be a useful tool for preventing heinous\n\

    <p>We are talking about the sort of hate that gives rise to claim that\n\

    this sort of attack on social outcasts of Jesus\xE2\x80\x99s time by the powerful\n\
    men of the day-the Temple Priests-that inspired Jesus\xE2\x80\x99s mission and the\n\

    and minority groups from society that saw Jesus enter the Temple to\n\

    included in the circle of God\xE2\x80\x99s concern.</p>\n\n\

    tell, even the lunar religious right in America admits that Jesus never\n\

    <p>But even if the Bible did advise us to shun homosexuals or stone them\n\
    (as it suggests for adulterers), we don\xE2\x80\x99t have to listen. After all, we\n\
    ignore its command to wed our virginal daughters to their rapists, and\n\
    refuse its permission to purchases the children of foreigners to serve\n\
    us as slaves.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The point is that even those who claim absolute obedience to scripture\n\

    that there is much in the Bible that is irrelevant, outdated or just\n\
    plain barbaric.</p>\n\n\

    superiors of any sort doesn\xE2\x80\x99t relieve an individual of responsibility if\n\
    a moral choice is possible.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Powerful Christian leaders have a choice. They don\xE2\x80\x99t have to vilify and\n\
    discriminate against gay people, they choose to, and for this they can &ndash;\n\

    <p>When Howard fell, taking with him his incendiary choice of Health\n\
    Minister Tony Abbott &ndash; a.k.a. the `mad monk\xE2\x80\x99 &ndash; many sighed with relief.\n\
    Surely the Ministerial appointments of Julia Gillard and Nicola Roxon,\n\
    and the elevation of former AMA President Brendan Nelson to Opposition\n\
    leader signalled the demise of womb-watching as a national sport, and\n\
    the re-assertion of the commonsense belief that women and their partners\n\
    have the right to decide if and when they bear children.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But the view that the new Federal landscape represents a new dawn in\n\
    fertility politics is about to be tested. On 18 June, Tasmanian Liberal\n\
    Senator Guy Barnett gave notice of plans to table a motion in parliament\n\
    that would make women more than 14 weeks pregnant undergoing labour for\n\
    an \xE2\x80\x9Cintrauterine fetal death, gross fetal abnormality or life\n\
    threatening maternal disease\xE2\x80\x9D pay for the procedure themselves. Medicare\n\
    funding, just for these women undertaking just this procedure, would no\n\
    longer be available.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So what if a woman has a dead fetus festering in her womb, or one\n\
    affected by what Barnett himself describes as a \xE2\x80\x9Ccommon disabilities\n\
    such as Down syndrome and spina bifida.\xE2\x80\x9D Who cares if her condition puts\n\
    her life at risk? Where do such women get off thinking they not only\n\
    have a right to such medical care, but to have Medicare fund it? If Guy\n\
    Barnett, a self-described man of \xE2\x80\x9Cconscience,\xE2\x80\x9D has his way, such feral\n\
    feminists will be coming down off that high horse, and quick.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The issue will come to a vote in September. Whether, and how strenuously\n\
    his Liberal and Labor colleagues will say much about the future of\n\
    womb-watching in this country.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Will Brendan Nelson maintain his long-held view that exiting Medicare\n\
    arrangements must stay in place to avoid backyard abortion, or will he\n\
    squib &ndash; as he did earlier this month when it came to lifting the ban on\n\
    foreign aid paying for abortion &ndash; in a fruitless attempt to please the\n\
    party\xE2\x80\x99s right wing? Will Deputy PM Gillard and Health Minister Nicola\n\
    Roxon, two women whose hearts are clearly in the right place on this\n\
    issue stand up and be counted &ndash; both behind the scenes and in front of\n\
    the cameras &ndash; or will their ambition get in the way?</p>\n\n\
    <p>I\xE2\x80\x99ve heard that when Barnett declared his intentions in the party room,\n\
    most of his colleagues rolled their eyes. Not just because most\n\
    Liberals-like most members of the ALP and 81% of Australians-support the\n\
    right of individuals to decide, but because they are sick to death of\n\
    discussing abortion.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Guy Barnett, if you don\xE2\x80\x99t want to have an abortion, it\xE2\x80\x99s OK. You don\xE2\x80\x99t\n\
    have to have one. Now, can you get out of the conversational way so the\n\
    rest of the nation can discuss the issues that really matter.</p>\n"

    \r\n\
    So what if a woman has a dead fetus festering in her womb, or one\r\n\
    affected by what Barnett himself describes as a \xE2\x80\x9Ccommon disabilities\r\n\
    such as Down syndrome and spina bifida.\xE2\x80\x9D Who cares if her condition puts\r\n\
    her life at risk? Where do such women get off thinking they not only\r\n\
    have a right to such medical care, but to have Medicare fund it? If Guy\r\n\
    Barnett, a self-described man of \xE2\x80\x9Cconscience,\xE2\x80\x9D has his way, such feral\r\n\
    feminists will be coming down off that high horse, and quick.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The issue will come to a vote in September. Whether, and how strenuously\r\n\
    his Liberal and Labor colleagues will say much about the future of\r\n\
    womb-watching in this country.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Will Brendan Nelson maintain his long-held view that exiting Medicare\r\n\
    arrangements must stay in place to avoid backyard abortion, or will he\r\n\
    squib - as he did earlier this month when it came to lifting the ban on\r\n\
    foreign aid paying for abortion - in a fruitless attempt to please the\r\n\
    party\xE2\x80\x99s right wing? Will Deputy PM Gillard and Health Minister Nicola\r\n\
    Roxon, two women whose hearts are clearly in the right place on this\r\n\
    issue stand up and be counted - both behind the scenes and in front of\r\n\
    the cameras - or will their ambition get in the way?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I\xE2\x80\x99ve heard that when Barnett declared his intentions in the party room,\r\n\
    most of his colleagues rolled their eyes. Not just because most\r\n\
    Liberals-like most members of the ALP and 81% of Australians-support the\r\n\
    right of individuals to decide, but because they are sick to death of\r\n\
    discussing abortion.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Guy Barnett, if you don\xE2\x80\x99t want to have an abortion, it\xE2\x80\x99s OK. You don\xE2\x80\x99t\r\n\
    have to have one. Now, can you get out of the conversational way so the\r\n\
    rest of the nation can discuss the issues that really matter."

  title: Teaching our Kids the Difference Between Science and Faith
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 18:01:30
  content_markup: "<p>Moral Maze: Teaching our Kids the Difference Between Science and Faith</p>\n\n\
    <p>Defeating the religious right\xE2\x80\x99s latest attack on reason and evidence\n\
    requires beating them at their own game.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The current site of the controversy is the US, where Louisiana has\n\
    passed a law requiring the education bureaucracy to assist schools that\n\
    wish to help students \xE2\x80\x9Cunderstand, analyze, critique, and review\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    scientific theories like evolution, the origins of life, global warming,\n\
    and human cloning.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Intelligent design, or its forerunner creation science, in sheep\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    clothing? You betcha. But dressed up as academic freedom, the new law is\n\
    predicted to succeed in introducing biblical principles into the\n\
    classroom where those in more blatant contravention of the US separation\n\
    of Church and State have failed.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I\xE2\x80\x99m on their side, but I reckon the opponents of this bill, and the many\n\
    predicted to follow it into legislatures across the country, need to\n\
    modify their language and tactics if they want to beat their wealthy,\n\
    dedicated and relentless opponent: the fundamentalist Christian\n\
    churches.</p>\n\n\
    <p>First and foremost, they need to get past their moral indignation at the\n\
    slick and cynical use by bible-bashers of the language and values of the\n\
    progressive left. To do this, they need to stop arguing against the\n\
    legislation on the grounds that Darwinian evolution is \xE2\x80\x9Caccepted\n\
    scientific fact,\xE2\x80\x9D and get on with turning the stated goals of the new\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cacademic freedom\xE2\x80\x9D legislation to their advantage.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Because at the heart of this debate is not evolution, or any other\n\
    answer to key questions that the scientific method turns up at a point\n\
    in history, but the workings of the method itself. Currently, primary\n\
    and secondary school children are taught scientific content: the\n\
    conclusions of scientific investigation into questions like \xE2\x80\x9Chow did\n\
    life on earth begin?\xE2\x80\x9D Only when students enter university, are the\n\
    methods used to reach such conclusions properly explained and used to\n\
    critique contemporary answers to key questions.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This is ass-around backwards. As business leaders have been telling us\n\
    for years, what we need in our rapid-fire world, where knowledge dates\n\
    faster than it takes to chew a piece of gum, is people who know how to\n\
    assess the value of new information and\xE2\x80\x94where it is deemed valid and\n\
    valuable\xE2\x80\x94to acquire it. People, in other words, who don\xE2\x80\x99t know stuff,\n\
    but know how to think.</p>\n\n\
    <p>No matter how widely accepted it is today, no theory\xE2\x80\x94including\n\
    evolution\xE2\x80\x94is beyond question. The accumulation of enough\n\
    counter-evidence, or the successful questioning of the method or logic\n\

  content: "Moral Maze: Teaching our Kids the Difference Between Science and Faith\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Defeating the religious right\xE2\x80\x99s latest attack on reason and evidence\r\n\
    requires beating them at their own game.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The current site of the controversy is the US, where Louisiana has\r\n\
    passed a law requiring the education bureaucracy to assist schools that\r\n\
    wish to help students \xE2\x80\x9Cunderstand, analyze, critique, and review\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    scientific theories like evolution, the origins of life, global warming,\r\n\
    and human cloning.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Intelligent design, or its forerunner creation science, in sheep\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    clothing? You betcha. But dressed up as academic freedom, the new law is\r\n\
    predicted to succeed in introducing biblical principles into the\r\n\
    classroom where those in more blatant contravention of the US separation\r\n\
    of Church and State have failed.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I\xE2\x80\x99m on their side, but I reckon the opponents of this bill, and the many\r\n\
    predicted to follow it into legislatures across the country, need to\r\n\
    modify their language and tactics if they want to beat their wealthy,\r\n\
    dedicated and relentless opponent: the fundamentalist Christian\r\n\
    churches.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    First and foremost, they need to get past their moral indignation at the\r\n\
    slick and cynical use by bible-bashers of the language and values of the\r\n\
    progressive left. To do this, they need to stop arguing against the\r\n\
    legislation on the grounds that Darwinian evolution is \xE2\x80\x9Caccepted\r\n\
    scientific fact,\xE2\x80\x9D and get on with turning the stated goals of the new\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cacademic freedom\xE2\x80\x9D legislation to their advantage.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Because at the heart of this debate is not evolution, or any other\r\n\
    answer to key questions that the scientific method turns up at a point\r\n\
    in history, but the workings of the method itself. Currently, primary\r\n\
    and secondary school children are taught scientific content: the\r\n\
    conclusions of scientific investigation into questions like \xE2\x80\x9Chow did\r\n\
    life on earth begin?\xE2\x80\x9D Only when students enter university, are the\r\n\
    methods used to reach such conclusions properly explained and used to\r\n\
    critique contemporary answers to key questions.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This is ass-around backwards. As business leaders have been telling us\r\n\
    for years, what we need in our rapid-fire world, where knowledge dates\r\n\
    faster than it takes to chew a piece of gum, is people who know how to\r\n\
    assess the value of new information and\xE2\x80\x94where it is deemed valid and\r\n\
    valuable\xE2\x80\x94to acquire it. People, in other words, who don\xE2\x80\x99t know stuff,\r\n\
    but know how to think.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    No matter how widely accepted it is today, no theory\xE2\x80\x94including\r\n\
    evolution\xE2\x80\x94is beyond question. The accumulation of enough\r\n\
    counter-evidence, or the successful questioning of the method or logic\r\n\
    used to develop the theory in the first place, will topple it in the\r\n\
    sort of paradigm shift that makes academic careers and defines human\r\n\
    progress. This is how reason and evidence-based systems, of which\r\n\
    science is one, work.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Only by accepting this, and by turning the ruthless objectivity of\r\n\
    reason and evidence-based systems to their advantage, can those seeking\r\n\
    to defend modern ways of knowing against pre-enlightenment ones based on\r\n\
    faith, tradition or plain superstition, prevail.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Perhaps the latest manifestation of creationism, and the threat it poses\r\n\
    to post-enlightenment ways of doing business, could prompt educators to\r\n\
    listen. To stop stuffing our primary and secondary school children with\r\n\
    reams of content certain to date, and to teach them instead to consider\r\n\
    the validity of the varying methods humans have tried over time to\r\n\
    decide what is right and true.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    If they know this we won\xE2\x80\x99t have to tell them that creationism, or\r\n\
    whatever theory the faith-based crowd decide to throw at us next year,\r\n\
    is something we can choose to believe it, but not something we can know.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    They will be able to work this out for themselves."

    <p>Many would see the Lucy ads as a call for more Australians to become\n\
    vegetarian or vegan. This would not be a bad thing. Vegetarians walk the\n\
    walk. Whether frowning at menus short of meat-free options or\n\
    unapologetically arriving at cocktail parties in tennis shoes, they put\n\

    <p>Personally, I\xE2\x80\x99ve been on both sides of the meat-eating divide. A\n\
    vegetarian during my late teens and twenties on ethical grounds, I began\n\
    eating meat again when, pregnant for the first time, my dreams became\n\

    <p>Most people don\xE2\x80\x99t know it, but the central claim in Professor Peter\n\

    suffer, they are owed moral consideration. The sort of moral\n\
    consideration that requires we humans to eliminate any unnecessary\n\

  title: Men, Abortion and the Sin of Moral Arrogance

  content_markup: "<p>Abortion is back in the news, with a bill now before the Victorian\n\
    parliament that, if it becomes law, will give women with problem\n\
    pregnancies of less than twenty-four weeks the right to decide for\n\
    themselves.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Whenever abortion is at issue, questions about the place of men in the\n\
    debate looms large and unspoken. What role do men play in political and\n\
    personal discussions about termination, and what role &ndash; morally speaking\n\
    &ndash; should they play?</p>\n\n\
    <p>The facts are simple. Men dominate the politics of abortion in the same\n\
    way they do all other issues. One figure puts the percentage of\n\
    anti-choice leaders who are men at 77%. This is in addition to the\n\
    significant influence male religious leaders like the Pope (through the\n\
    Vatican\xE2\x80\x99s full membership of the United Nations) have on reproductive\n\
    health policy across the globe.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Even on the pro-choice side, where most leadership roles are held by\n\
    women, men have been critical to the success of campaigns that give\n\
    women the right to decide. MP Wayne Berry was the architect of the 2002\n\
    legislation in the ACT that treats abortion like any other medical\n\
    procedure. Henry Morgentaler was key to achieving a similarly\n\
    progressive law in Canada in 1988.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Problem pregnancies require decisions that touch on our most intimate\n\
    experiences and values concerning sex, fertility, love and\n\
    relationships. Here again, men feature large. Research shows that while\n\
    the vast majority of women faced with an unplanned pregnancy don\xE2\x80\x99t want\n\
    counselling, they do want information from the biological father.\n\
    Indeed, he is the person they are most likely to consult as they\n\
    consider their choice. Does he want a child, now or ever? What role will\n\
    he play in raising it? What support might he provide if she decides to\n\
    go it alone? The presence of a man willing to engage in such\n\
    discussions, and the answers he gives, will critically affect the\n\
    woman\xE2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So men do play a critical role in abortion politics and abortion\n\
    decisions. The question is, should they?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Men\xE2\x80\x99s role in the decisions individual women make about problem\n\
    pregnancies is a simple fact of life to which no \xE2\x80\x9Cought\xE2\x80\x9D can or should\n\
    be applied.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But before you can determine the proper role of men in the political\n\
    debate, you must recognise the fact that-at the end of the day-a\n\
    decision about continuing or terminating a pregnancy is not open to\n\
    compromise. You can\xE2\x80\x99t have half a baby or half an abortion. While women\n\
    in functioning, non-violent relationships do tend to consult the\n\
    biological father, ultimately one person\xE2\x80\x99s view must prevail. The law\n\
    privileges the woman\xE2\x80\x99s decision because the bodily experience of\n\
    pregnancy and birth invest her more heavily in the outcome.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It is also her call because, short of making a pregnant woman the\n\
    biological father\xE2\x80\x99s slave, there would be no way to enforce his right to\n\
    decide other than giving him the power to wrestle her on to the surgical\n\
    table (if she wants to continue and he wants to terminate) or snapping a\n\
    collar on her and handing him the lead (if she wants to terminate and he\n\
    wants to continue).</p>\n\n\
    <p>Does men\xE2\x80\x99s disconnect from the risk and experience of pregnancy and\n\

    <p>Imagine a woman-led and dominated group that sought to deny men access\n\

    vasectomies reduce the number of babies being born that infertile\n\
    couples would be more than happy to raise.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Do we think such a group is legitimate? That its views should hold sway\n\

  title: Heavy Cross to Bear for Gay Donors
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 18:01:07
  content_markup: "<p>Political activism is often a thankless task. It\xE2\x80\x99s worse when the cause\n\
    is not just controversial, but shrouded in stigma and shame. Yes, a lot\n\
    of hard work goes into raising cash for breast cancer research or to\n\
    send disabled athletes to Beijing, but at least it\xE2\x80\x99s easy to ask your\n\
    colleagues and friends to donate, and to get VIPs to sign on as patrons\n\
    to the cause.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Michael Cain is a 26 year-old gay man living in Tasmania who has stuck\n\
    his head above the parapet to make a stand on an issue of equity and\n\
    justice. But the battle Cain\xE2\x80\x99s picked is one that not only opens him to\n\
    scorn and aggression because it reveals his sexual orientation, but of\n\
    accusations that he is putting his own interests ahead of the public\n\
    good.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In 2005, the Australian Red Cross Blood Service refused Michael Cain\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    offer to donate blood because he has sex with men. Cain thinks the\n\
    grounds for this refusal amount to unjust discrimination, and he has\n\
    taken his case to the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Tribunal. The\n\
    question he wants the Red Cross to answer is simple. Why, given that he\n\
    practises safe sex, won\xE2\x80\x99t they let him donate, when the Red Cross leaves\n\
    the welcome light on for donors who are sexually promiscuous and never\n\
    come within coo-ee of a condom, as long as they are straight.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It doesn\xE2\x80\x99t make sense. Australia is widely acknowledged as having one of\n\
    the most intelligent and effective public health strategies to combat\n\
    the spread of the virus in the world. At the core of our policies is a\n\
    consistent and clear message about safe sex.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The risk of transmission of HIV/AIDS through the blood supply is\n\
    negligible, thanks to tests able to determine whether the virus is\n\
    present. To guard against the teeny, tiny risk that human error could\n\
    see infected blood mistakenly released into the blood supply, the Red\n\
    Cross tries to stop donors at risk of HIV/AIDS from holding out their\n\
    arm in the first place.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Well and good, but the question is: who is at risk of catching HIV/AIDS?</p>\n\n\
    <p>What public health experts have been telling us since the 1980s is that\n\
    those who have unsafe sex are at risk. What Cain wants the Red Cross to\n\
    do is screen out only those donors who practice unsafe sex, regardless\n\
    of the gender of their sexual partners.</p>\n\n\

  content: "Political activism is often a thankless task. It\xE2\x80\x99s worse when the cause\r\n\
    is not just controversial, but shrouded in stigma and shame. Yes, a lot\r\n\
    of hard work goes into raising cash for breast cancer research or to\r\n\
    send disabled athletes to Beijing, but at least it\xE2\x80\x99s easy to ask your\r\n\
    colleagues and friends to donate, and to get VIPs to sign on as patrons\r\n\
    to the cause.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Michael Cain is a 26 year-old gay man living in Tasmania who has stuck\r\n\
    his head above the parapet to make a stand on an issue of equity and\r\n\
    justice. But the battle Cain\xE2\x80\x99s picked is one that not only opens him to\r\n\
    scorn and aggression because it reveals his sexual orientation, but of\r\n\
    accusations that he is putting his own interests ahead of the public\r\n\
    good.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Nothing could be further from the truth.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In 2005, the Australian Red Cross Blood Service refused Michael Cain\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    offer to donate blood because he has sex with men. Cain thinks the\r\n\
    grounds for this refusal amount to unjust discrimination, and he has\r\n\
    taken his case to the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Tribunal. The\r\n\
    question he wants the Red Cross to answer is simple. Why, given that he\r\n\
    practises safe sex, won\xE2\x80\x99t they let him donate, when the Red Cross leaves\r\n\
    the welcome light on for donors who are sexually promiscuous and never\r\n\
    come within coo-ee of a condom, as long as they are straight.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It doesn\xE2\x80\x99t make sense. Australia is widely acknowledged as having one of\r\n\
    the most intelligent and effective public health strategies to combat\r\n\
    the spread of the virus in the world. At the core of our policies is a\r\n\
    consistent and clear message about safe sex.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The risk of transmission of HIV/AIDS through the blood supply is\r\n\
    negligible, thanks to tests able to determine whether the virus is\r\n\
    present. To guard against the teeny, tiny risk that human error could\r\n\
    see infected blood mistakenly released into the blood supply, the Red\r\n\
    Cross tries to stop donors at risk of HIV/AIDS from holding out their\r\n\
    arm in the first place.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Well and good, but the question is: who is at risk of catching HIV/AIDS?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    What public health experts have been telling us since the 1980s is that\r\n\
    those who have unsafe sex are at risk. What Cain wants the Red Cross to\r\n\
    do is screen out only those donors who practice unsafe sex, regardless\r\n\
    of the gender of their sexual partners.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In a happy coincidence, screening policies based on the riskiness of\r\n\
    sexual activity are both discrimination-free and effective. When Italy\r\n\
    switched from a screening policy based on the gender of the sexual\r\n\
    partner to one focused on risky behaviours, their transmission rates of\r\n\
    HIV through blood donation fell.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Using figures provided by one of the Red Cross\xE2\x80\x99s own witnesses, Cain\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    legal team have shown that an Australian donor policy based on safety of\r\n\
    sexual activity would see an HIV positive donation from a gay man slip\r\n\
    through donor screening and clinical testing once every 5769 years. In\r\n\
    other words, never.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Discrimination on the basis of characteristics over which we have no\r\n\
    control, and which do not impact on our capacity to do the job, is\r\n\
    always wrong. The law does not, and should not, allow it.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The fact that when it comes to blood donation, doing the right thing may\r\n\
    make the blood supply safer, and more safe blood available, means change\r\n\

    <p>Such questions may not be front of mind for our State MPs, but they\n\

    <p>The right to act according to the dictates of our conscience is founded\n\

    <p>It would be hard to overestimate the role autonomy-and so\n\
    conscience-plays in the value systems of contemporary Australian\n\
    society. Our political and legal structures are grounded in the belief,\n\
    to paraphrase High Court Justice McHugh, that autonomous individuals are\n\
    entitled to make, and are consequently responsible for their own\n\
    choices. Our health system, in line with that of others in the western\n\
    world, has shifted in the last few decades from the paternalistic idea\n\
    that doctors know best, to the view that patients have a right to make\n\
    their own informed choices about their care.</p>\n\n\
    <p>All this suggests what is true: that most learned discussions of\n\
    conscience focus on the duties lawmakers and medicos have to protect the\n\
    autonomy of citizens and patients. This is for good reason. Both our\n\
    elected representatives and health care staff are professionals: trusted\n\
    and respected members of society with a duty of care to those they are\n\
    sworn to serve and heal.</p>\n\n\

    with their rights when it comes to conscience, not their obligations.\n\
    Some MPs, understandably pleased at the rare opportunity to shrug off\n\
    party discipline, see a conscience vote as a chance for them to register\n\
    their own value positions on the issues at hand. In the same way,\n\
    conscience clauses in bills on euthanasia, abortion and ARTs tend to\n\
    spell out the entitlements of medical professionals to refuse treatment\n\
    they deem morally objectionable, but are silent on their obligations to\n\
    ensure patients get timely, appropriate care.</p>\n\n\
    <p>We need to get the balance right. Yes, the entitlements of MPs and\n\
    medical professionals to follow the dictates of their consciences are\n\
    part of the autonomy story. But if mutual obligation means anything,\n\
    then political and medical professionals who assert their right to vote\n\
    or to refuse care on grounds of conscience must take their\n\
    responsibilities to foster the autonomy of those they are bound to\n\
    serve-we citizens and patients-just as seriously.</p>\n\n\
    <p>They can do this by recognizing that it is unconscionable for someone to\n\

    <p>For politicians, this means thinking twice about using a conscience vote\n\

  title: Domestic Violence is a Two-Way Street
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 18:00:34
  content_markup: "<p>In the early 1990s I worked as a researcher for an organization\n\
    dedicated to finding accommodation for young, homeless women. Many of\n\
    these young women were escaping violent homes and, if they were lucky\n\
    enough to get a bed in a refuge, they often found more violence there.</p>\n\n\
    <p>My female co-workers thought they had the answer: single sex\n\
    accommodation. The only problem was that the actual and threatened\n\
    assaults the young women told me about were not just from angry young\n\
    men, but hardened young women who\xE2\x80\x99d been on the streets for years. Over\n\
    many months I dutifully reported to my superiors what the young women\n\
    told me: that they were as afraid of assaults from their own sex as from\n\
    the opposite one, but my findings were rejected as lies and distraction.\n\
    The earth was round, the sky was blue and women were victims of\n\
    violence, not perpetrators.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The job ended and I gave little thought to the issue. Until last week,\n\
    when a friend of mine-a gentle man with a heart of gold-told me\n\
    something that made his cheeks flame, and his typically brash voice fall\n\
    to a whisper.</p>\n\n\
    <p>His wife had hit him. Several times, and viciously, leaving him in so\n\
    much pain he feared a broken rib. He was clearly upset and I was\n\
    \\unsure what to say. So unsure that as he was telling me about how she\n\
    had followed him around the house, jabbing him, I blurted out, \xE2\x80\x9CBut\n\
    you\xE2\x80\x99re a decent sized bloke. Why didn\xE2\x80\x99t you stop her?\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Here\xE2\x80\x99s what he said. \xE2\x80\x9CI did. I restrained her, but I\xE2\x80\xA6I\xE2\x80\x99m a gentle\n\
    person. I don\xE2\x80\x99t want to hit her. I don\xE2\x80\x99t want to hit anyone. So she\n\
    would calm down and I would let her go and then, when I wasn\xE2\x80\x99t looking,\n\
    she\xE2\x80\x99d go me again.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Figures vary but studies suggest that around one in five Australian\n\
    women will experience relationship violence in their lifetime. The AMA\n\
    describes partner violence as an abuse of power, evidenced by the\n\
    domination, coercion, intimidation or victimisation of one person by\n\
    another using physical, sexual or emotional means.</p>\n\n\
    <p>While fewer both in number, and among those killed or seriously injured,\n\
    men can also be victims of spousal abuse. Victorian hospital admission\n\
    figures show that 1.3% of women and 0.14% of men are admitted to\n\
    casualty because of partner-inflicted injury.</p>\n\n\

  content: "In the early 1990s I worked as a researcher for an organization\r\n\
    dedicated to finding accommodation for young, homeless women. Many of\r\n\
    these young women were escaping violent homes and, if they were lucky\r\n\
    enough to get a bed in a refuge, they often found more violence there.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    My female co-workers thought they had the answer: single sex\r\n\
    accommodation. The only problem was that the actual and threatened\r\n\
    assaults the young women told me about were not just from angry young\r\n\
    men, but hardened young women who\xE2\x80\x99d been on the streets for years. Over\r\n\
    many months I dutifully reported to my superiors what the young women\r\n\
    told me: that they were as afraid of assaults from their own sex as from\r\n\
    the opposite one, but my findings were rejected as lies and distraction.\r\n\
    The earth was round, the sky was blue and women were victims of\r\n\
    violence, not perpetrators.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The job ended and I gave little thought to the issue. Until last week,\r\n\
    when a friend of mine-a gentle man with a heart of gold-told me\r\n\
    something that made his cheeks flame, and his typically brash voice fall\r\n\
    to a whisper.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    His wife had hit him. Several times, and viciously, leaving him in so\r\n\
    much pain he feared a broken rib. He was clearly upset and I was\r\n\
    \\\\unsure what to say. So unsure that as he was telling me about how she\r\n\
    had followed him around the house, jabbing him, I blurted out, \xE2\x80\x9CBut\r\n\
    you\xE2\x80\x99re a decent sized bloke. Why didn\xE2\x80\x99t you stop her?\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Here\xE2\x80\x99s what he said. \xE2\x80\x9CI did. I restrained her, but I\xE2\x80\xA6I\xE2\x80\x99m a gentle\r\n\
    person. I don\xE2\x80\x99t want to hit her. I don\xE2\x80\x99t want to hit anyone. So she\r\n\
    would calm down and I would let her go and then, when I wasn\xE2\x80\x99t looking,\r\n\
    she\xE2\x80\x99d go me again.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Figures vary but studies suggest that around one in five Australian\r\n\
    women will experience relationship violence in their lifetime. The AMA\r\n\
    describes partner violence as an abuse of power, evidenced by the\r\n\
    domination, coercion, intimidation or victimisation of one person by\r\n\
    another using physical, sexual or emotional means.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    While fewer both in number, and among those killed or seriously injured,\r\n\
    men can also be victims of spousal abuse. Victorian hospital admission\r\n\
    figures show that 1.3% of women and 0.14% of men are admitted to\r\n\
    casualty because of partner-inflicted injury.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Australia is sexist society. While the usual object of this charge is\r\n\
    the unconscious, deliberate and institutional biases that unjustly\r\n\
    discriminate against women in favour of men, when it comes to public\r\n\
    perceptions of domestic violence, it is men who suffer most. Actor Tom\r\n\
    Long, who played a man abducted and raped by three women in the 2006\r\n\

    his first reading of the script made him angry. \xE2\x80\x9CI didn\xE2\x80\x99t like the idea\r\n\
    of men losing their power. I wanted to call into question, well how can\r\n\
    women do that?\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But if domestic violence and rape are abuses of power, it is not hard to\r\n\
    understand how men can be victims. The superior physical power most men\r\n\
    have over most women does not grant them emotional mastery in domestic\r\n\
    confrontations.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    And while it seems wretched and grossly unfair, one thing violent women\r\n\
    can and do take advantage of is the lesson that good men have had\r\n\
    tattood on their souls since childhood.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Never ever raise your hand to a woman."

    pleased with the photos. In the wake of reporters staking out the school\n\
    and confused classmates asking questions, how might he be feeling now?\n\
    How ironic that those fueling the current hysteria claim to be concerned\n\

    and as a result the next child star of Star Wars 87 was born, would\n\

    <p>So my attention was snagged when the high-profile resignations of the\n\
    chief executive of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra Trevor Green and one\n\
    of the nation\xE2\x80\x99s most senior diplomats Ian Wilcock resigned from the\n\

    as long as they are men.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The club\xE2\x80\x99s ongoing refusal to consider membership applications from\n\
    women was unacceptable to both Green and Wilcock. \xE2\x80\x9CI cannot fully\n\
    express how disappointed I am with the outcome of the decision not to\n\
    make the club available to female membership,\xE2\x80\x9D Green wrote when he hung\n\
    up his towel. Said Wilcock: \xE2\x80\x9CI do not wish to spend any more time\n\
    pretending to respect the sensitivities of\xE2\x80\xA6men who\xE2\x80\xA6want to retreat to\n\
    some kind of boys\xE2\x80\x99 treehouse where they might be untroubled by half the\n\
    human race.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Let me state one thing very clearly: I see Green and Wilcock as highly\n\
    ethical men. Their willingness to stick their head above the parapet for\n\
    the opposite sex, bucking the Athenaeum\xE2\x80\x99s 140-year tradition and the\n\
    at-times underhanded tactics of the club\xE2\x80\x99s anti-women leadership, is\n\
    more than worthy of praise.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But even more praise-worthy are the men who are so desperate to, as\n\
    Wilcock put it \xE2\x80\x9Ccoax the club in to the 1970s\xE2\x80\x9D that they haven\xE2\x80\x99t\n\
    resigned. Instead, they\xE2\x80\x99ve stayed on to re-group and continue the fight.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I feel sure that, having fought so hard for the club to open their doors\n\
    to women, upstanding men like Former Victorian Liberal Party state\n\
    director John Ridley, Graeme Samuel, Eddie McGuire, Terry Moran, Jack\n\
    Smorgon, former Hawthorn president Ian Dicker and former federal health\n\
    minister Michael Wooldridge would have been bitterly disappointed when\n\
    the vote was lost. But despite being told in unequivocal terms to pull\n\
    their heads in, these men have battled on.</p>\n\n\
    <p>A resignation, even a high-profile one, is a splash in the pan. A day at\n\
    most of media sizzle-a piece in the back pages of the \\\n\
    newspaper and then, gone. Not enough exposure of the issue to get the\n\
    public so hopping mad they start barracking for change and when all the\n\
    fizz and sparkle dies away, the same old organization is still standing,\n\
    but now minus one of the brave and principled members who could have\n\
    forced a change.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This is the problem with leaving-you are gone. However, noble the\n\
    intentions, resignations designed to draw attention to an injustice can,\n\
    numbers being what they are, perpetuate it.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This is essentially what has happened to Australia\xE2\x80\x99s Christian\n\
    communities. Progressive Christians, unable to cope with the turning\n\
    away of the Church from achieving social and environmental justice and\n\
    world peace, have deserted in droves. The consequence? A volcanic\n\
    expansion of the influence of those who remain and, as a consequence, a\n\
    Church even more focused on personal moral issues like abortion.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Sometimes there is no choice. Sometimes the rot in Denmark is so deep\n\
    and pervasive that the only solution is to flee the state. But\n\
    sometimes, no matter how satisfying a good resignation can be, a real\n\
    difference can only be made if you stay, not go.</p>\n"

    I feel sure that, having fought so hard for the club to open their doors\r\n\
    to women, upstanding men like Former Victorian Liberal Party state\r\n\
    director John Ridley, Graeme Samuel, Eddie McGuire, Terry Moran, Jack\r\n\
    Smorgon, former Hawthorn president Ian Dicker and former federal health\r\n\
    minister Michael Wooldridge would have been bitterly disappointed when\r\n\
    the vote was lost. But despite being told in unequivocal terms to pull\r\n\
    their heads in, these men have battled on.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    A resignation, even a high-profile one, is a splash in the pan. A day at\r\n\
    most of media sizzle-a piece in the back pages of the \\\r\n\
    newspaper and then, gone. Not enough exposure of the issue to get the\r\n\
    public so hopping mad they start barracking for change and when all the\r\n\
    fizz and sparkle dies away, the same old organization is still standing,\r\n\
    but now minus one of the brave and principled members who could have\r\n\
    forced a change.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This is the problem with leaving-you are gone. However, noble the\r\n\
    intentions, resignations designed to draw attention to an injustice can,\r\n\
    numbers being what they are, perpetuate it.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This is essentially what has happened to Australia\xE2\x80\x99s Christian\r\n\
    communities. Progressive Christians, unable to cope with the turning\r\n\
    away of the Church from achieving social and environmental justice and\r\n\
    world peace, have deserted in droves. The consequence? A volcanic\r\n\
    expansion of the influence of those who remain and, as a consequence, a\r\n\
    Church even more focused on personal moral issues like abortion.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Sometimes there is no choice. Sometimes the rot in Denmark is so deep\r\n\
    and pervasive that the only solution is to flee the state. But\r\n\
    sometimes, no matter how satisfying a good resignation can be, a real\r\n\
    difference can only be made if you stay, not go."

    problems for clinicians and the families of critically ill patients.\n\
    These problems include a mismatch between the way death is defined and\n\

    and tubes inserted while the heart is still beating). In one survey 20%\n\

  content_markup: "<blockquote><p>Our Father, who art in heaven. Hallowed be thy name.</p></blockquote>\n\n\
    <p>TEASE: This week, in a rare moment of bi-partisanship, the Federal\n\
    Government and Opposition joined forces to reject Speaker Harry\n\
    Jenkins\xE2\x80\x99s call for a debate on whether the Lord\xE2\x80\x99s Prayer should continue\n\
    to be said at the start of each parliamentary day.</p>\n\n\
    <blockquote><p>Thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven</p></blockquote>\n\n\
    <p>We all know it. Hell, I\xE2\x80\x99m Jewish and can recite it backwards. Anyone\n\
    raised in a Christian-dominated culture like the US or Australia could.\n\
    While opponents of a debate on the prayer claim this makes it\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cuniversal,\xE2\x80\x9D unless they mean \xE2\x80\x9Cecumenical,\xE2\x80\x9D they are mistaken. While\n\
    several billion Catholics, Protestants and Eastern Orthodox Christians\n\
    come together at Easter to chant the prayer, it is doubtful that\n\
    followers of any of the other world\xE2\x80\x99s religions join in. Not to mention\n\
    the silence of the growing army of atheists.</p>\n\n\
    <blockquote><p>Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive us our trespasses as we\n\
    forgive those who trespass against us</p></blockquote>\n\n\
    <p>Its defenders tell us that the Lord\xE2\x80\x99s Prayer has begun Parliament since\n\
    1901. As part of our history and tradition, it must continue to do so.\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9COur nation was founded on faith in the Bible and on prayer,\xE2\x80\x9D said a\n\
    letter-writer to The Canberra Times. \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s appropriate that we open\n\
    parliaments with the Lord\xE2\x80\x99s Prayer for its cultural and historic\n\
    relevance,\xE2\x80\x9D agreed the Australian Christian Lobby\xE2\x80\x99s Jim Wallace.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Ritual and tradition express our most profound beliefs and values. They\n\
    risk irrelevance, even ridicule, if they fail to change with the times.\n\
    In 1901 neither Aborigines nor the majority of Australian women had the\n\
    right to vote or to stand for a seat in the new commonwealth parliament.\n\
    If parliament began each day with an ode to the political supremacy of\n\
    white men, would anyone cite \xE2\x80\x9Ctradition\xE2\x80\x9D as a good reason to preserve\n\
    it? Opponents of a debate about the Lord\xE2\x80\x99s Prayer must explain why its\n\
    continued recitation is in line with the values and aspirations of\n\
    contemporary Australia, not those of yesteryear.</p>\n\n\
    <blockquote><p>Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.</p></blockquote>\n\n\
    <p>Don\xE2\x80\x99t believe in sin? Have little truck with evil? Opponents of a debate\n\
    have the answer for you: just say silent when the prayer is read. They\n\
    say that surely with the world economy turning molten, there are far\n\
    more important matters to discussion.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Ah, deflection and trivialisation-the last argumentative refuge of\n\
    scoundrels. It reminds me of how men used to guillotine feminists by\n\
    accusing them of lacking a sense of humour.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Those objecting to the Lord\xE2\x80\x99s Prayer do so on principle. The principle\n\
    is that in a multi-ethnic and multi-religious society like Australia,\n\
    church and state should be separate.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Christians defend their right to question and even refuse to follow laws\n\
    that conflict with their principles. In response, they are rarely told\n\
    to take a deep breath and get over themselves. This may be because we\n\
    tend to assume that those motivated to act from their Christian faith\n\
    are moral agents who, agree with them or not, deserve to be taken\n\
    seriously.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Well, I say that non-Christians also have consciences that drive them to\n\
    stand up for what they believe. They too deserve a hearing and to have\n\

    \r\n\
    TEASE: This week, in a rare moment of bi-partisanship, the Federal\r\n\
    Government and Opposition joined forces to reject Speaker Harry\r\n\
    Jenkins\xE2\x80\x99s call for a debate on whether the Lord\xE2\x80\x99s Prayer should continue\r\n\
    to be said at the start of each parliamentary day.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    > Thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven\r\n\
    \r\n\
    We all know it. Hell, I\xE2\x80\x99m Jewish and can recite it backwards. Anyone\r\n\
    raised in a Christian-dominated culture like the US or Australia could.\r\n\
    While opponents of a debate on the prayer claim this makes it\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cuniversal,\xE2\x80\x9D unless they mean \xE2\x80\x9Cecumenical,\xE2\x80\x9D they are mistaken. While\r\n\
    several billion Catholics, Protestants and Eastern Orthodox Christians\r\n\
    come together at Easter to chant the prayer, it is doubtful that\r\n\
    followers of any of the other world\xE2\x80\x99s religions join in. Not to mention\r\n\
    the silence of the growing army of atheists.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    > Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive us our trespasses as we\r\n\
    > forgive those who trespass against us\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Its defenders tell us that the Lord\xE2\x80\x99s Prayer has begun Parliament since\r\n\
    1901. As part of our history and tradition, it must continue to do so.\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9COur nation was founded on faith in the Bible and on prayer,\xE2\x80\x9D said a\r\n\
    letter-writer to The Canberra Times. \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s appropriate that we open\r\n\
    parliaments with the Lord\xE2\x80\x99s Prayer for its cultural and historic\r\n\
    relevance,\xE2\x80\x9D agreed the Australian Christian Lobby\xE2\x80\x99s Jim Wallace.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Ritual and tradition express our most profound beliefs and values. They\r\n\
    risk irrelevance, even ridicule, if they fail to change with the times.\r\n\
    In 1901 neither Aborigines nor the majority of Australian women had the\r\n\
    right to vote or to stand for a seat in the new commonwealth parliament.\r\n\
    If parliament began each day with an ode to the political supremacy of\r\n\
    white men, would anyone cite \xE2\x80\x9Ctradition\xE2\x80\x9D as a good reason to preserve\r\n\
    it? Opponents of a debate about the Lord\xE2\x80\x99s Prayer must explain why its\r\n\
    continued recitation is in line with the values and aspirations of\r\n\
    contemporary Australia, not those of yesteryear.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    > Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Don\xE2\x80\x99t believe in sin? Have little truck with evil? Opponents of a debate\r\n\
    have the answer for you: just say silent when the prayer is read. They\r\n\
    say that surely with the world economy turning molten, there are far\r\n\
    more important matters to discussion.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Ah, deflection and trivialisation-the last argumentative refuge of\r\n\
    scoundrels. It reminds me of how men used to guillotine feminists by\r\n\
    accusing them of lacking a sense of humour.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Those objecting to the Lord\xE2\x80\x99s Prayer do so on principle. The principle\r\n\
    is that in a multi-ethnic and multi-religious society like Australia,\r\n\
    church and state should be separate.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Christians defend their right to question and even refuse to follow laws\r\n\
    that conflict with their principles. In response, they are rarely told\r\n\
    to take a deep breath and get over themselves. This may be because we\r\n\
    tend to assume that those motivated to act from their Christian faith\r\n\
    are moral agents who, agree with them or not, deserve to be taken\r\n\
    seriously.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Well, I say that non-Christians also have consciences that drive them to\r\n\
    stand up for what they believe. They too deserve a hearing and to have\r\n\
    their moral concerns treated with respect.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    If Christian concerns were enough to spark a Senate inquiry into\r\n\
    Medicare funding of abortions necessary to save a woman\xE2\x80\x99s life, surely\r\n\
    non-Christian ones should be enough to allow discussion of the ongoing\r\n\
    relevance of the Lord\xE2\x80\x99s Prayer.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    > Amen."

    lesbian, as a colleague of mine did recently, so that younger gays in\n\

    gives men more people to protect, and so more opportunities to display\n\
    courage, when the bullets start flying.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But the gender connection with courage may be on its way out, if its not\n\
    part of the past already. Women today are doctors and emergency service\n\

    gives men more people to protect, and so more opportunities to display\r\n\
    courage, when the bullets start flying.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But the gender connection with courage may be on its way out, if its not\r\n\
    part of the past already. Women today are doctors and emergency service\r\n\
    workers, while men can be the primary carers of their kids. Using gender\r\n\
    as a shorthand way of deciding who should be the hero in a modern crisis\r\n\
    may be past its use -by date."

    paid to pamper their psyches.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Dumpers say things like this. \xE2\x80\x9CI was thinking about getting a bit of\n\
    fringe because I wanted something different. I am starting to look my\n\
    age.\xE2\x80\x9D They say, \xE2\x80\x9CYou know what it\xE2\x80\x99s like in London. And now the service\n\
    is even worse.\xE2\x80\x9D They say, \xE2\x80\x9CI went to that new gym I was telling you\n\
    about. Very reasonably priced but it was a bit rushed. I just want to go\n\
    afterwards and have my coffee and my afternoon but I just don\xE2\x80\x99t know.\n\
    It\xE2\x80\x99s so hard to know what to do.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>They say these things to hairdressers whose best friends will never grow\n\
    old because they died that week in a car accident. They say them to\n\
    manicurists who have never been to London and will never go because they\n\
    can\xE2\x80\x99t afford to take a holiday. Ever. They say them to personal trainers\n\
    who have mortgaged themselves to the hilt to buy their own gym, but may\n\
    now go broke because their wives just left them.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Do dumpers know this? Most of them do, and if they don\xE2\x80\x99t, they should.\n\
    They should because finding out requires nothing more then the temporary\n\
    shutting of their own trap, and the responding to the other like they\n\

    all, then spend the time and energy necessary to achieve world peace in\n\

    fail to arrive.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Refusing to ask for what you want, or to say no to what you don\xE2\x80\x99t, is a\n\

  content_markup: "<p>Defenders of torture are fond of the ticking bomb scenario. It describes\n\
    a terrorist who has planted bombs around a city that are set to blow,\n\
    but who refuses to tell authorities where they are. The implicit claim\n\
    of the scenario is clear. That in some cases, in particular where lives\n\
    are at stake and time is running short, torture may be justified.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Opponents of torture disagree. They say that real-world crimes, not\n\
    artificial and oversimplified academic thought experiments designed to\n\
    get students thinking, should form the basis of our moral and policy\n\
    approach to torture. They say actual cases possessed of all the features\n\
    of the ticking bomb scenario-the features that justify torture-are very,\n\
    very rare.</p>\n\n\
    <p>There are many other arguments against torture, ones based on reason and\n\
    evidence rather than, as is the case with the ticking bomb scenario,\n\
    manipulative emotion. These include the fact that no less than the\n\
    Centre for Strategic Intelligence Research at the Washington-based\n\
    National Defense Intelligence College says there is no evidence that\n\
    torture works. They also include the fact that torture violates the UN\n\
    Convention Against Torture and, consequently, the moral authority of\n\
    countries like Australia that have signed it (including our capacity to\n\
    protest when our citizens are tortured by other nations).</p>\n\n\
    <p>And the hits keep coming. As a radio documentary just aired on ABC radio\n\
    makes clear, when the moral prohibition on torture is transgressed, it\n\
    can be the torturer-as well as the tortured-who suffers.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The program follows the life and tragic death of American Adam Gray.\n\
    Gray served in Iraq and returned home with acute post-traumatic stress\n\
    disorder caused, according to his mother and the mates that served with\n\
    him in 68th Armor unit, by his inability to come to terms with what he\n\
    had done to the prisoners in his charge while he was there. While\n\
    training for his next deployment, Gray attempted suicide and, three\n\
    weeks later, was found dead in his barracks from what the military\n\
    describes as an accidental drug overdose.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Those who served with Gray have little doubt about what really killed\n\
    their friend and what will be the death of them too, if they fail to\n\
    take necessary measures to tend their own psychological scars. Scars\n\
    caused by their inability to forgive themselves for the wrongs they did\n\
    while on tour and the disconnect between their self-image as moral men\n\
    and their knowledge of what they did and said in times of war. \\\n\
    Said one soldier, \xE2\x80\x9CYou don\xE2\x80\x99t just forget what you\xE2\x80\x99re capable of doing.\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    Admitted another, \xE2\x80\x9CI went to confession, went to counseling, I still\n\
    can\xE2\x80\x99t forgive myself.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>What did Gray and his fellow soldiers do? They blasted music in the ears\n\
    of detainees to keep them awake and poured water over their mouths and\n\
    noses to simulate drowning. They put them in stress positions and left\n\
    them there for days without sleep, water or food.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Not all the soldiers did these things, or would have done them-even\n\
    under duress. But as the \xE2\x80\x9CObedience to Authority\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9CStanford Prison\xE2\x80\x9D\n\

    and Gus\xE2\x80\x99s wife Karin, play along. \xE2\x80\x9CBut everyone will laugh at him,\xE2\x80\x9D Gus\r\n\
    protests. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd you too,\xE2\x80\x9D the doctor agrees.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But they don\xE2\x80\x99t. No one laughs. Not Karin\xE2\x80\x99s friends, or Gus\xE2\x80\x99s workmates\r\n\
    (\xE2\x80\x9CWish I had a woman that couldn\xE2\x80\x99t talk,\xE2\x80\x9D says one. \xE2\x80\x9CShe have a sister?\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    inquires a customer). Even the church elders eventually get on board.\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CWe don\xE2\x80\x99t want anything to do with her,\xE2\x80\x9D protests Arnie. \xE2\x80\x9CShe\xE2\x80\x99s a golden\r\n\
    calf. And we all know what happened with that.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9COh, for heaven\xE2\x80\x99s sake! What\xE2\x80\x99s the big deal!\xE2\x80\x9D snaps Mrs Grinner,\r\n\
    addressing each of the group in turn. \xE2\x80\x9CSally, your cousin puts dresses\r\n\
    on his cats. Hazel, your nephew gave all his money to a UFO club. Arnie,\r\n\
    everyone knows your first wife was a klepto\xE2\x80\xA6These things happen. Lars is\r\n\
    a good boy. You can depend on me.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    History and philosophy tend to focus on great moments of choice faced by\r\n\
    important people. What I loved about *Lars* was its poignant recognition\r\n\
    that the religious turn foul when they forget the Golden Rule, and that\r\n\
    there is nothing exotic about ethics. They can be found in the everyday\r\n\
    acts and omissions of us all.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I am constantly moved by how hard people try to be moral, and how often\r\n\
    they get it right.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Thanks for taking the time to read and write to me this year. Happy\r\n\
    holidays to you all."

  updated_on: 2011-03-24 18:06:22
  content_markup: "<p>On Tuesday, Crikey broke a story about conservative magazine Quadrant\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    publication of an essay on scientific criticism by Sharon Gould. Gould\n\
    is described as having a PhD in Applied Science (biotechnology) and\n\
    being employed as a biotechnology informatics consultant.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But Gould is not a real person. Her essay, \xE2\x80\x9CScare campaigns and science\n\
    reporting,\xE2\x80\x9D was a hoax, as Quadrant editor and cultural warrior Keith\n\
    Windshuttle discovered to his dismay when the journalist who broke the\n\
    story, Margaret Simons, rang him for comment. According to Simons, the\n\
    essay contained \xE2\x80\x9Cfalse science, logical leaps, outrageous claims and a\n\
    mixture of genuine and bogus footnotes,\xE2\x80\x9D that Windshuttle should have\n\
    spotted.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Some journalists have treated the story with glee, setting off like\n\
    hounds after Gould\xE2\x80\x99s real identity. Windshuttle\xE2\x80\x99s nemesis, historian and\n\
    former Quadrant editor Robert Manne, was no less restrained. He told The\n\
    Age that he had \xE2\x80\x9Ctears rolling down [his] cheeks\xE2\x80\x9D while reading the\n\
    bogus essay.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I don\xE2\x80\x99t think we need to know Gould\xE2\x80\x99s true identity or to laugh at the\n\
    elegance of the sting, which was designed to humiliate Windshuttle, and\n\
    cast doubt on the integrity of the conservative ideology he espouses. I\n\
    think we need to judge whether the hoax was fair. Or fair enough.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The use of shame and humiliation to discipline those who break the rules\n\
    and flout the powerful has fallen out of fashion in recent years, but is\n\
    central to hoaxes. The Ern Malley scam of the 1940s saw two traditional\n\
    poets publish what they saw as slapdash pretentious rubbish in an\n\
    avant-garde literary journal. More recently, American physics Professor\n\
    Alan Sokal exposed the acceptance of a paper \xE2\x80\x9Cliberally salted with\n\
    nonsense\xE2\x80\x9D by editors of a cultural studies journal. Sokal claimed the\n\
    publication of his article proved that some disciplines would accept\n\
    anything as legitimate scholarship as long as it \xE2\x80\x9Csounded good\xE2\x80\x9D and\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cflattered the editors\xE2\x80\x99 ideological preconceptions.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>While embarrassment of individuals is the vehicle by which hoaxes take\n\
    effect, this is not always the primary objective. Often, the main game\n\
    is the slaying, through ridicule, of intellectual interlopers. Those\n\
    artists or scholars who dare to challenge existing orthodoxies and, by\n\
    so doing, threaten the power of those who promulgate them. Both Malley\n\
    and Sokal fall into this category.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But the latest hoax offers something new. Instead of orthodox\n\
    practitioners (traditional poets, scientists) holding their nascent\n\
    challengers (post-modernists, humanities academics) up for laughs, the\n\
    Windshuttle affair sees the intellectual gatecrashers fighting back. As\n\

    just by challenging the accuracy of some footnotes in the work of\n\
    historians like Henry Reynolds, but by suggesting their errors were part\n\
    of a deliberate attempt to deceive Australians about the true facts of\n\
    history. Such charges are extremely serious, going to the personal and\n\
    professional integrity of these scholars. Scholars whose substantive\n\
    views about Australia\xE2\x80\x99s early history he did not like. To be hoisted on\n\

  content: "On Tuesday, Crikey broke a story about conservative magazine Quadrant\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    publication of an essay on scientific criticism by Sharon Gould. Gould\r\n\
    is described as having a PhD in Applied Science (biotechnology) and\r\n\
    being employed as a biotechnology informatics consultant.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But Gould is not a real person. Her essay, \xE2\x80\x9CScare campaigns and science\r\n\
    reporting,\xE2\x80\x9D was a hoax, as Quadrant editor and cultural warrior Keith\r\n\
    Windshuttle discovered to his dismay when the journalist who broke the\r\n\
    story, Margaret Simons, rang him for comment. According to Simons, the\r\n\
    essay contained \xE2\x80\x9Cfalse science, logical leaps, outrageous claims and a\r\n\
    mixture of genuine and bogus footnotes,\xE2\x80\x9D that Windshuttle should have\r\n\
    spotted.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Some journalists have treated the story with glee, setting off like\r\n\
    hounds after Gould\xE2\x80\x99s real identity. Windshuttle\xE2\x80\x99s nemesis, historian and\r\n\
    former Quadrant editor Robert Manne, was no less restrained. He told The\r\n\
    Age that he had \xE2\x80\x9Ctears rolling down [his] cheeks\xE2\x80\x9D while reading the\r\n\
    bogus essay.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I don\xE2\x80\x99t think we need to know Gould\xE2\x80\x99s true identity or to laugh at the\r\n\
    elegance of the sting, which was designed to humiliate Windshuttle, and\r\n\
    cast doubt on the integrity of the conservative ideology he espouses. I\r\n\
    think we need to judge whether the hoax was fair. Or fair enough.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The use of shame and humiliation to discipline those who break the rules\r\n\
    and flout the powerful has fallen out of fashion in recent years, but is\r\n\
    central to hoaxes. The Ern Malley scam of the 1940s saw two traditional\r\n\
    poets publish what they saw as slapdash pretentious rubbish in an\r\n\
    avant-garde literary journal. More recently, American physics Professor\r\n\
    Alan Sokal exposed the acceptance of a paper \xE2\x80\x9Cliberally salted with\r\n\
    nonsense\xE2\x80\x9D by editors of a cultural studies journal. Sokal claimed the\r\n\
    publication of his article proved that some disciplines would accept\r\n\
    anything as legitimate scholarship as long as it \xE2\x80\x9Csounded good\xE2\x80\x9D and\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cflattered the editors\xE2\x80\x99 ideological preconceptions.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    While embarrassment of individuals is the vehicle by which hoaxes take\r\n\
    effect, this is not always the primary objective. Often, the main game\r\n\
    is the slaying, through ridicule, of intellectual interlopers. Those\r\n\
    artists or scholars who dare to challenge existing orthodoxies and, by\r\n\
    so doing, threaten the power of those who promulgate them. Both Malley\r\n\
    and Sokal fall into this category.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But the latest hoax offers something new. Instead of orthodox\r\n\
    practitioners (traditional poets, scientists) holding their nascent\r\n\
    challengers (post-modernists, humanities academics) up for laughs, the\r\n\
    Windshuttle affair sees the intellectual gatecrashers fighting back. As\r\n\
    the hoaxer explains it, the Gould essay \xE2\x80\x9Cderides\xE2\x80\x9D the \xE2\x80\x9Cvery\r\n\
    constructivist arguments\xE2\x80\x9D used in the climate-change denial articles\r\n\
    regularly published in Quadrant. Indeed, it\xE2\x80\x99s hard not to feel that\r\n\
    insofar as the cultural left evinces exuberance about Windshuttle\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    downfall, this flows from relief that, for once, they are not the ones\r\n\

    \r\n\

  title: Whats Wrong with Adults Paying for Sex
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 18:06:11
  content_markup: "<p>This summer, Norway has quietly joined Sweden in outlawing paid sex. Men\n\
    who have sex with prostitutes working in brothels or on the street face\n\
    hefty fines or six months in gaol, while the women involved will be\n\
    offered assistance to exit the industry. \xE2\x80\x9CWe want to send a clear\n\
    message to men that buying sex is unacceptable,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Norwegian\n\
    Justice Minister, echoing the sentiments of Swedish detective Kajsa\n\
    Wahlberg. \xE2\x80\x9CWe don\xE2\x80\x99t have a problem with prostitutes. We have a problem\n\
    with men who buy sex.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Sweden\xE2\x80\x99s first attempts to move away from a liberal, harm-minimisation\n\
    approach to prostitution began in 1997. Then, everyone laughed. No one\n\
    is laughing now, with a number of EU countries having either adopted\n\
    elements of the recriminalisation approach, or considering doing so in\n\
    the future. Australia could be next. The \xE2\x80\x9Cwomen-as-victim\xE2\x80\x9D paradigm on\n\
    which recriminalisation is based is the brain-child of radical English\n\
    feminist Sheila Jeffreys, now based in Melbourne, and is supported by\n\
    conservative Christian groups like Women\xE2\x80\x99s Forum Australia and the\n\
    Australian Christian Lobby.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Prostitution and substance-abuse pose significant policy dilemmas for\n\
    liberal democratic societies. This is because the foundational claim of\n\
    such political cultures-that competent, rational citizens are entitled\n\
    to make their own decisions, even if we think they are wrong-clash with\n\
    the widely shared view that some choices are not just mistaken, but\n\
    harmful for those involved and for society at large. Recriminalisation\n\
    capitalises on this conundrum in two ways.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Firstly, by conflating things that should remain separate to make the\n\
    problem seem larger, and the harms greater, than they are. Making paid,\n\
    consensual sex in a legal brothel the same as sex slavery; the one-time\n\
    use by a student of marijuana as no different to heroin addiction.\n\
    Secondly, by manipulating our reflexive sympathy for the vulnerable into\n\
    agreement that for some people, choice is a hazard, and so need not be\n\
    defended. Instead, we just need to say, \xE2\x80\x9Cno.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>I\xE2\x80\x99m not convinced. Prohibitionist rhetoric and policy has a lousy track\n\
    record, no matter how desperately radical feminists and conservative\n\
    Christians join forces to convince us otherwise. Sure, it may work for\n\
    some people in some cases, but the resistant rump are just forced\n\
    underground, attracting both shame and stigma as they descend. Like it\n\
    or not, substance use and paid sex will always be with us. Criminalising\n\
    them just makes it harder for harm minimisation policies aimed at\n\
    preventing the transmission of HIV/AIDS and minimising the risk of\n\
    violence to succeed.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Just as worrying is the harm caused to those that the new approach\n\
    reinscribes as victims. The language is telling. Liberals speak of sex\n\
    workers and drug users. Paternalists describe prostituted women and\n\
    addicts-adults incapable of making good choices and so requiring legal\n\
    rescue from their consequences.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Women, in particular should beware. Professor Jeffreys says the\n\
    subjugation of the prostituted woman is a microcosm of all women\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    domination by men. She faults straight sex, which she sees as the means\n\
    by which men maintain power over women and perpetuate the patriarchy,\n\
    which explains her belief that real feminists must be lesbians. What\n\
    social re-jigs might be required to resist such subjugation is anyone\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    guess, though I\xE2\x80\x99m sure it will be for our own good.</p>\n\n\
    <p>And here lies the problem. Exploited people &ndash; women, drug-users &ndash; may\n\
    deserve our pity, but they don\xE2\x80\x99t deserve our trust. We need to empower\n\
    people to make better choices, not deny them any chance to control their\n\
    lives.</p>\n"

    who have sex with prostitutes working in brothels or on the street face\r\n\
    hefty fines or six months in gaol, while the women involved will be\r\n\
    offered assistance to exit the industry. \xE2\x80\x9CWe want to send a clear\r\n\
    message to men that buying sex is unacceptable,\xE2\x80\x9D said the Norwegian\r\n\
    Justice Minister, echoing the sentiments of Swedish detective Kajsa\r\n\
    Wahlberg. \xE2\x80\x9CWe don\xE2\x80\x99t have a problem with prostitutes. We have a problem\r\n\
    with men who buy sex.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Sweden\xE2\x80\x99s first attempts to move away from a liberal, harm-minimisation\r\n\
    approach to prostitution began in 1997. Then, everyone laughed. No one\r\n\
    is laughing now, with a number of EU countries having either adopted\r\n\
    elements of the recriminalisation approach, or considering doing so in\r\n\
    the future. Australia could be next. The \xE2\x80\x9Cwomen-as-victim\xE2\x80\x9D paradigm on\r\n\
    which recriminalisation is based is the brain-child of radical English\r\n\
    feminist Sheila Jeffreys, now based in Melbourne, and is supported by\r\n\
    conservative Christian groups like Women\xE2\x80\x99s Forum Australia and the\r\n\
    Australian Christian Lobby.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Prostitution and substance-abuse pose significant policy dilemmas for\r\n\
    liberal democratic societies. This is because the foundational claim of\r\n\
    such political cultures-that competent, rational citizens are entitled\r\n\
    to make their own decisions, even if we think they are wrong-clash with\r\n\
    the widely shared view that some choices are not just mistaken, but\r\n\
    harmful for those involved and for society at large. Recriminalisation\r\n\
    capitalises on this conundrum in two ways.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Firstly, by conflating things that should remain separate to make the\r\n\
    problem seem larger, and the harms greater, than they are. Making paid,\r\n\
    consensual sex in a legal brothel the same as sex slavery; the one-time\r\n\
    use by a student of marijuana as no different to heroin addiction.\r\n\
    Secondly, by manipulating our reflexive sympathy for the vulnerable into\r\n\
    agreement that for some people, choice is a hazard, and so need not be\r\n\
    defended. Instead, we just need to say, \xE2\x80\x9Cno.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I\xE2\x80\x99m not convinced. Prohibitionist rhetoric and policy has a lousy track\r\n\
    record, no matter how desperately radical feminists and conservative\r\n\
    Christians join forces to convince us otherwise. Sure, it may work for\r\n\
    some people in some cases, but the resistant rump are just forced\r\n\
    underground, attracting both shame and stigma as they descend. Like it\r\n\
    or not, substance use and paid sex will always be with us. Criminalising\r\n\
    them just makes it harder for harm minimisation policies aimed at\r\n\
    preventing the transmission of HIV/AIDS and minimising the risk of\r\n\
    violence to succeed.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Just as worrying is the harm caused to those that the new approach\r\n\
    reinscribes as victims. The language is telling. Liberals speak of sex\r\n\
    workers and drug users. Paternalists describe prostituted women and\r\n\
    addicts-adults incapable of making good choices and so requiring legal\r\n\
    rescue from their consequences.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Women, in particular should beware. Professor Jeffreys says the\r\n\
    subjugation of the prostituted woman is a microcosm of all women\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    domination by men. She faults straight sex, which she sees as the means\r\n\
    by which men maintain power over women and perpetuate the patriarchy,\r\n\
    which explains her belief that real feminists must be lesbians. What\r\n\
    social re-jigs might be required to resist such subjugation is anyone\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    guess, though I\xE2\x80\x99m sure it will be for our own good.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    And here lies the problem. Exploited people - women, drug-users - may\r\n\
    deserve our pity, but they don\xE2\x80\x99t deserve our trust. We need to empower\r\n\
    people to make better choices, not deny them any chance to control their\r\n\
    lives."

  content_markup: "<p>We expect a lot of our media. Not more than we should, but a decent\n\
    amount, often without either acknowledging the importance of a free\n\
    press to democracy, or the structural factors that can get in the way of\n\
    well-meaning journalists doing the right thing.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In the hot seat this week has been media coverage of the Victorian\n\
    bushfires. Less then a week into the tragedy, some journalists were\n\
    accusing their colleagues of peddling \xE2\x80\x9Cgrief porn,\xE2\x80\x9D while others were\n\
    dirty on the quality of the saturation coverage, and the motivations\n\
    behind it. Public self-flagellation turned to high farce when Fairfax\n\
    columnist Ross Gittens laid blame for much journalistic excess at the\n\
    public\xE2\x80\x99s door, which he claimed \xE2\x80\x9Cenjoys\xE2\x80\x9D a \xE2\x80\x9Cgood natural disaster\xE2\x80\x9D and\n\
    relies on the media to give their feelings of sympathy, sorrow and grief\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Ca good workout.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>I come to both praise the media, and to bury it.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The media plays a critical role in disseminating information in a\n\
    crisis. Our media, in particular the ABC, did an excellent job of\n\
    keeping Victorians informed. Rolling coverage of the location of fires,\n\
    and threat warnings by the CFA, were essential for bush-dwellers needing\n\
    to decide whether to prepare, stay and defend or leave early. Indeed, a\n\
    community meeting at Kinglake, one of the communities devastated by the\n\
    blaze, agreed that, \xE2\x80\x9C99% of the coverage had been great.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Does this mean that no reporters or news outlets ever stepped over the\n\
    line? Of course they did but everyone makes mistakes, and all\n\
    professions have their bottom-feeders. Perhaps sadly, journalism is no\n\
    different.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Now the burial. The most irksome aspect of the bush-fire coverage is the\n\
    public navel-gazing currently being undertaken by the media about the\n\
    way it has covered the disaster. There\xE2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with the media\n\
    using the media to yak about itself. It\xE2\x80\x99s an important and powerful\n\
    institution and the way it goes about its business is a matter of public\n\
    concern. Rather, what worries me about the public self-flagellation is\n\
    that it will not solve the problem. Indeed, over-rating the importance\n\
    of such full-frontal introspection might deter the deliberate and\n\
    concerted action needed to actually fix the problem.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So what should we be doing?</p>\n\n\
    <p>We need to accept that we can change. All we need is the will, and a\n\
    decision to convene a round-table, with media representatives, relevant\n\
    government departments, disaster relief organizations and trauma\n\
    experts, to develop guidelines for reporting on disasters and strategies\n\
    for getting the media to adhere to such rules in their day-to-day work.</p>\n\n\
    <p>There are precedents for such an approach. Several years ago, concerns\n\
    surfaced about the risks posed to vulnerable members of the community by\n\
    careless media reporting of suicide. In response, a number of considered\n\
    and practical guidelines were developed to assist media organisations to\n\
    understand the potential for harm, and how their reporting could avoid\n\
    it. Many Australian journalists are exposed to the guidelines during\n\
    their training or when they first hit the newsroom and, by and large,\n\
    media organs honour them in the observance rather than the breech.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Disasters have terrible, but similar contours. We need a code of conduct\n\
    for reporting on such happenings that is ethical, relevant and workable.\n\
    That attempts to balance the media\xE2\x80\x99s obligations to inform people about\n\
    what goes on in their name and in their midst, against the risk of harm\n\
    that some sorts of reporting can cause to those at the epicenter of a\n\
    disaster, and those watching on.</p>\n"

    public\xE2\x80\x99s door, which he claimed \xE2\x80\x9Cenjoys\xE2\x80\x9D a \xE2\x80\x9Cgood natural disaster\xE2\x80\x9D and\r\n\
    relies on the media to give their feelings of sympathy, sorrow and grief\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Ca good workout.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I come to both praise the media, and to bury it.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The media plays a critical role in disseminating information in a\r\n\
    crisis. Our media, in particular the ABC, did an excellent job of\r\n\
    keeping Victorians informed. Rolling coverage of the location of fires,\r\n\
    and threat warnings by the CFA, were essential for bush-dwellers needing\r\n\
    to decide whether to prepare, stay and defend or leave early. Indeed, a\r\n\
    community meeting at Kinglake, one of the communities devastated by the\r\n\
    blaze, agreed that, \xE2\x80\x9C99% of the coverage had been great.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Does this mean that no reporters or news outlets ever stepped over the\r\n\
    line? Of course they did but everyone makes mistakes, and all\r\n\
    professions have their bottom-feeders. Perhaps sadly, journalism is no\r\n\
    different.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Now the burial. The most irksome aspect of the bush-fire coverage is the\r\n\
    public navel-gazing currently being undertaken by the media about the\r\n\
    way it has covered the disaster. There\xE2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with the media\r\n\
    using the media to yak about itself. It\xE2\x80\x99s an important and powerful\r\n\
    institution and the way it goes about its business is a matter of public\r\n\
    concern. Rather, what worries me about the public self-flagellation is\r\n\
    that it will not solve the problem. Indeed, over-rating the importance\r\n\
    of such full-frontal introspection might deter the deliberate and\r\n\
    concerted action needed to actually fix the problem.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So what should we be doing?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    We need to accept that we can change. All we need is the will, and a\r\n\
    decision to convene a round-table, with media representatives, relevant\r\n\
    government departments, disaster relief organizations and trauma\r\n\
    experts, to develop guidelines for reporting on disasters and strategies\r\n\
    for getting the media to adhere to such rules in their day-to-day work.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    There are precedents for such an approach. Several years ago, concerns\r\n\
    surfaced about the risks posed to vulnerable members of the community by\r\n\
    careless media reporting of suicide. In response, a number of considered\r\n\
    and practical guidelines were developed to assist media organisations to\r\n\
    understand the potential for harm, and how their reporting could avoid\r\n\
    it. Many Australian journalists are exposed to the guidelines during\r\n\
    their training or when they first hit the newsroom and, by and large,\r\n\
    media organs honour them in the observance rather than the breech.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Disasters have terrible, but similar contours. We need a code of conduct\r\n\
    for reporting on such happenings that is ethical, relevant and workable.\r\n\
    That attempts to balance the media\xE2\x80\x99s obligations to inform people about\r\n\
    what goes on in their name and in their midst, against the risk of harm\r\n\
    that some sorts of reporting can cause to those at the epicenter of a\r\n\
    disaster, and those watching on."

    you oppose a mandatory filter on the net. Or so says Senator Stephen\n\
    Conroy and his allies in the Christian Right and Authoritarian Left.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy is\n\
    not alone in his use of this shameful argumentative tact. The Australian\n\
    Christian Lobby\xE2\x80\x99s Jim Wallace and Melbourne and Australian University\n\
    academic Clive Hamilton-who as head of the Australia Institute initiated\n\
    this latest moral panic about the internet-have embraced it, too.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Actually, those fighting the Government\xE2\x80\x99s attempt to become the first\n\
    western nation to impose a nation-wide filter to screen illegal and\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cinappropriate\xE2\x80\x9D material have motives that are both sensible and\n\
    upright. Such opponents include the 90% of people who told a recent\n\
    Newspoll that they were opposed to government censorship of the net, and\n\
    the close to 100,000 of Australians who have so far signed the GetUp!\n\
    petition to top the mandatory filter being imposed. Not to mention the\n\
    civil libertarians and groups representing internet providers and\n\
    librarians.</p>\n\n\
    <p>These Australians oppose the filter because it will do nothing to stop\n\
    child abuse, will both slow down and cock up the net, and because\n\
    censorship in a liberal democratic society &ndash; especially one lacking a\n\
    legally protected right to free speech &ndash; is not just wrong, but\n\
    dangerous.</p>\n\n\
    <p>IT experts agree that the filtering technology sought by the government\n\
    is complex, and the knowledge necessary to implement it elusive. Even if\n\
    it could be done, the Australian Federal Police recently told ABC\n\
    radio\xE2\x80\x99s Background Briefing, it won\xE2\x80\x99t stop child pornographers. They\n\
    migrated to peer-to-peer networks and file-transfer systems years\n\
    ago-technologies the proposed internet filter won\xE2\x80\x99t touch. The only\n\
    thing the filter will do is slow down the internet and make it less\n\

  content: "Fond of kiddy-fiddlers? A friend of the porn industry? You must be, if\r\n\
    you oppose a mandatory filter on the net. Or so says Senator Stephen\r\n\
    Conroy and his allies in the Christian Right and Authoritarian Left.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy is\r\n\
    not alone in his use of this shameful argumentative tact. The Australian\r\n\
    Christian Lobby\xE2\x80\x99s Jim Wallace and Melbourne and Australian University\r\n\
    academic Clive Hamilton-who as head of the Australia Institute initiated\r\n\
    this latest moral panic about the internet-have embraced it, too.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Actually, those fighting the Government\xE2\x80\x99s attempt to become the first\r\n\
    western nation to impose a nation-wide filter to screen illegal and\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cinappropriate\xE2\x80\x9D material have motives that are both sensible and\r\n\
    upright. Such opponents include the 90% of people who told a recent\r\n\
    Newspoll that they were opposed to government censorship of the net, and\r\n\
    the close to 100,000 of Australians who have so far signed the GetUp!\r\n\
    petition to top the mandatory filter being imposed. Not to mention the\r\n\
    civil libertarians and groups representing internet providers and\r\n\
    librarians.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    These Australians oppose the filter because it will do nothing to stop\r\n\
    child abuse, will both slow down and cock up the net, and because\r\n\
    censorship in a liberal democratic society - especially one lacking a\r\n\
    legally protected right to free speech - is not just wrong, but\r\n\
    dangerous.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    IT experts agree that the filtering technology sought by the government\r\n\
    is complex, and the knowledge necessary to implement it elusive. Even if\r\n\
    it could be done, the Australian Federal Police recently told ABC\r\n\
    radio\xE2\x80\x99s Background Briefing, it won\xE2\x80\x99t stop child pornographers. They\r\n\
    migrated to peer-to-peer networks and file-transfer systems years\r\n\
    ago-technologies the proposed internet filter won\xE2\x80\x99t touch. The only\r\n\
    thing the filter will do is slow down the internet and make it less\r\n\
    useful and more costly for the rest of us.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This is old news. In 2004 the Howard government, initially enthusiastic\r\n\
    about a filter, rejected it for this reason, in favour of a website\r\n\
    offering advice and voluntary filters that parents could voluntarily\r\n\
    download. It is also why some Coalition senators-even conservative\r\n\
    Christians like Nick Minchin and Cory Bernardi-are now wary of it. That,\r\n\
    and the fact that the government agency compiling the list for voluntary\r\n\
    filters recently added a pro-life website with graphic images of fetuses\r\n\
    to the 1300 urls or web pages currently banned. This could go to 10,000\r\n\
    sites if the Government has its way. The banned list is not reviewable,\r\n\
    and its contents secret, and not subject to FOI requests.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    If mandatory filtering is not about stopping child abuse, what is the\r\n\
    aim of those spruiking the Great Australian firewall?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The answer seems to be what those on the far left and right of politics\r\n\

  content_markup: "<p>Australian publishing is a success story. In contrast to the uneven\n\
    product of the heavily subsidized film industry, publishing continues to\n\

    one that affects us all.</p>\n\n\

    <p>This is why Australian writers wrote to the Commission to plead for\n\

    off their work. No wonder the Commission\xE2\x80\x99s proposed changes are scaring\n\
    writers to death. Said one, who estimates that changes to the law will\n\
    reduce her Australian-made income by two-thirds: \xE2\x80\x9CThe money I make\n\

    equity and inclusion and fight for the resources required to give all\r\n\
    Aussie kids a quality education deserve our praise. Those that don\xE2\x80\x99t\r\n\
    must hear us roar, and believe us when we say we won\xE2\x80\x99t go away."

    met to discuss the ways a marriage in this country could be dissolved\n\
    using a process called collaborative family law.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Founded in the USA twenty years ago, collaborative family law involves\n\
    separating couples and their lawyers sitting around a table and openly\n\
    and honestly discussing the range of matters of importance to them,\n\

    settlement that best addresses their individual needs, interests and\n\
    goals.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Negotiations are conducted courteously and in good faith, with both\n\
    parties bound to disclose all pertinent information and material fact,\n\

    couple go to court, both collaborative lawyers are effectively sacked,\n\
    because before collaboration starts they sign an agreement disqualifying\n\
    them from litigating if it fails.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But what really makes collaborative law a winner is the space the\n\
    process makes for shared experts that are hired by both parties, and\n\

    <p>Foremost among these is the child consultant, who meets with each of the\n\
    couple\xE2\x80\x99s children in order to bring their experience and needs to the\n\
    negotiating table. The goal is for both spouses to comprehend their\n\
    children\xE2\x80\x99s experience of conflict and their post-divorce requirements in\n\
    a deep and transformative way. The resulting wake-up call can lead\n\
    parents to change their attitude to their former partner and they way\n\
    they act around their kids, and to negotiate parenting arrangements that\n\

    <p>I am the child of divorce. My parents separated in the early 1970s when\n\

    to let my brother move in with my Dad. They rowed in person and over the\n\
    phone until I left home for University at age eighteen.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Around 12 per cent of children in intact families experience mental\n\
    health problems in childhood. This figure rises to 25 per cent for\n\
    children of divorce. Children need their parents to tune into their\n\
    needs when divorce happens, and to be emotionally available to them.\n\
    Conflict, which turns to acrimony as the years progress, gets in the way\n\
    of that happening, This is why the children of conflicted and litigated\n\
    divorces have the worst mental health outcomes of all.</p>\n\n\
    <p>A 2006 Australian study found that one third of children whose parents\n\
    reported high levels of conflict had psychological disturbance at\n\
    clinical levels. Other studies show they are more likely to leave school\n\

    parents.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\

  updated_on: 2011-03-24 18:08:41
  content_markup: "<p>Tuned into the boat-people debate this week? If yes, you\xE2\x80\x99ll know that\n\
    the stress and disagreement that has long characterized the debate about\n\
    migration is over. We all agree now that it\xE2\x80\x99s the people-smugglers we\n\
    love to hate. People smugglers, the PM said, are \xE2\x80\x9Cthe absolute scum of\n\
    the earth.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Australians disagree about migration. We always have. Since the 1960s,\n\
    opinion polls have shown those with more education support higher levels\n\
    of migration than those with a trade qualification or high-school\n\
    degree. A 2003 a national survey by the ANU found 41 per cent of\n\
    university graduates thought immigration should be increased. Only 17\n\
    per cent of those with a trade qualifications or a high-school education\n\
    agreed.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Only a few years ago, such disagreements were significant enough to\n\
    swing an election. The Howard government leveraged them as part of the\n\
    culture wars. The left aided such divisive efforts by implying that\n\
    migration skeptics were not just wrong, but morally suspect.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The truth is that Australians have real disagreements not just about\n\
    boat people, but our entire approach to population, including policies\n\
    on fertility and migration. While there will always be a portion of\n\
    Hanson sympathizers among migration skeptics, most are not racist and\n\
    react angrily at suggestions they are.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I migrated to Australia twenty years ago. I was born in the States,\n\
    where my great-grandparents migrated from Eastern Europe to escape the\n\
    pogroms. I feel compassion for those who give up their language, culture\n\
    and families to leave their homes to seek a safer and better life in\n\
    Australia. I know how hard new migrants work, how much contribute to\n\
    their new homeland, and how fiercely loyal they can be to the country\n\
    that grants them refuge and the chance to give their kids a better life.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But I\xE2\x80\x99ve also done enough traveling to know that we are on a good wicket\n\
    in the west, including here in Australia. You don\xE2\x80\x99t have to be too flash\n\
    at math to know that if too many come to this country too quickly, the\n\
    quality of life for those already here could be put at risk.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It\xE2\x80\x99s a dilemma, and one that joining forces to snipe about those nasty\n\
    people-smugglers will do nothing to resolve. Should we want to calm the\n\
    waters around this issue-really calm the waters-we need to stop\n\
    pretending the handful of boats that arrive each year are the problem,\n\
    and stopping people smugglers the solution.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Instead, we need to give the public greater opportunity to contribute in\n\
    a calm and reasoned way to shaping our national outlook on fertility and\n\
    migration.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It may be the lack of a legitimate opportunity to contribute to\n\
    population policy that sees the electorate over-react each time an\n\
    un-seaworthy boat reaches our shores. Despite history showing that at\n\
    least 90 per cent of those on board are likely to be legitimate\n\
    refugees, the boats remind us of how unsettled we feel about all aspects\n\
    of population policy. Because the boats get the get the attention of the\n\
    media and the politicians, they provide the chance &ndash; through talkback\n\
    and the letters pages &ndash; to express concern about the whole issue.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Federal Government has not inquired into population policy since the\n\
    start of the 1990s. It\xE2\x80\x99s high time this changed.</p>\n\n\
    <p>We need to put the real issues on the table and to debate them, fair and\n\
    square.</p>\n"

    and families to leave their homes to seek a safer and better life in\r\n\
    Australia. I know how hard new migrants work, how much contribute to\r\n\
    their new homeland, and how fiercely loyal they can be to the country\r\n\
    that grants them refuge and the chance to give their kids a better life.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But I\xE2\x80\x99ve also done enough traveling to know that we are on a good wicket\r\n\
    in the west, including here in Australia. You don\xE2\x80\x99t have to be too flash\r\n\
    at math to know that if too many come to this country too quickly, the\r\n\
    quality of life for those already here could be put at risk.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It\xE2\x80\x99s a dilemma, and one that joining forces to snipe about those nasty\r\n\
    people-smugglers will do nothing to resolve. Should we want to calm the\r\n\
    waters around this issue-really calm the waters-we need to stop\r\n\
    pretending the handful of boats that arrive each year are the problem,\r\n\
    and stopping people smugglers the solution.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Instead, we need to give the public greater opportunity to contribute in\r\n\
    a calm and reasoned way to shaping our national outlook on fertility and\r\n\
    migration.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It may be the lack of a legitimate opportunity to contribute to\r\n\
    population policy that sees the electorate over-react each time an\r\n\
    un-seaworthy boat reaches our shores. Despite history showing that at\r\n\
    least 90 per cent of those on board are likely to be legitimate\r\n\
    refugees, the boats remind us of how unsettled we feel about all aspects\r\n\
    of population policy. Because the boats get the get the attention of the\r\n\
    media and the politicians, they provide the chance - through talkback\r\n\
    and the letters pages - to express concern about the whole issue.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The Federal Government has not inquired into population policy since the\r\n\
    start of the 1990s. It\xE2\x80\x99s high time this changed.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    We need to put the real issues on the table and to debate them, fair and\r\n\
    square."

    low, and far too many free permits to pollute will be handed out. A cap\n\

    polluters to pay. Yet the Rudd scheme is all about rewarding precisely\n\

    cheapest and most efficient way of getting business to change its ways\n\
    for the good of the environment. History shows that, once in place,\n\

  updated_on: 2011-03-24 18:08:27
  content_markup: "<p>The Mother\xE2\x80\x99s Day press release was cloying. The innovation it heralds is\n\
    unnecessary at best and, at worst, a sexist menace.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The product is IntelliGender, a $95 urine test that claims to identify\n\
    the sex of a foetus from as early as eight weeks. It went on sale last\n\
    Sunday at some Australian chemists.</p>\n\n\
    <p>IntelliGender\xE2\x80\x99s tag line is, \xE2\x80\x9CPink or blue, we\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you!\xE2\x80\x9D It\xE2\x80\x99s here\n\
    the problems start. Already, experts have raised doubts about the test\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    capacity to reliably discern foetal sex. No reports on the science\n\
    behind it have appeared in the academic literature and even the company\n\
    admits that the 90 per cent accuracy achieved in clinical tests falls to\n\
    82 per cent in real-world conditions.</p>\n\n\
    <p>How much this matters has everything to do with the real-world uses to\n\
    which the test is put. If few buy it, and those that do see it as no\n\
    more than a bit of fun designed to get those nursery colour coordinates\n\
    right, then who cares? But the worry is that in Australia, where\n\
    abortion is a safe if not always lawful procedure, test results might\n\
    not be accurate, yet become the basis of a decision with legal, medical\n\
    and ethical ramifications. This is different to home pregnancy tests,\n\
    the results of which are always validated prior to an abortion being\n\
    undertaken or antenatal care commenced.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But the core ethical concerns raised by DIY sex-identification kits are\n\
    about more than informed decision-making. They take in the motives of\n\
    users and the consequences for all of us if skewed gender preferences\n\
    are given free reign.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Currently, the only way Australians can select their child\xE2\x80\x99s gender is\n\
    to create embryos using IVF, then screen for sex prior to implantation.\n\
    In most Australian states, this technology can only be offered to\n\
    couples seeking to avoid the birth of a child with an inherited\n\
    gender-linked disease such as haemophilia. Where the law is silent,\n\
    medical research and ethics guidelines &ndash; which tend to frown on use of\n\
    the technology for non-medical reasons &ndash; reign. In the past, there was a\n\
    NSW clinic that offered embryo screening for medical reasons and to\n\
    those seeking to balance their family by having a child of a sex\n\
    different to their existing children but this service has now been\n\
    withdrawn.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The lack of outcry about such restrictions seems best explained by low\n\
    levels of desire to select gender for reasons other than avoiding\n\
    disease or family balancing.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The best predictor of couples who will try for a third child are those\n\
    with two children of the same sex, and surveys of Anglo and European\n\
    couples &ndash; Australian data is scarce &ndash; show low levels of interest in\n\
    using gender-selection technology. This is as it should be. Parents\n\
    should not have a general preference for one sex over the other\n\
    validated, nor be allowed to turn such preferences into a skewed gender\n\
    reality (most likely, a world in which more boys are born than girls).\n\
    Gender selection using IVF to avoid disease or balance genders in a\n\
    family doesn\xE2\x80\x99t do this. Also, by compelling couples to turn up at\n\
    clinics to access the technology, it makes possible the sort of\n\
    monitoring that would reveal straight away if couples were choosing more\n\
    of one sex than the other.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Home-based testing kits for foetal sex undercut informed\n\
    decision-making, trivialise gender-based childbearing decisions and\n\
    render their consequences &ndash; should the use of the test followed by\n\
    abortion become widespread &ndash; difficult to monitor.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It\xE2\x80\x99s hard to see reasons to have them on pharmacy shelves.</p>\n"

    The product is IntelliGender, a $95 urine test that claims to identify\r\n\
    the sex of a foetus from as early as eight weeks. It went on sale last\r\n\
    Sunday at some Australian chemists.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    IntelliGender\xE2\x80\x99s tag line is, \xE2\x80\x9CPink or blue, we\xE2\x80\x99ll tell you!\xE2\x80\x9D It\xE2\x80\x99s here\r\n\
    the problems start. Already, experts have raised doubts about the test\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    capacity to reliably discern foetal sex. No reports on the science\r\n\
    behind it have appeared in the academic literature and even the company\r\n\
    admits that the 90 per cent accuracy achieved in clinical tests falls to\r\n\
    82 per cent in real-world conditions.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    How much this matters has everything to do with the real-world uses to\r\n\
    which the test is put. If few buy it, and those that do see it as no\r\n\
    more than a bit of fun designed to get those nursery colour coordinates\r\n\
    right, then who cares? But the worry is that in Australia, where\r\n\
    abortion is a safe if not always lawful procedure, test results might\r\n\
    not be accurate, yet become the basis of a decision with legal, medical\r\n\
    and ethical ramifications. This is different to home pregnancy tests,\r\n\
    the results of which are always validated prior to an abortion being\r\n\
    undertaken or antenatal care commenced.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But the core ethical concerns raised by DIY sex-identification kits are\r\n\
    about more than informed decision-making. They take in the motives of\r\n\
    users and the consequences for all of us if skewed gender preferences\r\n\
    are given free reign.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Currently, the only way Australians can select their child\xE2\x80\x99s gender is\r\n\
    to create embryos using IVF, then screen for sex prior to implantation.\r\n\
    In most Australian states, this technology can only be offered to\r\n\
    couples seeking to avoid the birth of a child with an inherited\r\n\
    gender-linked disease such as haemophilia. Where the law is silent,\r\n\
    medical research and ethics guidelines - which tend to frown on use of\r\n\
    the technology for non-medical reasons - reign. In the past, there was a\r\n\
    NSW clinic that offered embryo screening for medical reasons and to\r\n\
    those seeking to balance their family by having a child of a sex\r\n\
    different to their existing children but this service has now been\r\n\
    withdrawn.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The lack of outcry about such restrictions seems best explained by low\r\n\
    levels of desire to select gender for reasons other than avoiding\r\n\
    disease or family balancing.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The best predictor of couples who will try for a third child are those\r\n\
    with two children of the same sex, and surveys of Anglo and European\r\n\
    couples - Australian data is scarce - show low levels of interest in\r\n\
    using gender-selection technology. This is as it should be. Parents\r\n\
    should not have a general preference for one sex over the other\r\n\
    validated, nor be allowed to turn such preferences into a skewed gender\r\n\
    reality (most likely, a world in which more boys are born than girls).\r\n\
    Gender selection using IVF to avoid disease or balance genders in a\r\n\
    family doesn\xE2\x80\x99t do this. Also, by compelling couples to turn up at\r\n\
    clinics to access the technology, it makes possible the sort of\r\n\
    monitoring that would reveal straight away if couples were choosing more\r\n\
    of one sex than the other.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Home-based testing kits for foetal sex undercut informed\r\n\
    decision-making, trivialise gender-based childbearing decisions and\r\n\
    render their consequences - should the use of the test followed by\r\n\
    abortion become widespread - difficult to monitor.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It\xE2\x80\x99s hard to see reasons to have them on pharmacy shelves."

  content_markup: "<p>\xE2\x80\x9CI was upset by what happened. In fact I don\xE2\x80\x99t think I\xE2\x80\x99ve ever felt so\n\
    humiliated in my life . . I understand that the president made a ruling\n\
    based on the current rules. But as any mother knows, sometimes families\n\
    don\xE2\x80\x99t play by the rule book \xE2\x80\xA6 I hope this allows us to have a discussion\n\
    about how we balance these things and respect the work of working\n\
    families regardless of whether it\xE2\x80\x99s mothers or fathers \xE2\x80\xA6\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>These are the words of freshman Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young,\n\
    describing Thursday\xE2\x80\x99s decision by Senate president John Hogg to evict\n\
    her two-year-old daughter, Kora, from the chamber. The baby was a\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cstranger in the house\xE2\x80\x9D and, by Hogg\xE2\x80\x99s interpretation of ancient\n\
    standing orders, not allowed to be present during voting.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Hanson-Young was still upset when she made her comments, which may\n\
    account for their rawness and revelatory nature. I was intrigued by her\n\
    use of the word humiliation to describe how she felt, and gratified by\n\
    her recognition of fathers as among the parents wanting a reasonable\n\
    balance between work and life.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Humiliation is the loss of pride that brings one low or compels one to\n\
    submit. It can be brought about through bullying, intimidation, physical\n\
    or mental mistreatment, or by embarrassment if a person is presented as\n\
    having committed a socially or legally unacceptable act.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Humiliation, and its kissing cousin shame, play significant roles in\n\
    shaping women\xE2\x80\x99s experience of reproduction and motherhood.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I was reminded of this recently by a friend who supported her\n\
    18-year-old daughter through a second trimester abortion. For my friend,\n\
    both her daughter\xE2\x80\x99s denial of the reality of her pregnancy and the\n\
    postures adopted by all the young women at the clinic, were portraits in\n\
    female humiliation and shame.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I wasn\xE2\x80\x99t sure I understood. \xE2\x80\x9CHad the doctors said anything to the women?\n\
    Or the medicos they\xE2\x80\x99d encountered before getting to the clinic?\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CNo, Leslie,\xE2\x80\x9D my friend replied. &ldquo;The shame was about being female. They\n\
    weren\xE2\x80\x99t supposed to be pregnant when they didn\xE2\x80\x99t want to be, and then\n\

  content: "\xE2\x80\x9CI was upset by what happened. In fact I don\xE2\x80\x99t think I\xE2\x80\x99ve ever felt so\r\n\
    humiliated in my life . . I understand that the president made a ruling\r\n\
    based on the current rules. But as any mother knows, sometimes families\r\n\
    don\xE2\x80\x99t play by the rule book \xE2\x80\xA6 I hope this allows us to have a discussion\r\n\
    about how we balance these things and respect the work of working\r\n\
    families regardless of whether it\xE2\x80\x99s mothers or fathers \xE2\x80\xA6\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    These are the words of freshman Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young,\r\n\
    describing Thursday\xE2\x80\x99s decision by Senate president John Hogg to evict\r\n\
    her two-year-old daughter, Kora, from the chamber. The baby was a\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cstranger in the house\xE2\x80\x9D and, by Hogg\xE2\x80\x99s interpretation of ancient\r\n\
    standing orders, not allowed to be present during voting.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Hanson-Young was still upset when she made her comments, which may\r\n\
    account for their rawness and revelatory nature. I was intrigued by her\r\n\
    use of the word humiliation to describe how she felt, and gratified by\r\n\
    her recognition of fathers as among the parents wanting a reasonable\r\n\
    balance between work and life.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Humiliation is the loss of pride that brings one low or compels one to\r\n\
    submit. It can be brought about through bullying, intimidation, physical\r\n\
    or mental mistreatment, or by embarrassment if a person is presented as\r\n\
    having committed a socially or legally unacceptable act.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Humiliation, and its kissing cousin shame, play significant roles in\r\n\
    shaping women\xE2\x80\x99s experience of reproduction and motherhood.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I was reminded of this recently by a friend who supported her\r\n\
    18-year-old daughter through a second trimester abortion. For my friend,\r\n\
    both her daughter\xE2\x80\x99s denial of the reality of her pregnancy and the\r\n\
    postures adopted by all the young women at the clinic, were portraits in\r\n\
    female humiliation and shame.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I wasn\xE2\x80\x99t sure I understood. \xE2\x80\x9CHad the doctors said anything to the women?\r\n\
    Or the medicos they\xE2\x80\x99d encountered before getting to the clinic?\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CNo, Leslie,\xE2\x80\x9D my friend replied. \"The shame was about being female. They\r\n\
    weren\xE2\x80\x99t supposed to be pregnant when they didn\xE2\x80\x99t want to be, and then\r\n\
    they were cramped and bleeding and leaking milk.\r\n\

  title: Gene Patents Violate Civil Liberties
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 18:07:51
  content_markup: "<p>There\xE2\x80\x99s a question that\xE2\x80\x99s been around for about 30 years: whether\n\
    private, for-profit companies should be allowed to gain exclusive\n\
    control over knowledge about our genes.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Should private interests profit from their understanding of the human\n\
    genetic code or from tests or cures they may &ndash; or may not &ndash; be willing\n\
    or are able to derive from this knowledge? Is such control, encouraged\n\
    by research funding arrangements and facilitated by patent law, the best\n\
    way to serve the public good and public health?</p>\n\n\
    <p>The American Civil Liberties Union says \xE2\x80\x9Cno\xE2\x80\x9D. Last month the union\n\
    launched a court action on behalf of scientific and women\xE2\x80\x99s health\n\
    groups and individual women at increased risk of hereditary cancers. The\n\
    action challenges the patents on two genes held by a company called\n\
    Myriad. The genes are linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and\n\
    the patent grants Myriad exclusive rights to control and profit from the\n\
    testing of women with a family history of such cancer, to conduct\n\
    further research on the gene and to control and profit from therapies\n\
    that might result from the research.</p>\n\n\
    <p>If the union wins, it\xE2\x80\x99s not just the patent on Myriad\xE2\x80\x99s genes that may\n\
    be rendered invalid but the tens of thousands of other patents on human\n\
    genes, too.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Luigi Palombi, a patent lawyer recently interviewed on the ABC\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    Background Briefing, thinks this is fair enough. According to Palombi,\n\
    private companies should never have been allowed to patent genes in the\n\
    first place. Not only are such patents unfair (Myriad only identified\n\
    fragments, but was granted control of the entire gene), but they violate\n\
    the legal prohibition on patenting abstract ideas or the laws and\n\
    products of nature. Patents are ineffective and inefficient, reducing\n\
    the competition and co-operative endeavour needed to understand and\n\
    exploit genes for human health and limiting women\xE2\x80\x99s options regarding\n\
    their medical care. Palombi says that instead of complaining about the\n\
    potential loss of their genomic patents, the companies that currently\n\
    hold patents should be grateful. They always knew they were stretching\n\
    the limits of patent law, and the fact that they\xE2\x80\x99ve been getting away\n\
    with it for 20 years means \xE2\x80\x9Cthey\xE2\x80\x99ve received an advantage that, frankly,\n\
    they were not entitled to receive\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In 2004, the Australian Law Reform Commission completed an 18-month\n\
    inquiry into intellectual property rights over genetic materials and\n\
    related technologies, though its recommendations have yet to be\n\
    implemented. The Senate community affairs committee just finished taking\n\
    submissions on the wisdom of granting patents in Australia over genes\n\
    and their products, with public hearings to commence shortly.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The main problem for those hoping to wrest control of the human genome\n\
    from the profit-seekers is to counter the self-interested claim by\n\
    biotechs and big pharmaceutical companies that they are the only ones\n\
    who can do the research and development needed to unearth the secrets of\n\
    the genome. Such companies argue that in exchange for their contribution\n\
    to human health, we owe them proprietary control and profits.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This is unadulterated rubbish. Patenting is just one component of a\n\
    framework for facilitating scientific and medical innovation.</p>\n\n\

  content: "There\xE2\x80\x99s a question that\xE2\x80\x99s been around for about 30 years: whether\r\n\
    private, for-profit companies should be allowed to gain exclusive\r\n\
    control over knowledge about our genes.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Should private interests profit from their understanding of the human\r\n\
    genetic code or from tests or cures they may - or may not - be willing\r\n\
    or are able to derive from this knowledge? Is such control, encouraged\r\n\
    by research funding arrangements and facilitated by patent law, the best\r\n\
    way to serve the public good and public health?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The American Civil Liberties Union says \xE2\x80\x9Cno\xE2\x80\x9D. Last month the union\r\n\
    launched a court action on behalf of scientific and women\xE2\x80\x99s health\r\n\
    groups and individual women at increased risk of hereditary cancers. The\r\n\
    action challenges the patents on two genes held by a company called\r\n\
    Myriad. The genes are linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and\r\n\
    the patent grants Myriad exclusive rights to control and profit from the\r\n\
    testing of women with a family history of such cancer, to conduct\r\n\
    further research on the gene and to control and profit from therapies\r\n\
    that might result from the research.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    If the union wins, it\xE2\x80\x99s not just the patent on Myriad\xE2\x80\x99s genes that may\r\n\
    be rendered invalid but the tens of thousands of other patents on human\r\n\
    genes, too.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Luigi Palombi, a patent lawyer recently interviewed on the ABC\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    Background Briefing, thinks this is fair enough. According to Palombi,\r\n\
    private companies should never have been allowed to patent genes in the\r\n\
    first place. Not only are such patents unfair (Myriad only identified\r\n\
    fragments, but was granted control of the entire gene), but they violate\r\n\
    the legal prohibition on patenting abstract ideas or the laws and\r\n\
    products of nature. Patents are ineffective and inefficient, reducing\r\n\
    the competition and co-operative endeavour needed to understand and\r\n\
    exploit genes for human health and limiting women\xE2\x80\x99s options regarding\r\n\
    their medical care. Palombi says that instead of complaining about the\r\n\
    potential loss of their genomic patents, the companies that currently\r\n\
    hold patents should be grateful. They always knew they were stretching\r\n\
    the limits of patent law, and the fact that they\xE2\x80\x99ve been getting away\r\n\
    with it for 20 years means \xE2\x80\x9Cthey\xE2\x80\x99ve received an advantage that, frankly,\r\n\
    they were not entitled to receive\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In 2004, the Australian Law Reform Commission completed an 18-month\r\n\
    inquiry into intellectual property rights over genetic materials and\r\n\
    related technologies, though its recommendations have yet to be\r\n\
    implemented. The Senate community affairs committee just finished taking\r\n\
    submissions on the wisdom of granting patents in Australia over genes\r\n\
    and their products, with public hearings to commence shortly.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The main problem for those hoping to wrest control of the human genome\r\n\
    from the profit-seekers is to counter the self-interested claim by\r\n\
    biotechs and big pharmaceutical companies that they are the only ones\r\n\
    who can do the research and development needed to unearth the secrets of\r\n\
    the genome. Such companies argue that in exchange for their contribution\r\n\
    to human health, we owe them proprietary control and profits.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This is unadulterated rubbish. Patenting is just one component of a\r\n\
    framework for facilitating scientific and medical innovation.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The union case is about rejecting patents as neither the best nor the\r\n\
    right way to promote and protect genetic knowledge and innovation. It is\r\n\
    not too late to unscramble the egg."

  content_markup: "<p>Years ago, when I was doing a Masters of Bioethics under renowned\n\
    philosopher Peter Singer at Monash University in Melbourne, I signed up\n\
    to the newly founded Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The donation of bone marrow is not a simple or pain-free procedure, but\n\
    I was young and single and surrounded by people absorbed with doing the\n\
    right thing. At the time I was vegetarian and caring for a young man\n\
    dying of HIV/AIDS. Offering a gift of life to someone with leukaemia or\n\
    other fatal blood disorders without so much as a backwards glance was\n\
    what I wanted to be &ndash; and thought I was &ndash; all about.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Fast forward a few years and I had become a mother, teething baby in one\n\
    arm and a toddler under the other. Undone as much by overwork and lack\n\
    of sleep as by the guilt of the working mother enterprise (these were\n\
    the Howard years, remember?), the call came one afternoon. It was from\n\
    the registry. A woman in another state in Australia was sick and needed\n\
    a bone marrow transplant, but none of her siblings was a tissue match.\n\
    Initial tests of my blood suggested I might be able to help.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Back then &ndash; this was before 2001 &ndash; there was only one way to get bone\n\
    marrow (today, this method has been joined by another, which has its own\n\
    risk profile). I would have to go into hospital and have a general\n\
    anaesthetic so doctors could extract the required cells from my pelvic\n\
    bones using hollow needles. Afterwards there would be bruises, pain and\n\
    stiffness.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I would need pain relief and would have trouble walking (one woman\n\
    described it like being kicked by a horse). If I was truly unlucky, the\n\
    rare risks associated with general anaesthesia, transfusion and\n\
    infection or injury at the needle site might come into play.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I\xE2\x80\x99ll be perfectly honest. I did not want to do it. I absolutely did not\n\
    want to do it. At that point in my life, I needed the risks and\n\
    complications of tissue donation like a hole in the head.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Normally, when a person accepts the costs of a medical procedure it is\n\
    because she sees them as favourably offset by its benefits &ndash; to her. For\n\
    live tissue donors the equation is different. Donating bone marrow\n\
    required me to assume both the certain complications and unknown risks\n\
    of the procedure to benefit someone else &ndash; a person I did not know.</p>\n\n\
    <p>As it turned out, I never had to choose. Additional tests revealed I was\n\
    not compatible and so the registry\xE2\x80\x99s search for a donor moved on. Or so\n\
    I presumed. For privacy and practical reasons, I could never find out\n\
    what happened to the woman and whether a tissue-matched donor was ever\n\
    found.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So what if someone from the Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry rang\n\
    me today?</p>\n\n\
    <p>They might because, despite the anguish and uncertainty I suffered so\n\
    many years back, I ultimately decided not to take my name off the\n\
    database.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This was not just because I knew my kids would likely be older and less\n\
    dependent when the phone rang again, but because, however inconvenient\n\
    and unpleasant it might be, giving marrow to a stranger is the right\n\
    thing to do.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Indeed, it is the absence of the usual emotional pulls to gift-giving &ndash;\n\
    love, friendship, social obligation &ndash; that make live, anonymous tissue\n\

    <p>Crane took us all for a ride. Now 83, he claimed he was Australia\xE2\x80\x99s\n\

    war historians and returned servicemen, have used words like galled,\n\
    disgusted and appalled. The Australian Federal Police are now pursuing\n\
    Crane-who has received the top pension award, a $25,000 bonus payment\n\
    and a Commonwealth Gold Card covering all medical expenses-for fraud.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Crane\xE2\x80\x99s story is one of betrayal. \xE2\x80\x9CNo Judas, no story,\xE2\x80\x9D says writer and\n\

    <p>Odd then, that we find it so hard to define both act and emotion with\n\
    depth and precision. Disloyalty and treachery is the best the dictionary\n\

    determine the cost to victims.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Betrayal is an assault on trust. Rex Crane\xE2\x80\x99s lies about his wartime\n\
    activities betrayed the most fundamental trust we offer those we love,\n\
    live with, befriend and admire-what we must offer if such a thing as a\n\
    relationship is to exist. An automatic, unquestioning faith that people\n\
    are who they claim to be. While publicly disowning him, as his step\n\
    granddaughter has done, may alleviate the guilt and shame society\n\
    unfairly heaps on those associated with wrongdoers by blood or marriage,\n\
    those closest to Crane may require professional support. How else to\n\
    ensure the anger they must feel is directed out towards him, rather than\n\
    in on themselves, eroding confidence in their character judgment or\n\
    morphing into depression.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Society must walk a similarly fine line. Veteran\xE2\x80\x99s affairs Minister Alan\n\

  updated_on: 2011-03-24 18:07:18
  content_markup: "<p>Even if we eliminate people smugglers, the people needing smuggling\n\
    won\xE2\x80\x99t disappear.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Kevin Rudd has an unnerving resemblance to Alfred E. Neuman, the\n\
    gormless cover boy of <em>Mad</em> magazine. Periodically offered for higher\n\
    office, Neuman\xE2\x80\x99s election slogan is always the same. \xE2\x80\x9CYou could do worse\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA6 and always have.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>This week about 260 Sri Lankans, including 27 women and 31 children, are\n\
    docked in western Java. They were seeking asylum in Australia, and are\n\
    now refusing to leave their boat after being intercepted &ndash; at Rudd\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    request &ndash; by the Indonesian navy. These people, and another 75 fleeing\n\
    the brutal civil conflict in Sri Lanka who remain at sea in\n\
    international waters, would have featured large in the Prime Minister\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    discussion with his Indonesian counterpart in Jakarta last Tuesday.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I\xE2\x80\x99ve written about boat people and stand by my view that community\n\
    anxiety about such asylum seekers (only 3 per cent of those who seek\n\
    refuge in Australia) is a proxy for the frustration many Australians\n\
    feel about the refusal of successive governments to develop a national\n\
    population policy.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But knowing why hysteria ensues each time a leaky vessel enters\n\
    Australian territorial waters doesn\xE2\x80\x99t tell us how we should respond to\n\
    the men, women and children on board seeking our protection and whom\n\
    history suggests will overwhelmingly be found to be genuine refugees.</p>\n\n\
    <p>We all know what\xE2\x80\x99s right. We know in the same way we know that if a\n\
    young, scared-looking woman pounded on our door in the middle of the\n\
    night seeking refuge from some unseen persecutor, that we must let her\n\
    in. Refusing to open the door &ndash; or, having seen her approach through the\n\
    blinds, unleashing the dog to drive her from the gate and into the arms\n\
    of our none-too-savoury neighbour &ndash; doesn\xE2\x80\x99t absolve us of a duty to\n\
    help. It simply adds \xE2\x80\x9Cweasel\xE2\x80\x9D to the charge sheet.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Yet, in policy terms, this is what federal Labor is doing. This year,\n\
    the Government has allocated $654 million to what it loftily describes\n\
    as a \xE2\x80\x9Ccomprehensive, whole-of-government\xE2\x80\x9D approach to \xE2\x80\x9Ccombat[ing]\n\
    people smugglers\xE2\x80\x9D. We need to stop kidding ourselves. Even if we\n\
    eliminate people smugglers, the people needing smuggling won\xE2\x80\x99t\n\
    disappear. Just because people don\xE2\x80\x99t suffer on our patch doesn\xE2\x80\x99t mean\n\
    they aren\xE2\x80\x99t suffering.</p>\n\n\
    <p>And anyone who thinks our Indonesian \xE2\x80\x9Cfriends\xE2\x80\x9D are not exploiting this\n\
    Government\xE2\x80\x99s determination to do whatever it takes to deny less than 300\n\
    people on-shore processing of their asylum claims needs to consult the\n\
    dictionary definition of realpolitik.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The international convention on refugees was developed in response to\n\
    the outflow of Jews from Europe after World War II and in light of the\n\
    deaths of a third of the 937 men, women and children who embarked on\n\
    what a later Hollywood movie would call the Voyage of the Damned. Having\n\
    fled Nazi persecution in 1939, the SS St Louis was forced back to Europe\n\
    after being denied entry to Canada, the US and Cuba.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Australia signed the refugee convention in the 1950s but if we can\xE2\x80\x99t\n\
    honour our obligations, we should have the decency to formally withdraw.\n\
    Better still, we could elect federal politicians with the will and\n\
    capacity to lead, rather than grovel to the lowest common denominator.\n\
    The Prime Minister still has the moral authority &ndash; not to mention the\n\
    electoral margin &ndash; to open a new policy and rhetorical chapter on asylum\n\
    seekers and population issues more generally.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Should he fail to do so, Australia\xE2\x80\x99s policies on refugees will remain\n\
    just as Alfred E. Neuman said: \xE2\x80\x9CLike steer horns. A point here, a point\n\
    there and a lot of bull in between.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n"

    docked in western Java. They were seeking asylum in Australia, and are\r\n\
    now refusing to leave their boat after being intercepted - at Rudd\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    request - by the Indonesian navy. These people, and another 75 fleeing\r\n\
    the brutal civil conflict in Sri Lanka who remain at sea in\r\n\
    international waters, would have featured large in the Prime Minister\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    discussion with his Indonesian counterpart in Jakarta last Tuesday.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I\xE2\x80\x99ve written about boat people and stand by my view that community\r\n\
    anxiety about such asylum seekers (only 3 per cent of those who seek\r\n\
    refuge in Australia) is a proxy for the frustration many Australians\r\n\
    feel about the refusal of successive governments to develop a national\r\n\
    population policy.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But knowing why hysteria ensues each time a leaky vessel enters\r\n\
    Australian territorial waters doesn\xE2\x80\x99t tell us how we should respond to\r\n\
    the men, women and children on board seeking our protection and whom\r\n\
    history suggests will overwhelmingly be found to be genuine refugees.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    We all know what\xE2\x80\x99s right. We know in the same way we know that if a\r\n\
    young, scared-looking woman pounded on our door in the middle of the\r\n\
    night seeking refuge from some unseen persecutor, that we must let her\r\n\
    in. Refusing to open the door - or, having seen her approach through the\r\n\
    blinds, unleashing the dog to drive her from the gate and into the arms\r\n\
    of our none-too-savoury neighbour - doesn\xE2\x80\x99t absolve us of a duty to\r\n\
    help. It simply adds \xE2\x80\x9Cweasel\xE2\x80\x9D to the charge sheet.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Yet, in policy terms, this is what federal Labor is doing. This year,\r\n\
    the Government has allocated $654 million to what it loftily describes\r\n\
    as a \xE2\x80\x9Ccomprehensive, whole-of-government\xE2\x80\x9D approach to \xE2\x80\x9Ccombat[ing]\r\n\
    people smugglers\xE2\x80\x9D. We need to stop kidding ourselves. Even if we\r\n\
    eliminate people smugglers, the people needing smuggling won\xE2\x80\x99t\r\n\
    disappear. Just because people don\xE2\x80\x99t suffer on our patch doesn\xE2\x80\x99t mean\r\n\
    they aren\xE2\x80\x99t suffering.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    And anyone who thinks our Indonesian \xE2\x80\x9Cfriends\xE2\x80\x9D are not exploiting this\r\n\
    Government\xE2\x80\x99s determination to do whatever it takes to deny less than 300\r\n\
    people on-shore processing of their asylum claims needs to consult the\r\n\
    dictionary definition of realpolitik.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The international convention on refugees was developed in response to\r\n\
    the outflow of Jews from Europe after World War II and in light of the\r\n\
    deaths of a third of the 937 men, women and children who embarked on\r\n\
    what a later Hollywood movie would call the Voyage of the Damned. Having\r\n\
    fled Nazi persecution in 1939, the SS St Louis was forced back to Europe\r\n\
    after being denied entry to Canada, the US and Cuba.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Australia signed the refugee convention in the 1950s but if we can\xE2\x80\x99t\r\n\
    honour our obligations, we should have the decency to formally withdraw.\r\n\
    Better still, we could elect federal politicians with the will and\r\n\
    capacity to lead, rather than grovel to the lowest common denominator.\r\n\
    The Prime Minister still has the moral authority - not to mention the\r\n\
    electoral margin - to open a new policy and rhetorical chapter on asylum\r\n\
    seekers and population issues more generally.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Should he fail to do so, Australia\xE2\x80\x99s policies on refugees will remain\r\n\
    just as Alfred E. Neuman said: \xE2\x80\x9CLike steer horns. A point here, a point\r\n\
    there and a lot of bull in between.\xE2\x80\x9D"

    <p>There is no room at the Women\xE2\x80\x99s. Once the hospital saw its mission as\n\
    the service of all the Victorian women. Now, women inquiring about\n\
    having their baby there will be asked their postcode. Should they fall\n\

    <p>Poor government policy and planning, an upward blip in the fertility\n\
    rate and Victoria\xE2\x80\x99s burgeoning population has seen births jump 12 per\n\
    cent in Victoria over a three year period, but the number of maternity\n\
    beds fail to keep pace. As a consequence, the Victorian government now\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cencourages\xE2\x80\x9D women to birth at their local, suburban hospital.</p>\n\n\
    <p>For most women, the major anxiety generated by the squeeze is finding\n\
    somewhere, anywhere, to have their baby. But behind the scenes, some\n\
    perinatal specialists and GPs who share the care of pregnant women with\n\
    hospitals are fretting about women being referred away from\n\
    non-sectarian public hospitals and towards institutions that are\n\
    Catholic-run.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The reason why is simple. Catholic-run hospitals, even those dedicated\n\
    to women\xE2\x80\x99s health, have a number of services they will not provide. As\n\
    the Most Rev. Anthony Fisher explained earlier this year: \xE2\x80\x9CCatholic\n\
    healthcare institutions, whatever legal, financial or other pressure\n\
    they are under, may not cooperate with abortion, sterilization or\n\
    euthanasia.\xE2\x80\x9D In addition, and for religious reasons too, Catholic-run\n\
    healthcare institutions don\xE2\x80\x99t offer a full range of contraceptive\n\
    services.</p>\n\n\
    <p>What are the downstream consequences of this refusal to \xE2\x80\x9Ccooperate\xE2\x80\x9D for\n\
    patients? Some women discover, as they approach a planned caesarian\n\
    section, that they won\xE2\x80\x99t be able to have their tubes tied at the time of\n\
    delivery, requiring them to undertake the cost, inconvenience and risk\n\
    of having the procedure done at a later date. Others, already reeling\n\
    from the blow of abnormal results from pre- natal tests or screens the\n\
    hospital did provide, find they must transfer to another institution if\n\
    they make the difficult choice to terminate. Women whose membranes\n\
    rupture too early may be denied surgery to remove the doomed fetus, and\n\
    even intervention to speed up the delivery. That is, unless sepsis is\n\
    diagnosed and the woman\xE2\x80\x99s womb or life is at risk. Rape victims brought\n\
    into casualty will not be offered emergency contraception. If staff\n\
    suspect pregnancy, the woman will not eve be referred to a rape crisis\n\
    centre that does offer the pills.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Do Victorian women know the limits placed on their care when they enter\n\
    a Catholic-run hospital? For many, it seems, the answer is, \xE2\x80\x98no.\xE2\x80\x99 As one\n\
    GP put it, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m not sure women ever do fully understand the\n\
    implications.\xE2\x80\x9D Currently, there seems no attempt for referring hospitals\n\
    to consent women with regard to these issues, nor for Catholic-run\n\
    hospitals to make specific disclosures on such matters when women arrive\n\
    for care. For instance, neither the patient information guide, nor the\n\
    guidelines for those sharing the care of pregnant patients with the\n\
    Mercy makes any reference to the limits the hospital puts on services\n\
    because of its religious views.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Both Catholic-run health institutions, and the Governments that fund\n\
    them to provide essential healthcare services to Victorian taxpayers,\n\
    have an obligation to ensure that female patients, and the external\n\
    healthcare providers sharing care of such patients, are fully informed\n\
    about what the hospital\xE2\x80\x99s religious philosophy might mean for patient\n\
    care. For a hospital to simply say they are Catholic and assume that\n\
    everyone knows what this means, including very young women, new migrants\n\
    to Australia and those from non- English-speaking backgrounds, fails the\n\
    most basic disclosure requirements necessary for informed consent.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But lack of consent is just a small corner of the problem. The real\n\
    issue is the decision by governments to pour public money into\n\
    institutions unable to offer a full range of medical services to half of\n\
    the public. The real problem is government policy that allows such\n\
    institutions to become central to healthcare arrangements designed to\n\
    serve all citizens despite knowing the limits such institutions place on\n\
    the care they provide to women.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Catholics, and any other faith-based minorities in Australia, are\n\
    entitled to their moral beliefs and to the expression of these through\n\
    the institutions they run. But women citizens and taxpayers have a right\n\
    to healthcare provision that does not put them at the mercy of those\n\
    views, and the healthcare information and options that flow from them.\n\
    There seems little problem with Catholic hospitals providing\n\
    boutique-care to women and men able to make an informed decision about\n\
    its suitability to their needs. But when women have no choice but to\n\
    become patients in this system for emergency and essential health care,\n\
    something is terribly wrong.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Catholic Church sees the provision of health care as part of its\n\
    mission, believing that a Catholic-run hospital \xE2\x80\x9Cserves the whole\n\
    community, especially the vulnerable.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Pregnant women are vulnerable. Rape victims are vulnerable. Patients\n\
    without information and real options about their health care are\n\
    vulnerable.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Victorian women pay taxes, and are citizens with a right to informed\n\
    decision-making about and access to the full range of sexual and\n\
    reproductive health services. Not just those the Catholic-run hospital\n\
    nearest them is willing to provide.</p>\n"

    \xE2\x80\x9Cencourages\xE2\x80\x9D women to birth at their local, suburban hospital.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    For most women, the major anxiety generated by the squeeze is finding\r\n\
    somewhere, anywhere, to have their baby. But behind the scenes, some\r\n\
    perinatal specialists and GPs who share the care of pregnant women with\r\n\
    hospitals are fretting about women being referred away from\r\n\
    non-sectarian public hospitals and towards institutions that are\r\n\
    Catholic-run.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The reason why is simple. Catholic-run hospitals, even those dedicated\r\n\
    to women\xE2\x80\x99s health, have a number of services they will not provide. As\r\n\
    the Most Rev. Anthony Fisher explained earlier this year: \xE2\x80\x9CCatholic\r\n\
    healthcare institutions, whatever legal, financial or other pressure\r\n\
    they are under, may not cooperate with abortion, sterilization or\r\n\
    euthanasia.\xE2\x80\x9D In addition, and for religious reasons too, Catholic-run\r\n\
    healthcare institutions don\xE2\x80\x99t offer a full range of contraceptive\r\n\
    services.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    What are the downstream consequences of this refusal to \xE2\x80\x9Ccooperate\xE2\x80\x9D for\r\n\
    patients? Some women discover, as they approach a planned caesarian\r\n\
    section, that they won\xE2\x80\x99t be able to have their tubes tied at the time of\r\n\
    delivery, requiring them to undertake the cost, inconvenience and risk\r\n\
    of having the procedure done at a later date. Others, already reeling\r\n\
    from the blow of abnormal results from pre- natal tests or screens the\r\n\
    hospital did provide, find they must transfer to another institution if\r\n\
    they make the difficult choice to terminate. Women whose membranes\r\n\
    rupture too early may be denied surgery to remove the doomed fetus, and\r\n\
    even intervention to speed up the delivery. That is, unless sepsis is\r\n\
    diagnosed and the woman\xE2\x80\x99s womb or life is at risk. Rape victims brought\r\n\
    into casualty will not be offered emergency contraception. If staff\r\n\
    suspect pregnancy, the woman will not eve be referred to a rape crisis\r\n\
    centre that does offer the pills.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Do Victorian women know the limits placed on their care when they enter\r\n\
    a Catholic-run hospital? For many, it seems, the answer is, \xE2\x80\x98no.\xE2\x80\x99 As one\r\n\
    GP put it, \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x99m not sure women ever do fully understand the\r\n\
    implications.\xE2\x80\x9D Currently, there seems no attempt for referring hospitals\r\n\
    to consent women with regard to these issues, nor for Catholic-run\r\n\
    hospitals to make specific disclosures on such matters when women arrive\r\n\
    for care. For instance, neither the patient information guide, nor the\r\n\
    guidelines for those sharing the care of pregnant patients with the\r\n\
    Mercy makes any reference to the limits the hospital puts on services\r\n\
    because of its religious views.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Both Catholic-run health institutions, and the Governments that fund\r\n\
    them to provide essential healthcare services to Victorian taxpayers,\r\n\
    have an obligation to ensure that female patients, and the external\r\n\
    healthcare providers sharing care of such patients, are fully informed\r\n\
    about what the hospital\xE2\x80\x99s religious philosophy might mean for patient\r\n\
    care. For a hospital to simply say they are Catholic and assume that\r\n\
    everyone knows what this means, including very young women, new migrants\r\n\
    to Australia and those from non- English-speaking backgrounds, fails the\r\n\
    most basic disclosure requirements necessary for informed consent.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But lack of consent is just a small corner of the problem. The real\r\n\
    issue is the decision by governments to pour public money into\r\n\
    institutions unable to offer a full range of medical services to half of\r\n\
    the public. The real problem is government policy that allows such\r\n\
    institutions to become central to healthcare arrangements designed to\r\n\
    serve all citizens despite knowing the limits such institutions place on\r\n\
    the care they provide to women.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Catholics, and any other faith-based minorities in Australia, are\r\n\
    entitled to their moral beliefs and to the expression of these through\r\n\
    the institutions they run. But women citizens and taxpayers have a right\r\n\
    to healthcare provision that does not put them at the mercy of those\r\n\
    views, and the healthcare information and options that flow from them.\r\n\
    There seems little problem with Catholic hospitals providing\r\n\
    boutique-care to women and men able to make an informed decision about\r\n\
    its suitability to their needs. But when women have no choice but to\r\n\
    become patients in this system for emergency and essential health care,\r\n\
    something is terribly wrong.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The Catholic Church sees the provision of health care as part of its\r\n\
    mission, believing that a Catholic-run hospital \xE2\x80\x9Cserves the whole\r\n\
    community, especially the vulnerable.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Pregnant women are vulnerable. Rape victims are vulnerable. Patients\r\n\
    without information and real options about their health care are\r\n\
    vulnerable.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Victorian women pay taxes, and are citizens with a right to informed\r\n\
    decision-making about and access to the full range of sexual and\r\n\
    reproductive health services. Not just those the Catholic-run hospital\r\n\
    nearest them is willing to provide."

  title: Parents Left in the Lurch

  content_markup: "<p>Parental leave &ndash; or maternity leave, as we tiresomely insist on thinking\n\
    about it &ndash; is back in the news. Australia\xE2\x80\x99s National Employment\n\
    Standards now includes the right of workers to request 12 months of\n\
    unpaid parental leave in addition to the year to which they are already\n\
    entitled. A right to request flexible working arrangements to care for a\n\
    child under school age is also part of the \xE2\x80\x9CFair Work\xE2\x80\x9D mix.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Fair? Work? In fact, the new provisions aren\xE2\x80\x99t fair to anyone &ndash; not\n\
    mothers, fathers or children &ndash; and they may reduce even further the\n\
    tenuous attachment Australian mothers have to the workforce. The\n\
    essential conundrum of parenthood can be summed up simply as this:\n\
    working parents of young children want to be in two places at once. They\n\
    want to be caring for their children, and they want (and in most cases\n\
    need) to be in paid work.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This is not, at its core, a gender problem. Young Australian women now\n\
    participate in the workforce at the same rate as men and have similar\n\
    aspirations with regard to earnings and careers. While mothers bear the\n\
    brunt of pregnancy and childbirth, once the cord is cut, fathers,\n\
    grandparents and other relatives &ndash; not to mention trained child-care\n\
    workers &ndash; are all capable of providing quality care for children.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In countries committed to equality between the sexes, the parenthood\n\
    conundrum is articulated in gender-neutral ways. When Sweden\xE2\x80\x99s generous\n\
    parental leave provisions were taken up mostly by mothers, a portion was\n\
    designated for dads on a use-it-or-lose-it basis. This bolstered women\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    attachment to the workforce and freed men to take the time they said\n\
    they wanted to care for their children, without losing points with the\n\
    boss.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Long stretches away from work are bad for employees and despised by\n\
    employers. Jobs are restructured out of existence, and the lifetime\n\
    earnings and superannuation savings of absent workers take a hit from\n\
    which they never recover. It may not be discrimination, but women\xE2\x80\x99s lack\n\
    of hours and experience relative to men &ndash; largely due to \xE2\x80\x9Ccareer\n\
    interruptions\xE2\x80\x9D caused by motherhood &ndash; account for the 17 per cent less\n\
    that Australian women earn on average compared with men.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Men and children also miss out when women are the only ones to withdraw\n\
    from paid employment to shoulder the parenting load. Australian men\n\
    consistently cite work as a barrier to greater involvement with their\n\
    children, while reports on generation Y men suggest they see sharing the\n\
    housework and child care as a moral obligation. Australian children\n\
    report missing their largely absent fathers, while research confirms\n\
    that the presence of a loving and nurturing dad is as important for a\n\
    child\xE2\x80\x99s happiness, wellbeing, and social and academic success as having\n\
    a loving and nurturing mother.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The upshot of all this is that in the absence of carrots and sticks to\n\
    encourage men to step up and women to step out, it will be Australian\n\
    mothers who are most likely to take up the Government\xE2\x80\x99s grant of an\n\
    additional year of unpaid leave, and to wear the associated financial\n\
    and work-related consequences.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The same can be said about the right to request flexible work\n\
    arrangements. Part-time and flexible hours are an essential but\n\
    imperfect tool for solving the parenthood conundrum, yet some workplaces\n\
    continue to expect full-time hours from workers on part-time pay, and\n\
    the reduced visibility or productivity of the flexible workers often\n\
    means they are overlooked for promotion.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Again the problem is equality. If parents of both genders use flexible\n\
    work conditions, then the associated costs will fall to both. But if\n\

    ever tackled by this columnist. The mother of two daughters, aged one\n\
    and three, habitually finds herself in the holidays in the company of a\n\
    child abuser. This, at least, is what she has been told about the\n\
    elderly father of her brother\xE2\x80\x99s wife, who arrives each year at Christmas\n\
    from interstate.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Despite claiming he abused her sexually over many years as a child, the\n\

    this, our reader says the sister-in-law \xE2\x80\x9Cwill not ever leave her own\n\
    children unattended with her father. As soon as my husband and I had\n\
    children, she put us on notice about her father\xE2\x80\x99s past behaviour. He has\n\
    never been reported or prosecuted.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>The situation has left the reader feeling \xE2\x80\x9Chijacked into being friendly\n\

    and continue to watch her daughters like a hawk whenever the man is\n\

    <p>Both are morally unsatisfactory options. Why should innocent children be\n\
    punished by missing out on family events because of the alleged crimes\n\
    of others? Why should their mother have to sacrifice her integrity to\n\
    cover up and compensate for a pedophile?</p>\n\n\
    <p>She shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t. Which is why, in the first instance at least, I\xE2\x80\x99d advise\n\
    against either and recommend a private chat with the sister-in-law. Not\n\
    only might such a conversation provide reassurance about the substance\n\
    of the accusations driving this dilemma, it might also allow our reader\n\
    to ascertain whether continued silence about the abuse is really what\n\
    the sister-in-law wants.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Parents are larger than life to their children. Where abuse was present\n\
    but never acknowledged or atoned for, the adult child may still feel\n\

    them any more.</p>\n\n\
    <p>If this is the case for the sister-in-law, she may want someone to stand\n\

    she may yearn for someone else to confront the abuser with the enormity\n\
    of his crime and demand he take responsibility for its rippling\n\
    consequences.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It is hard to predict the outcome of such a confrontation, which could\n\
    be done by post after the man returns home or, failing a satisfactory\n\
    response, in person when holiday time rolls around again. A best-case\n\
    scenario might see the man apologise and offer to observe restrictions\n\

  title: "Good Parents Send Their Kids to Private School, Don\xE2\x80\x99t They?"
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 18:10:47
  content_markup: "<p>The Bankwest press release was crafted to provoke controversy. \xE2\x80\x9CMore\n\
    Australians Choose a Good Time over Kids Education.\xE2\x80\x9D It had the same\n\
    flavour as the bank\xE2\x80\x99s offering when it released similar market research\n\
    last year. \xE2\x80\x9CAussie families prefer holidays and Botox to private school\n\
    education.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Yes, the Bankwest \xE2\x80\x9CSocial Indicator Series\xE2\x80\x9D is back, demonstrating once\n\
    again that some Australian parents won\xE2\x80\x99t forgo dining out, yoga classes,\n\
    movies or holidays to pay fees for a non-government school.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Not only are parents who don\xE2\x80\x99t sacrifice to send their kids to private\n\
    school vacuous and selfish, they\xE2\x80\x99re stupid, too. As the press release\n\
    makes clear, parent satisfaction with private schools is on the\n\
    increase, while those who send their kids to public school are\n\
    increasingly downcast.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Bankwest\xE2\x80\x99s spokesman, Adrian Bradley, explains the problem clearly.\n\
    Parents just \xE2\x80\x9Caren\xE2\x80\x99t prepared to budge on lifestyle [despite] the widely\n\
    held perception that parents will sacrifice nearly anything in the\n\
    interests of their kids\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Are those who sacrifice house renovations, family holidays, pools,\n\
    dinner, yoga classes or movies to pay for private school good parents,\n\
    while those who refuse to give up such \xE2\x80\x9Cluxuries\xE2\x80\x9D bad?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Bankwest thinks so, for its own self-interested reasons. Parents who\n\
    refuse to sweat about their incapacity to pay close to $15,000 per year\n\
    per darling to send their children to non-government schools are\n\
    decidedly uninterested in the savings products the bank sells. An\n\
    absence of parental anxiety about \xE2\x80\x9Cplanning ahead\xE2\x80\x9D to secure their\n\
    children\xE2\x80\x99s educational future is bad for business.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But back in the real world, who the good and bad parents are is less\n\
    clear. If I hadn\xE2\x80\x99t done yoga when I had two children under two, I would\n\
    have been a snarling, raving, stressed-out mess. I still remember my now\n\
    13-year-old looking up at me as we marched off the beach on the last day\n\
    of a long-ago family holiday. He was two. \xE2\x80\x9CCan we come here always?\xE2\x80\x9D he\n\
    asked, and I knew what he meant.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Can we come to this place where you and Daddy are always around and no\n\
    one is rushing off to work or taking me to creche or cramming me into a\n\
    trolley so we can do the supermarket shopping? Can we come to this place\n\
    where everyone isn\xE2\x80\x99t busy and we\xE2\x80\x99re together all the time? Call it a\n\
    luxury, but our yearly family holiday is the glue that holds my clan\n\

    addition of a flat so the kids can spend more time with grandma, or an\n\
    open-plan kitchen that allows parents to cook while yakking to the kids.</p>\n\n\

  content: "The Bankwest press release was crafted to provoke controversy. \xE2\x80\x9CMore\r\n\
    Australians Choose a Good Time over Kids Education.\xE2\x80\x9D It had the same\r\n\
    flavour as the bank\xE2\x80\x99s offering when it released similar market research\r\n\
    last year. \xE2\x80\x9CAussie families prefer holidays and Botox to private school\r\n\
    education.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Yes, the Bankwest \xE2\x80\x9CSocial Indicator Series\xE2\x80\x9D is back, demonstrating once\r\n\
    again that some Australian parents won\xE2\x80\x99t forgo dining out, yoga classes,\r\n\
    movies or holidays to pay fees for a non-government school.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Not only are parents who don\xE2\x80\x99t sacrifice to send their kids to private\r\n\
    school vacuous and selfish, they\xE2\x80\x99re stupid, too. As the press release\r\n\
    makes clear, parent satisfaction with private schools is on the\r\n\
    increase, while those who send their kids to public school are\r\n\
    increasingly downcast.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Bankwest\xE2\x80\x99s spokesman, Adrian Bradley, explains the problem clearly.\r\n\
    Parents just \xE2\x80\x9Caren\xE2\x80\x99t prepared to budge on lifestyle [despite] the widely\r\n\
    held perception that parents will sacrifice nearly anything in the\r\n\
    interests of their kids\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Are those who sacrifice house renovations, family holidays, pools,\r\n\
    dinner, yoga classes or movies to pay for private school good parents,\r\n\
    while those who refuse to give up such \xE2\x80\x9Cluxuries\xE2\x80\x9D bad?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Bankwest thinks so, for its own self-interested reasons. Parents who\r\n\
    refuse to sweat about their incapacity to pay close to $15,000 per year\r\n\
    per darling to send their children to non-government schools are\r\n\
    decidedly uninterested in the savings products the bank sells. An\r\n\
    absence of parental anxiety about \xE2\x80\x9Cplanning ahead\xE2\x80\x9D to secure their\r\n\
    children\xE2\x80\x99s educational future is bad for business.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But back in the real world, who the good and bad parents are is less\r\n\
    clear. If I hadn\xE2\x80\x99t done yoga when I had two children under two, I would\r\n\
    have been a snarling, raving, stressed-out mess. I still remember my now\r\n\

  title: Pregnancy and Job Seeking. Is it Time to Lie?

  content_markup: "<p>A reader seeks advice on an acutely female ethical dilemma. She has just\n\
    landed a much-wanted interview for a nine-month job, but discovers\n\
    herself pregnant. The child, if born, will be her third. If she\n\
    miscarries, it will be for the third time, too.</p>\n\n\
    <p>She wants the baby but, because of this history, is loath to reveal her\n\
    situation to her prospective employer. She doesn\xE2\x80\x99t even want friends or\n\
    family to know, so why should an interview panel be privy to her private\n\
    news? And if she cruels her chance of employment by telling, then\n\
    miscarries again, she\xE2\x80\x99ll be left with nothing &ndash; neither baby nor job.\n\
    She\xE2\x80\x99s done this before, withdrawn from a selection process for a\n\
    once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, only to lose the pregnancy.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Still she worries about misleading, or worse, being unfair. The law\n\
    matters here. Law and ethics are different but practical moral advice\n\
    must account for what the law forbids or requires. Although NSW law\n\
    allows employers not to hire a woman if she is expecting at the time of\n\
    interview, in most cases a refusal to employ a woman because she is\n\
    pregnant violates federal anti-discrimination law.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This means that if an employer uses a job seeker\xE2\x80\x99s disclosure of\n\
    pregnancy as a reason not to hire her, he is likely to be breaking the\n\
    law: something job applicants are under no obligation to facilitate. If\n\
    the employer heeds the law and disregards fertility status when making\n\
    employment decisions, why should a woman be duty-bound to tell?</p>\n\n\
    <p>But even if the woman is not legally obliged to disclose her pregnancy,\n\
    is she morally bound to do so? I think not, for two reasons.</p>\n\n\
    <p>First, because the implications of a positive pregnancy test in the\n\
    months after conception are unclear. The one in five Australian\n\
    miscarriage rate means that while the result could indicate impending\n\
    motherhood, it may not. I ride my bike to work each day; a friend has\n\
    high blood pressure. We all present some risk to our employers that we\n\
    might fall off our perch. If they need human resources to do the work,\n\
    it is a risk they must take.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Second, because if women have a duty to report all would-be pregnancies\n\
    to a would-be boss, the workplace discrimination and disadvantage they\n\
    already suffer is likely to increase. Why should women be obliged to\n\
    increase the challenges they already face &ndash; as a result of sexism, and\n\
    structural barriers to work-family balance &ndash; in landing, keeping and\n\
    making headway in a job?</p>\n\n\
    <p>The truth is that most sexually active women aged 13 to 50 are at risk\n\
    of being pregnant. If these facts of female fertility, as against the\n\
    male sort, are seen as legitimate grounds for employer discrimination\n\
    then equal opportunity for women will remain a pipe dream: an ideal to\n\
    which we pay lip service but are unwilling to do the hard work to\n\
    achieve.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This is not to say that once hired and sure the pregnancy will stick, a\n\
    pregnant woman ought not disclose to her employer, and do all she can to\n\
    ensure that the requirements of the position are met when she leaves.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It\xE2\x80\x99s easy to mouth platitudes about equal opportunity. Easy to tell our\n\

  title: Support for Dying Friend our Final Gift
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 18:10:28
  content_markup: "<p>A READER &ndash; a qualified scientist I\xE2\x80\x99ll call Ron &ndash; asks for my view on a\n\
    dilemma that pitted his personal and professional integrity, and belief\n\
    in absolute truths, against his love for a dying friend.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Ron\xE2\x80\x99s friend, also a scientist, was dying of cancer. \xE2\x80\x9CHe said that he\n\
    would never use magic bullets,\xE2\x80\x9D Ron says, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut after two years of great\n\
    pain he turned to \xE2\x80\xA6 a [medical] device I knew \xE2\x80\xA6 was a blatant scam.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Should Ron have been honest and told his friend what he thought about\n\
    his medical choices, or supported his friend in the choices he made,\n\
    whatever Ron thought of them? Ron chose to keep his mouth shut. His\n\
    friend died some months later. Now, he wonders, did he do the right\n\
    thing?</p>\n\n\
    <p>I think so. What really mattered in this situation was that Ron kept\n\
    faith with the requirements of being a friend, not with his beliefs\n\
    about the importance of medical interventions having a base in evidence.\n\
    His friend was terminally ill and the Western medical kit bag was\n\
    clearly empty so whatever he chose to do or not do was not likely to\n\
    substantially alter the final result.</p>\n\n\
    <p>People at the end stage of a terminal illness have two options. One is\n\
    to put their affairs in order and live their life to the fullest, in\n\
    full knowledge that death is imminent. The other is to fight, not\n\
    necessarily in the belief they can win, but to assert control by\n\
    resisting the unwanted end.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In Helen Garner\xE2\x80\x99s novel <em>The Spare Room</em>, the dying Nicola injects\n\
    massive doses of vitamin C, then tosses off the pain and noxious side\n\
    effects as evidence the intervention is \xE2\x80\x9Csavaging the tumours and\n\
    driving them out\xE2\x80\x9D. Nicola\xE2\x80\x99s friend, Helen, rails at Nicola\xE2\x80\x99s naivety.\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CTheir treatments are bullshit, Nicola. They\xE2\x80\x99re ripping you off. They\n\
    can\xE2\x80\x99t cure cancer.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>But the truth is that what frightens and enrages Helen is not Nicola\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    non-evidence-based approach to medicine. It\xE2\x80\x99s her friend\xE2\x80\x99s refusal to\n\
    accept her own death. \xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99re using that bloody clinic to distract\n\
    yourself,\xE2\x80\x9D Helen tells Nicola.\\\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t say it, Hel,\xE2\x80\x9D says Nicola. She raises one palm. \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t tell me.\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    But Helen won\xE2\x80\x99t be stopped. \xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99ve got to get ready.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>It is easier for those of us who love and care for the terminally ill to\n\
    witness their smooth transition through the Kubler-Ross stages of dying:\n\
    denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. We sleep better\n\
    knowing that as their time approached, our friend or family member was\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cready\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cat peace\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The truth is that not everyone does dying the same way. Some will never\n\
    come to acceptance. They will \xE2\x80\x9Cgo on fighting right to their last\n\
    breath\xE2\x80\x9D, explains the nurse who comes to look after Nicola. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd it is\n\
    one way of doing it.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>For Helen, it was recognising that it was not the idiotic fruitlessness\n\
    of Nicola\xE2\x80\x99s vitamin C detox that was distressing and enraging her. It\n\
    was Nicola\xE2\x80\x99s inability to \xE2\x80\x9Cwork towards a glorious moment of\n\
    enlightenment\xE2\x80\x9D and to admit she was dying and, by so doing, allow Helen\n\
    and others who loved her to accept and be open about it, too.</p>\n\n\

  content: "A READER - a qualified scientist I\xE2\x80\x99ll call Ron - asks for my view on a\r\n\
    dilemma that pitted his personal and professional integrity, and belief\r\n\
    in absolute truths, against his love for a dying friend.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Ron\xE2\x80\x99s friend, also a scientist, was dying of cancer. \xE2\x80\x9CHe said that he\r\n\
    would never use magic bullets,\xE2\x80\x9D Ron says, \xE2\x80\x9Cbut after two years of great\r\n\
    pain he turned to \xE2\x80\xA6 a [medical] device I knew \xE2\x80\xA6 was a blatant scam.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Should Ron have been honest and told his friend what he thought about\r\n\
    his medical choices, or supported his friend in the choices he made,\r\n\
    whatever Ron thought of them? Ron chose to keep his mouth shut. His\r\n\
    friend died some months later. Now, he wonders, did he do the right\r\n\
    thing?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I think so. What really mattered in this situation was that Ron kept\r\n\
    faith with the requirements of being a friend, not with his beliefs\r\n\
    about the importance of medical interventions having a base in evidence.\r\n\
    His friend was terminally ill and the Western medical kit bag was\r\n\
    clearly empty so whatever he chose to do or not do was not likely to\r\n\
    substantially alter the final result.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    People at the end stage of a terminal illness have two options. One is\r\n\
    to put their affairs in order and live their life to the fullest, in\r\n\
    full knowledge that death is imminent. The other is to fight, not\r\n\
    necessarily in the belief they can win, but to assert control by\r\n\
    resisting the unwanted end.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In Helen Garner\xE2\x80\x99s novel *The Spare Room*, the dying Nicola injects\r\n\
    massive doses of vitamin C, then tosses off the pain and noxious side\r\n\
    effects as evidence the intervention is \xE2\x80\x9Csavaging the tumours and\r\n\
    driving them out\xE2\x80\x9D. Nicola\xE2\x80\x99s friend, Helen, rails at Nicola\xE2\x80\x99s naivety.\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CTheir treatments are bullshit, Nicola. They\xE2\x80\x99re ripping you off. They\r\n\
    can\xE2\x80\x99t cure cancer.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But the truth is that what frightens and enrages Helen is not Nicola\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    non-evidence-based approach to medicine. It\xE2\x80\x99s her friend\xE2\x80\x99s refusal to\r\n\
    accept her own death. \xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99re using that bloody clinic to distract\r\n\
    yourself,\xE2\x80\x9D Helen tells Nicola.\\\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t say it, Hel,\xE2\x80\x9D says Nicola. She raises one palm. \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t tell me.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    But Helen won\xE2\x80\x99t be stopped. \xE2\x80\x9CYou\xE2\x80\x99ve got to get ready.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It is easier for those of us who love and care for the terminally ill to\r\n\
    witness their smooth transition through the Kubler-Ross stages of dying:\r\n\
    denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. We sleep better\r\n\
    knowing that as their time approached, our friend or family member was\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cready\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cat peace\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The truth is that not everyone does dying the same way. Some will never\r\n\
    come to acceptance. They will \xE2\x80\x9Cgo on fighting right to their last\r\n\
    breath\xE2\x80\x9D, explains the nurse who comes to look after Nicola. \xE2\x80\x9CAnd it is\r\n\
    one way of doing it.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    For Helen, it was recognising that it was not the idiotic fruitlessness\r\n\
    of Nicola\xE2\x80\x99s vitamin C detox that was distressing and enraging her. It\r\n\
    was Nicola\xE2\x80\x99s inability to \xE2\x80\x9Cwork towards a glorious moment of\r\n\
    enlightenment\xE2\x80\x9D and to admit she was dying and, by so doing, allow Helen\r\n\
    and others who loved her to accept and be open about it, too.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    However painful we find it, supporting our friends to die as they see\r\n\
    fit can be our final gift to them. Biting his tongue, as Ron did about\r\n\
    the sham nature of his friend\xE2\x80\x99s last-ditch medical efforts, didn\xE2\x80\x99t\r\n\
    compromise Ron\xE2\x80\x99s integrity. It gave his friend permission to die\r\n\
    fighting and was the act of a true friend."

  title: Role of Big Pharma in question after half a century of the pill
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 18:10:19
  content_markup: "<p><em>An independent study is needed of the pill\xE2\x80\x99s impact on women\xE2\x80\x99s lives.</em></p>\n\n\
    <p>IF YOU don\xE2\x80\x99t know it yet, you will soon. This year in the US, Bayer\n\
    Schering Pharma is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the oral\n\
    contraceptive pill. Our turn comes next. The company launched the pill\n\
    in Australia in 1961.</p>\n\n\
    <p>As head of a women\xE2\x80\x99s reproductive rights advocacy group, I got the news\n\
    early, in a letter from Bayer\xE2\x80\x99s business unit telling of their planned\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cnational communication program\xE2\x80\x9D to inform the public of \xE2\x80\x9Cthis important\n\
    milestone in women\xE2\x80\x99s healthcare\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It invited me to \xE2\x80\x9Cbegin a dialogue of collaboration\xE2\x80\x9D that involved, as\n\
    far as I could tell when I rang the number supplied, my group singing\n\
    from the Bayer song sheet about the company\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cproud heritage\xE2\x80\x9D and\n\
    current practice of \xE2\x80\x9Cproviding women with reliable and trusted\n\
    contraceptive options\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Already the media blitz has begun, with reports of a study showing that\n\
    women taking the pill have a lower risk of dying from any cause when\n\
    compared with women who have never taken it. In fact, the research,\n\
    partly funded by Schering &ndash; and with authors who list as competing\n\
    interests the receipt of payments from Schering Plough and Wyeth\n\
    Pharmaceutical &ndash; concludes only that \xE2\x80\x9Cat least in \xE2\x80\xA6 [a] relatively\n\
    healthy \xE2\x80\xA6 cohort, oral contraception is not significantly associated\n\
    with a major public health problem\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>A more critical non-profit-driven analysis of the pill\xE2\x80\x99s impact on\n\
    women\xE2\x80\x99s health and lives reveals long-standing feminist scepticism about\n\
    the first drug in history to be approved for long-term use by a healthy\n\
    person. It was known before the first pill ever hit the market that\n\
    estrogen increased the risk of cancer, but the first pill contained\n\
    massive amounts of it &ndash; seven times as much as is used today.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In 1969, investigative journalist Barbara Seaman blew the whistle with\n\
    <em>The Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s Case against the Pill</em>. The book prompted a US Senate\n\
    investigation that saw the pill become the first prescription drug to be\n\
    accompanied by package insert warnings. Seaman was blacklisted for her\n\
    trouble.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Magazines, under pressure from the pharmaceutical industry threatening\n\
    to withdraw advertising dollars, refused to run her stories.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The pill provides no protection against sexually transmitted infections,\n\
    as some of those who came of age in the era of HIV/AIDS learned at their\n\
    peril.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Second and third-generation pills may put users at increased risk of\n\
    deep vein thrombosis (especially if they are overweight), heart trouble\n\
    (if they smoke), breast cancer (in the short term) and cervical cancer\n\
    (in the longer term), although for some cancers, the drug seems\n\
    protective.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The pill is contraindicated for women with a history of migraines,\n\
    jaundice or liver problems and safety scares are not a thing of the\n\
    past. In the mid\xE2\x80\x931990s, women in some parts of Europe were told that\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cthird generation\xE2\x80\x9D pills posed a greater risk of potentially fatal blood\n\
    clots than their just-as-effective predecessors.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The accumulation of such data led Public Citizen, a US consumer advocacy\n\
    group, to petition the US Food and Drug Administration in 2007 to remove\n\
    the pills from sale.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Despite all this, Seaman said shortly before her death in 2008 that if\n\
    her daughters had wanted to go on the pill, she might have cried, but if\n\
    her granddaughters should choose to, she could \xE2\x80\x9Clive with that\xE2\x80\x9D. Not\n\
    that she believed no questions remained, including those about possible\n\
    interactions between the pill and antidepressants, the most common drug\n\
    prescribed to Australian women.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Indeed, what becomes clear from looking at what data exists, is the\n\
    corruptive effect of pharmaceutical money on the knowledge necessary to\n\
    give women the information they need to make informed medical choices.\n\
    Drug company-sponsored research tends to focus on potential new\n\

  content: "*An independent study is needed of the pill\xE2\x80\x99s impact on women\xE2\x80\x99s lives.*\r\n\
    \r\n\
    IF YOU don\xE2\x80\x99t know it yet, you will soon. This year in the US, Bayer\r\n\
    Schering Pharma is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the oral\r\n\
    contraceptive pill. Our turn comes next. The company launched the pill\r\n\
    in Australia in 1961.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    As head of a women\xE2\x80\x99s reproductive rights advocacy group, I got the news\r\n\
    early, in a letter from Bayer\xE2\x80\x99s business unit telling of their planned\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cnational communication program\xE2\x80\x9D to inform the public of \xE2\x80\x9Cthis important\r\n\
    milestone in women\xE2\x80\x99s healthcare\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It invited me to \xE2\x80\x9Cbegin a dialogue of collaboration\xE2\x80\x9D that involved, as\r\n\
    far as I could tell when I rang the number supplied, my group singing\r\n\
    from the Bayer song sheet about the company\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Cproud heritage\xE2\x80\x9D and\r\n\
    current practice of \xE2\x80\x9Cproviding women with reliable and trusted\r\n\
    contraceptive options\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Already the media blitz has begun, with reports of a study showing that\r\n\
    women taking the pill have a lower risk of dying from any cause when\r\n\
    compared with women who have never taken it. In fact, the research,\r\n\
    partly funded by Schering - and with authors who list as competing\r\n\
    interests the receipt of payments from Schering Plough and Wyeth\r\n\
    Pharmaceutical - concludes only that \xE2\x80\x9Cat least in \xE2\x80\xA6 [a] relatively\r\n\
    healthy \xE2\x80\xA6 cohort, oral contraception is not significantly associated\r\n\
    with a major public health problem\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    A more critical non-profit-driven analysis of the pill\xE2\x80\x99s impact on\r\n\
    women\xE2\x80\x99s health and lives reveals long-standing feminist scepticism about\r\n\
    the first drug in history to be approved for long-term use by a healthy\r\n\
    person. It was known before the first pill ever hit the market that\r\n\
    estrogen increased the risk of cancer, but the first pill contained\r\n\
    massive amounts of it - seven times as much as is used today.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In 1969, investigative journalist Barbara Seaman blew the whistle with\r\n\
    *The Doctor\xE2\x80\x99s Case against the Pill*. The book prompted a US Senate\r\n\
    investigation that saw the pill become the first prescription drug to be\r\n\
    accompanied by package insert warnings. Seaman was blacklisted for her\r\n\
    trouble.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Magazines, under pressure from the pharmaceutical industry threatening\r\n\
    to withdraw advertising dollars, refused to run her stories.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The pill provides no protection against sexually transmitted infections,\r\n\
    as some of those who came of age in the era of HIV/AIDS learned at their\r\n\
    peril.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Second and third-generation pills may put users at increased risk of\r\n\
    deep vein thrombosis (especially if they are overweight), heart trouble\r\n\
    (if they smoke), breast cancer (in the short term) and cervical cancer\r\n\
    (in the longer term), although for some cancers, the drug seems\r\n\
    protective.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The pill is contraindicated for women with a history of migraines,\r\n\
    jaundice or liver problems and safety scares are not a thing of the\r\n\
    past. In the mid\xE2\x80\x931990s, women in some parts of Europe were told that\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cthird generation\xE2\x80\x9D pills posed a greater risk of potentially fatal blood\r\n\
    clots than their just-as-effective predecessors.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The accumulation of such data led Public Citizen, a US consumer advocacy\r\n\
    group, to petition the US Food and Drug Administration in 2007 to remove\r\n\
    the pills from sale.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Despite all this, Seaman said shortly before her death in 2008 that if\r\n\
    her daughters had wanted to go on the pill, she might have cried, but if\r\n\
    her granddaughters should choose to, she could \xE2\x80\x9Clive with that\xE2\x80\x9D. Not\r\n\
    that she believed no questions remained, including those about possible\r\n\
    interactions between the pill and antidepressants, the most common drug\r\n\
    prescribed to Australian women.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Indeed, what becomes clear from looking at what data exists, is the\r\n\
    corruptive effect of pharmaceutical money on the knowledge necessary to\r\n\
    give women the information they need to make informed medical choices.\r\n\
    Drug company-sponsored research tends to focus on potential new\r\n\
    indications for old pharmaceuticals, or the relative benefits of a\r\n\
    company\xE2\x80\x99s new drug, compared with older offerings. Little research is\r\n\
    available that compares drugs with non-pharmaceutical responses to\r\n\
    women\xE2\x80\x99s healthcare needs.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The sexual revolution underwritten by the pill was, on balance, a boon\r\n\
    for women, though it too came with downsides. The enthusiastic promotion\r\n\
    of the pill by population control agencies, the medical establishment\r\n\
    and the pharmaceutical industry - a tripartite cheer squad that\r\n\
    continues to this day - led quickly to a view that all women were or\r\n\
    should be \xE2\x80\x9Con it\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This has largely absented men from fiscal and social responsibility for\r\n\
    contraception and the consequences of unplanned pregnancies (bye-bye\r\n\
    shotgun marriages), despite the persistence of unlawful abortion\r\n\
    \r\n\
    and the stigma of single motherhood.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Drug companies aren\xE2\x80\x99t feminist organisations, nor deliberate drivers of\r\n\
    radical social innovation designed to benefit women. They are\r\n\
    businesses, seeking profits for shareholders through the creation and\r\n\

    &ndash; so-called\xE2\x80\x9D is impolite or unethical.</p>\n\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CSo-called\xE2\x80\x9D arranges dates at the last minute, then breaks them even\n\

    wants them to agree with her that the \xE2\x80\x9Cinconsiderate, self-centred\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    bloke is more than just rude. He\xE2\x80\x99s immoral.</p>\n\n\
    <p>What, she wonders, do I think?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Ethicists like to draw a firm distinction between ethics and etiquette\n\
    but the truth is that the categories overlap.</p>\n\n\
    <p>At their most trivial, manners are about preserving class distinctions\n\
    through the enforcement of rigid, and at times nonsensical, codes of\n\
    behaviour for when one is in the company of (relative) strangers.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Proscriptions against putting your elbows on the table or touching the\n\
    Queen unless she extends her hand first are good examples.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But at the pointier end of etiquette, the distinction between manners\n\
    and morals all but disappears. Prohibitions on interrupting may serve\n\
    the more superficial goal of smoothing the rough edges of conversational\n\
    engagements but also provide a way for individuals to indicate their\n\
    moral respect for others through the other-centred act of listening.</p>\n\n\
    <p>A person who constantly interrupts may show not just that he is\n\
    ill-bred, but so self-absorbed that the only person\xE2\x80\x99s ideas and feelings\n\
    he deems worth hearing are his own. From the sound of it, Pria is right.\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CSo-called\xE2\x80\x9D seems to be afflicted not just by a deficit of manners, but\n\
    of morals, too. Yes, it is rude to cancel arrangements at short notice.\n\
    Sometimes, however, it cannot be avoided.</p>\n\n\
    <p>When the inconvenience caused by such breach of etiquette is accompanied\n\
    by an apology, a sincere promise to avoid it happening again and\n\
    reimbursement for all wasted depilation and hair-styling efforts (just\n\
    joking, sort of) it can and should be forgiven.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But chronic rudeness on this or other fronts may indicate the presence\n\
    of more serious moral disorders. A man who continually backs out of\n\
    arrangements with a woman is communicating a number of things.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Among them is, \xE2\x80\x9CMy time, and all the terribly important things I do with\n\
    it, is more important than yours.\xE2\x80\x9D To say this to another, or imply it\n\
    through your actions, is imperious and high-handed. Not just rude but\n\
    morally arrogant.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It could even be indicative, in extreme cases, of narcissism &ndash; extreme\n\
    selfishness and excessive self-love resulting in an inability to sustain\n\
    long-term relationships. If \xE2\x80\x9Cso-called\xE2\x80\x9D is \xE2\x80\x9Cjust not that into\xE2\x80\x9D Pria &ndash;\n\
    and it certainly sounds this way &ndash; he should have the decency to say so.\n\
    It\xE2\x80\x99s not a crime not to love someone &ndash; you either do or you don\xE2\x80\x99t &ndash; but\n\
    it is wrong to treat someone as if she were unloveable.</p>\n\n\
    <p>If \xE2\x80\x9Cso-called\xE2\x80\x9D can\xE2\x80\x99t or won\xE2\x80\x99t love Pria, he needs to do the right thing\n\
    and let her go, so she can find someone who will.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The fact that she has not demanded this, and may even have acted like a\n\
    doormat in some ways when it came to \xE2\x80\x9Cso-called\xE2\x80\x99s\xE2\x80\x9D repeated antics, does\n\
    not entirely excuse him from walking all over her. He needs to take a\n\
    good hard look at himself and, for her own good, Pria does, too.</p>\n"

    but the truth is that the categories overlap.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    At their most trivial, manners are about preserving class distinctions\r\n\
    through the enforcement of rigid, and at times nonsensical, codes of\r\n\
    behaviour for when one is in the company of (relative) strangers.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Proscriptions against putting your elbows on the table or touching the\r\n\
    Queen unless she extends her hand first are good examples.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But at the pointier end of etiquette, the distinction between manners\r\n\
    and morals all but disappears. Prohibitions on interrupting may serve\r\n\
    the more superficial goal of smoothing the rough edges of conversational\r\n\
    engagements but also provide a way for individuals to indicate their\r\n\
    moral respect for others through the other-centred act of listening.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    A person who constantly interrupts may show not just that he is\r\n\
    ill-bred, but so self-absorbed that the only person\xE2\x80\x99s ideas and feelings\r\n\
    he deems worth hearing are his own. From the sound of it, Pria is right.\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CSo-called\xE2\x80\x9D seems to be afflicted not just by a deficit of manners, but\r\n\
    of morals, too. Yes, it is rude to cancel arrangements at short notice.\r\n\
    Sometimes, however, it cannot be avoided.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    When the inconvenience caused by such breach of etiquette is accompanied\r\n\
    by an apology, a sincere promise to avoid it happening again and\r\n\
    reimbursement for all wasted depilation and hair-styling efforts (just\r\n\
    joking, sort of) it can and should be forgiven.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But chronic rudeness on this or other fronts may indicate the presence\r\n\
    of more serious moral disorders. A man who continually backs out of\r\n\
    arrangements with a woman is communicating a number of things.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Among them is, \xE2\x80\x9CMy time, and all the terribly important things I do with\r\n\
    it, is more important than yours.\xE2\x80\x9D To say this to another, or imply it\r\n\
    through your actions, is imperious and high-handed. Not just rude but\r\n\
    morally arrogant.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It could even be indicative, in extreme cases, of narcissism - extreme\r\n\
    selfishness and excessive self-love resulting in an inability to sustain\r\n\
    long-term relationships. If \xE2\x80\x9Cso-called\xE2\x80\x9D is \xE2\x80\x9Cjust not that into\xE2\x80\x9D Pria -\r\n\
    and it certainly sounds this way - he should have the decency to say so.\r\n\
    It\xE2\x80\x99s not a crime not to love someone - you either do or you don\xE2\x80\x99t - but\r\n\
    it is wrong to treat someone as if she were unloveable.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    If \xE2\x80\x9Cso-called\xE2\x80\x9D can\xE2\x80\x99t or won\xE2\x80\x99t love Pria, he needs to do the right thing\r\n\
    and let her go, so she can find someone who will.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The fact that she has not demanded this, and may even have acted like a\r\n\
    doormat in some ways when it came to \xE2\x80\x9Cso-called\xE2\x80\x99s\xE2\x80\x9D repeated antics, does\r\n\
    not entirely excuse him from walking all over her. He needs to take a\r\n\
    good hard look at himself and, for her own good, Pria does, too."

    <p>TEASE: We tend to think of patents as good, or at least necessary, legal\n\

    <p>But where wrongly applied, patents can stifle innovation, drive up costs\n\
    and restrict access to medicines and diagnostic tests. They can put\n\

    <p>Patents on genes do just that, yet the Australian government continues\n\
    to grant them every year. To date, about 15,000 patents on human genes\n\

    Tay-Sachs and Alzheimer\xE2\x80\x99s disease.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Among the most high-profile victims of inappropriate patents are women\n\
    at risk, or suffering from, hereditary breast or ovarian cancer. Myriad\n\
    Genetics has patents on two of the genes that predict such cancers.\n\
    Their proprietary control means scientists must seek Myriad\xE2\x80\x99s permission\n\
    to use the genes in studies designed to understand the cancers and to\n\
    develop effective cures. Myriad has also used its monopolistic control\n\
    to prevent women getting tested, to find out whether they carry the\n\
    gene, in non-Myriad laboratories.</p>\n\n\

    target the taxpayer. When Amgen had its 20-year patents on anaemia\n\
    treatment erythropoietin (EPO) extended by the Australian patent office\n\
    a few years back, $250 million was added to the public health bill. At\n\
    least the treatment remains available.</p>\n\n\
    <p>At the Westmead Children\xE2\x80\x99s Hospital in Sydney, doctors are prohibited by\n\
    a patent on the SCN1A gene from testing infants for epilepsy. This is\n\
    despite the fact that those babies\xE2\x80\x99 parents, and all other taxpayers,\n\
    funded the research that identified the gene in the first place.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Americans have had enough. In a landmark decision last month, a New York\n\
    court ruled that patents for the genes associated with hereditary breast\n\
    and ovarian cancer should never have been granted. The judge ruled that\n\
    genes are products of nature, not innovations that can or should be made\n\
    corporate property. Genes are part of all our bodies, the court noted,\n\

  content_markup: "<p>Tony Abbott is said to be likeable. I believe it, though I\xE2\x80\x99ve only met\n\
    him once. Introduced by a <em>Crikey!</em> journalist in Parliament House\n\

    ministerial control over the fertility control drug RU486, the Health\n\
    Minister refused to shake my hand.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It was an honest move from an un-stage-managed man, and I didn\xE2\x80\x99t have a\n\
    problem with it. He didn\xE2\x80\x99t like me and he let it show. It was as\n\
    straight and simple as that.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Opposition leader\xE2\x80\x99s recent attacks on the Prime Minister\xE2\x80\x99s character\n\
    are designed to highlight this virtue. By accusing Kevin Rudd of\n\
    waffle-speak, standing for nothing and \xE2\x80\x9Cgutless[ing] out,\xE2\x80\x9D Abbott\n\
    invites us to brand him in contrasting terms: as a straight-talking\n\
    leader with strong views and values, and a willingness to defend them.</p>\n\n\
    <p>All fine and good, though it does beg the question-what does Abbott\n\
    believe in? As Prime Minister, what policies would we expect him to\n\
    design, and to fight to implement?</p>\n\n\
    <p>Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s background, employment history and associations offer some\n\
    clues. Born in 1957, he was schooled at (Jesuit) St Ignatius College\n\
    before studying for the Priesthood. He subsequently worked as a\n\
    journalist and political press secretary before leading the successful\n\
    campaign against an Australian republic. He is associated with groups\n\
    that favour censorship but are opposed to legal abortion, dying with\n\
    dignity, stem-cell research and gay rights. These include the National\n\
    Civic Council, the Lyons Forum, the Endeavour Forum and the Australian\n\
    Christian Lobby.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Abbott recently described Aboriginal welcome to country ceremonies as a\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cgenuflection to political correctness\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cout-of-place tokenism.\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    However, he believes Federal Parliament should continue to start the day\n\
    with the Lord\xE2\x80\x99s Prayer.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Abbott believes the \xE2\x80\x9Cargument [on climate change] is absolute crap\xE2\x80\x9D. So\n\
    far, he has rejected all proven and economically orthodox means of\n\
    pricing carbon.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Abbott told <em>60 Minutes</em> in what he later described as a \xE2\x80\x9Cspontaneous\n\
    answer\xE2\x80\x9D that homosexuality makes him feel \xE2\x80\x9Ca bit threatened.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Health Minister Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s statements and policies on abortion renewed\n\
    national debate about the issue. He described \xE2\x80\x9Cthe fact that 100,000\n\
    [Australian] women choose to end their pregnancies\xE2\x80\x9D as a \xE2\x80\x9Cnational\n\
    tragedy\xE2\x80\x9D that left a \xE2\x80\x9Clegacy of unutterable shame.\xE2\x80\x9D He said there was \xE2\x80\x9Ca\n\
    bizarre double standard\xE2\x80\xA6where someone who kills a pregnant woman\xE2\x80\x99s baby\n\
    is guilty of murder but a woman who aborts an unborn baby is simply\n\
    exercising choice.\xE2\x80\x9D The figure of 100,000 turned out to be wrong.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Abbott voted against legislation allowing Australian scientists to do\n\
    research using embryonic stem cells.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Abbott wants to return to at fault-divorce, supporting legislation that\n\
    would require spouses to prove offences like adultery, habitual\n\
    drunkenness or cruelty before they can separate.</p>\n\n\
    <p>At the launch of a collection of B.A. Santamaria\xE2\x80\x99s letters, Abbott\n\
    lauded his mentor for the view that \xE2\x80\x9Cit [is] impossible to be a passive\n\
    Christian.\xE2\x80\x9D Abbott argued that the Howard government\xE2\x80\x99s decisions to\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Coverturn the Northern Territory\xE2\x80\x99s euthanasia law, ban gay marriage,\n\
    stop the ACT heroin trial, provide additional financial support for\n\
    one-income families, and try to reduce abortion numbers through\n\
    pregnancy support counseling\xE2\x80\x9D showed that the \xE2\x80\x9Ceight Catholics\xE2\x80\xA6in\n\
    the\xE2\x80\xA6Cabinet\xE2\x80\x9D had turned the \xE2\x80\x9Ctide of secular humanism.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Despite this, he recently implied on ABC\xE2\x80\x99s <em>Q&amp;A</em> that public and media\n\
    interest in his Catholic beliefs was unfair.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This is who Tony Abbott is and what he believes. It\xE2\x80\x99s up to us to decide\n\
    whether we want this sort of man, fighting for this sort of Australia,\n\
    to be the next PM.</p>\n"

    Abbott told *60 Minutes* in what he later described as a \xE2\x80\x9Cspontaneous\r\n\
    answer\xE2\x80\x9D that homosexuality makes him feel \xE2\x80\x9Ca bit threatened.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Health Minister Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s statements and policies on abortion renewed\r\n\
    national debate about the issue. He described \xE2\x80\x9Cthe fact that 100,000\r\n\
    [Australian] women choose to end their pregnancies\xE2\x80\x9D as a \xE2\x80\x9Cnational\r\n\
    tragedy\xE2\x80\x9D that left a \xE2\x80\x9Clegacy of unutterable shame.\xE2\x80\x9D He said there was \xE2\x80\x9Ca\r\n\
    bizarre double standard\xE2\x80\xA6where someone who kills a pregnant woman\xE2\x80\x99s baby\r\n\
    is guilty of murder but a woman who aborts an unborn baby is simply\r\n\
    exercising choice.\xE2\x80\x9D The figure of 100,000 turned out to be wrong.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Abbott voted against legislation allowing Australian scientists to do\r\n\
    research using embryonic stem cells.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Abbott wants to return to at fault-divorce, supporting legislation that\r\n\
    would require spouses to prove offences like adultery, habitual\r\n\
    drunkenness or cruelty before they can separate.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    At the launch of a collection of B.A. Santamaria\xE2\x80\x99s letters, Abbott\r\n\
    lauded his mentor for the view that \xE2\x80\x9Cit [is] impossible to be a passive\r\n\
    Christian.\xE2\x80\x9D Abbott argued that the Howard government\xE2\x80\x99s decisions to\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Coverturn the Northern Territory\xE2\x80\x99s euthanasia law, ban gay marriage,\r\n\
    stop the ACT heroin trial, provide additional financial support for\r\n\
    one-income families, and try to reduce abortion numbers through\r\n\
    pregnancy support counseling\xE2\x80\x9D showed that the \xE2\x80\x9Ceight Catholics\xE2\x80\xA6in\r\n\
    the\xE2\x80\xA6Cabinet\xE2\x80\x9D had turned the \xE2\x80\x9Ctide of secular humanism.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Despite this, he recently implied on ABC\xE2\x80\x99s *Q&A* that public and media\r\n\
    interest in his Catholic beliefs was unfair.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This is who Tony Abbott is and what he believes. It\xE2\x80\x99s up to us to decide\r\n\
    whether we want this sort of man, fighting for this sort of Australia,\r\n\
    to be the next PM."

    parents, like most of their peers, were taken in by heroic media\n\
    depictions of Jonas Salk, inventor of the polio vaccine, and the\n\
    outpouring of scientific ingenuity in the cold war race to the moon.\n\
    Like many of the children of this doctor-knows best generation, I was\n\
    formula-fed, fully vaccinated and dosed with antibiotics at the first\n\
    sign of sore throat.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Only one of these health prescriptions-vaccination-is alive and well\n\
    today, though recent claims by Jim Carey\xE2\x80\x99s wife Jenny McCarthy on Oprah\n\
    that vaccination caused her son\xE2\x80\x99s autism have some parents running\n\
    scared. At the same time, Australia\xE2\x80\x99s efforts to halt climate change\n\
    have ground to a halt. In the wake of errors in the report by\n\
    Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the \xE2\x80\x98climategate\xE2\x80\x99 email\n\
    row-which saw British scientists accused of massaging climate data to\n\
    disguise falling temperatures-public distrust of climate science is at\n\
    an all time high. Such scares and scandals, writes Hannah Devlin in the\n\
    Times Online, have \xE2\x80\x9Cworrying implications\xE2\x80\xA6 for the integrity of\n\
    scientific research\xE2\x80\xA6and for the credibility of the scientific method\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The scientific method provides a way of knowing that, like democracy,\n\
    may be the worst way of knowing things, except for all those other ways\n\
    that have been tried. Scientists are people who know how to use the\n\
    method, and understand that only those claims that survive it can be\n\
    called \xE2\x80\x9Cfacts\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Ctrue.\xE2\x80\x9D The rest is just conjecture. If we want the\n\
    most reliable facts available about the world available, science is our\n\
    method, and scientists the go-to boys and girls.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But we don\xE2\x80\x99t trust science-and revere scientific authorities-like we\n\
    once did, who is to blame? The bone is usually pointed at the media,\n\
    which does bear some responsibility for the problem. This is seen most\n\
    clearly in the climate change debate, where the standing given to the\n\
    contrary position of denialists gives them credibility that as mostly\n\
    non-scientists, they haven\xE2\x80\x99t earned.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Climate change deniers are largely funded by conservative think-tanks\n\
    that are, in turn, backed by some of the biggest and wealthiest\n\
    carbon-emitting corporates on the planet. In one study, 78 per cent of\n\
    books denying the reality of climate change or the need to act on it\n\
    were linked to conservative think tanks. Few of these authors had a PhD,\n\
    even from less-than-relevant scientific disciplines like biology.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Despite this, the \xE2\x80\x9Cbalance\xE2\x80\x9D requirement sees climate change deniers\n\
    regularly trotted out and given equal standing on the podium with\n\
    scientists with relevant expertise, or allowed to fly solo in extended\n\
    media interviews. When Lord Christopher Mockton, the 3rd Viscount\n\
    Monckton of Brenchley, British business consultant, policy adviser,\n\
    writer, columnist, puzzle inventor and climate change denier was in\n\
    Australia recently, he appeared in the media 455 times. In contrast,\n\
    when scientist James Hansen touched down at about the same time-Hansen\n\
    heads NASA\xE2\x80\x99s Goddard Institute for Space Studies and is an adjunct\n\
    professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at\n\
    Columbia University-he gained only 61 media mentions.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But the power of capitalist marketing and longstanding media modus\n\
    operandi are not solely to blame. Scientific researchers, the businesses\n\
    that commercialise and market their work and those who barrack\n\
    uncritically for them from the sidelines, also bear some responsibility\n\
    for declining levels of public trust in science. Vaccination is a\n\
    classic case. Public health programs to support childhood immunisation\n\
    rely on public trust that the jabs children are getting are both safe\n\
    and effective. The health bureaucracy, medical doctors and\n\
    community-based organizations vigorously promote vaccination as part of\n\
    what they see as their broader remit to lionise evidence-based medicine\n\
    over unproven cures.</p>\n\n\
    <p>All well and good, except when real problems arise with vaccination, and\n\
    such groups go to ground. Just last month, the Australian government was\n\
    forced to suspend the national flu vaccination program for children\n\
    under five after adverse reactions by hundreds of children around the\n\
    nation, some requiring hospitalization. Media reports soon raised the\n\
    possibility that a \xE2\x80\x9Ctoo cosy\xE2\x80\x9D relationship between the vaccine\n\
    manufacturer and the government may have corrupted decisions about its\n\
    use, and that parents had been told to give it to their kids before\n\
    adequate safety and efficacy testing and a proper risk/benefit analysis\n\
    had been done.</p>\n\n\
    <p>For example, Professor Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases expert\n\
    from the Australian National University, told the ABC that before\n\
    vaccines were approved and recommended for use by government, better\n\
    studies and risk/benefit analyses were needed. \xE2\x80\x9CBefore we roll out a\n\
    vaccine to millions of people\xE2\x80\xA6we need to do studies of thousands of\n\
    people over a period of time to make sure we are always going to do more\n\
    good than harm with the vaccine\xE2\x80\xA6[Currently we don\xE2\x80\x99t have] enough data to\n\
    know how effective [the vaccine is] going to be.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>In the wake of the problem, and issues arising at around the same time\n\
    with a childhood pneumococcal vaccination, researchers at the Telethon\n\
    Institute for Child Health have made urgent calls for a whole-of-life\n\
    immunization register to help evaluate the safety and effectiveness of\n\
    vaccination programs.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Such claims would no doubt be shocking to many Australians, who may have\n\
    assumed that those who tout the importance of evidence, actually\n\
    practice what they preach. Australians who might have assumed that the\n\
    medical interventions their government pays for and their doctors\n\
    promote are supported by a rigorous and fulsome evidence-based:\n\
    otherwise why would they support them? That these assumptions may be\n\
    false can, and should be expected, to have a predictable effect-the\n\
    undermining of trust in science.</p>\n\n\
    <p>We will never go back to the days when science was the new religion, and\n\
    men in white coats were expected to cure all the ills of the world. Nor\n\
    should we. Reverence for authority should always be tempered, and no\n\
    institution or profession mucking about in the real world can remain on\n\
    a pedestal long. But by claiming the respect they deserve, and striving\n\
    to ensure they deserve it, science may be able to get the public trust\n\
    it needs to survive and prosper back.</p>\n"

  title: Corruption Is Never Harmless, in the Church or State
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 18:09:33
  content_markup: "<p>Corruption is the most serious moral scandal of our time. Why? Because\n\
    corruption is a double-edged sword, a moral evil that may turn one\n\
    chump\xE2\x80\x99s decision to bribe, extort or otherwise abuse his power for\n\
    personal gain into destruction of the very systems that order our\n\
    society and make this country great.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The abuse scandal in the Catholic Church is a classic case. The shocking\n\
    thing is not the existence of priests who rape children. Thousands of\n\
    years of historical records suggest that, sadly, there will always be\n\
    men like this. The greater crime continues to be the church\xE2\x80\x99s stubborn\n\
    refusal to own the problem and to take whatever remedial action is\n\
    necessary to comfort and compensate victims, to identify and punish\n\
    offenders and get them away from kids. The problem is the cover-up. As\n\
    the US newspaper <em>National Catholic Reporter</em> said recently about the\n\
    continuing crisis: \xE2\x80\x9CThis [is] not primarily a story of wayward priests\n\
    but of an uncannily consistent pattern by individual bishops. In nearly\n\
    every instance, bishops faced with accusations of child abuse denied\n\
    them, even as they shuffled priests to new parishes, even as they\n\
    covered up their own actions.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>The latest allegations of branch-stacking in the Victorian ALP have a\n\
    similar feel, right down to the flourish of hypocrisy that accompanies\n\
    corruption in the very institutions you\xE2\x80\x99d expect would revile it most. A\n\
    former staffer for federal and state Labor ministers has given an\n\
    insider\xE2\x80\x99s account &ndash; replete with shadowy fund-raising events and\n\
    non-fee-paying members recruited en masse &ndash; of how factional bosses\n\
    determine who will gain preselection in safe Labor seats.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The whistleblower\xE2\x80\x99s motives may not be pure (he only came forward after\n\
    payment for his branch-stacking was suspended) but that doesn\xE2\x80\x99t matter.\n\
    What matters is the party\xE2\x80\x99s persistent refusal to undertake the systemic\n\
    change its own experts said was necessary to fix the problem. As an\n\
    editorial in <em>The Age</em> put it: \xE2\x80\x9CThe cancerous effects on a party that\n\
    breaks its own rules and marginalises members were spelt out in 2002 by\n\
    Bob Hawke and Neville Wran but the branch stacking continued apace.\n\
    Despite two damning independent reports last year on the Brimbank\n\
    Council scandal in Victoria, the ALP\xE2\x80\x99s own internal review found little\n\
    of concern.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>What should we do? First, admit that corruption is like mosquitoes near\n\
    a swamp &ndash; inevitable. Human nature is flawed and, left untutored or\n\
    unattended, some people will ride roughshod over the rules and customs\n\
    that keep the rest of us in check. They will do so to enhance their own\n\
    power, wealth or influence and with scant regard to how their actions\n\
    affect others or the organisations they claim to serve.</p>\n\n\
    <p>To stop them hurting others and destroying the fabric of civil society,\n\
    we must build institutions that hope for the best but can weather the\n\
    worst. Institutions armed with systems to minimise, detect and expose\n\
    malfeasance by checking power and compelling transparency and\n\
    accountability. Such systems must be regularly reviewed and updated, so\n\
    just as the rogues learn them, the rules that govern play change.</p>\n\n\
    <p>One final observation. Corruption is a culture. It thrives on\n\
    insularity. I know someone who defends political corruption on grounds\n\
    that the efficiencies are necessary and the ends justify the means. She\n\
    seems to believe it, too, perhaps because I was the only person &ndash; or the\n\
    first for some time &ndash; to reply to such claims with widened eyes.</p>\n"

    men like this. The greater crime continues to be the church\xE2\x80\x99s stubborn\r\n\
    refusal to own the problem and to take whatever remedial action is\r\n\
    necessary to comfort and compensate victims, to identify and punish\r\n\
    offenders and get them away from kids. The problem is the cover-up. As\r\n\
    the US newspaper *National Catholic Reporter* said recently about the\r\n\
    continuing crisis: \xE2\x80\x9CThis [is] not primarily a story of wayward priests\r\n\
    but of an uncannily consistent pattern by individual bishops. In nearly\r\n\
    every instance, bishops faced with accusations of child abuse denied\r\n\
    them, even as they shuffled priests to new parishes, even as they\r\n\
    covered up their own actions.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The latest allegations of branch-stacking in the Victorian ALP have a\r\n\
    similar feel, right down to the flourish of hypocrisy that accompanies\r\n\
    corruption in the very institutions you\xE2\x80\x99d expect would revile it most. A\r\n\
    former staffer for federal and state Labor ministers has given an\r\n\
    insider\xE2\x80\x99s account - replete with shadowy fund-raising events and\r\n\
    non-fee-paying members recruited en masse - of how factional bosses\r\n\
    determine who will gain preselection in safe Labor seats.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The whistleblower\xE2\x80\x99s motives may not be pure (he only came forward after\r\n\
    payment for his branch-stacking was suspended) but that doesn\xE2\x80\x99t matter.\r\n\
    What matters is the party\xE2\x80\x99s persistent refusal to undertake the systemic\r\n\
    change its own experts said was necessary to fix the problem. As an\r\n\
    editorial in *The Age* put it: \xE2\x80\x9CThe cancerous effects on a party that\r\n\
    breaks its own rules and marginalises members were spelt out in 2002 by\r\n\
    Bob Hawke and Neville Wran but the branch stacking continued apace.\r\n\
    Despite two damning independent reports last year on the Brimbank\r\n\
    Council scandal in Victoria, the ALP\xE2\x80\x99s own internal review found little\r\n\
    of concern.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    What should we do? First, admit that corruption is like mosquitoes near\r\n\
    a swamp - inevitable. Human nature is flawed and, left untutored or\r\n\
    unattended, some people will ride roughshod over the rules and customs\r\n\
    that keep the rest of us in check. They will do so to enhance their own\r\n\
    power, wealth or influence and with scant regard to how their actions\r\n\
    affect others or the organisations they claim to serve.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    To stop them hurting others and destroying the fabric of civil society,\r\n\
    we must build institutions that hope for the best but can weather the\r\n\
    worst. Institutions armed with systems to minimise, detect and expose\r\n\
    malfeasance by checking power and compelling transparency and\r\n\
    accountability. Such systems must be regularly reviewed and updated, so\r\n\
    just as the rogues learn them, the rules that govern play change.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    One final observation. Corruption is a culture. It thrives on\r\n\
    insularity. I know someone who defends political corruption on grounds\r\n\
    that the efficiencies are necessary and the ends justify the means. She\r\n\
    seems to believe it, too, perhaps because I was the only person - or the\r\n\
    first for some time - to reply to such claims with widened eyes."

    <p>Campbell\xE2\x80\x99s apology was reminiscent of that made by golfer Tiger Woods in\n\
    February. When Wood\xE2\x80\x99s extra-marital affairs were exposed in the media,\n\
    he held a press conference to beg forgiveness not just from his wife\n\
    Elin, but from everyone else, too:</p>\n\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CI was unfaithful, I had affairs and I cheated\xE2\x80\xA6I hurt my wife, my kids,\n\

    around the world who admired me\xE2\x80\xA6\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Of course, Tiger comes from the land of the prostrate mea culpa. When\n\
    South Carolina governor Mark Sanford held a news conference in June last\n\
    year to reveal details about his extra-marital affair-the details of\n\
    which had been known to his family for months-few were left off the list\n\
    of wounded. Sanford begged forgiveness from his wife, his four boys and\n\
    the state of South Carolina. \xE2\x80\x9CI have been unfaithful to my wife\xE2\x80\xA6I hurt\n\
    you all. I hurt my wife. I hurt my boys.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>It makes me want to hit someone. An extra-marital affair breaches the\n\
    explicit promise most couples make when they wed to be sexually\n\
    exclusive. Spouses who\xE2\x80\x99ve been cheated on feel, and have every right to\n\
    feel, betrayed and deceived, not just about the affair itself, but the\n\
    lying that tends to go on to keep it under wraps.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But what does infidelity in someone else\xE2\x80\x99s marriage have to do with me?\n\
    Why does a man I don\xE2\x80\x99t even know, a man who never made any commitments\n\
    to me one way or another about the post-marital whereabouts of his\n\
    pecker, owe me an explanation, little less a mea culpa, when he sleeps\n\
    around? In what way could I have understood his decision to play\n\
    professional sport, or to represent me in parliament, as a solemn vow to\n\
    me that he\xE2\x80\x99d be faithful to her? Why would I even care?</p>\n\n\
    <p>I do care, of course, but for all the wrong reasons. I care because\n\
    other people\xE2\x80\x99s dirty linen is compelling. I care because I am human and\n\
    humans are pack animals, forever compelled to see how our own lives\n\
    measure up against leading others. I care because I am occasionally\n\
    smart enough to want to learn from the mistakes of others, rather than\n\
    my own, and in matters of the heart the best way to do this is to stick\n\
    my beak in where it doesn\xE2\x80\x99t belong.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But interested or not, it seems far-fetched-preposterous even-to suggest\n\
    that who a famous person pokes is my concern. That all high-profile\n\
    adulterers owe me the who, what, when and where of all non-missionary\n\
    aspects of their sexual activity, not to mention a lavish apology\n\
    whenever that behaviour fails to measure up to a set of rigid Christian\n\
    standards to which I don\xE2\x80\x99t even subscribe. In what way is my life\n\
    altered by Campbell\xE2\x80\x99s, Wood\xE2\x80\x99s or Sanford\xE2\x80\x99s adultery? On the basis of\n\

    <p>The stocks and pillory brigade say it\xE2\x80\x99s not about the affair per se, but\n\

  title: The Patenting of Human Genes Must Be Stopped
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 18:09:21
  content_markup: "<p>Craig Venter is back in the news. The entrepreneurial geneticist\n\
    recently announced he has created a new form of synthetic life. The new\n\
    microbe, which thrives and replicates with only a man-made genome, paves\n\
    the way for a world full of organisms that are built to order rather\n\
    than evolved.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The technique, reported in the peer-reviewed journal <em>Science</em>, required\n\
    20 scientists, ten years and $USD40 million to develop. ExxonMobil,\n\
    however, has already placed an order with the J Craig Venter Institute\n\
    for an algae that can convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into\n\
    fuel, taking estimates of value into the trillions.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So far, concerns about the development by ethicists and religionists\n\
    have been predictable, and largely miss the point. Yes, there are risks\n\
    the organism could jump the lab, but Venter has inserted what he says\n\
    are fail-safe mechanisms into the microbe to render it harmless in the\n\
    outside world. All scientific inquiry entails some risk. The question is\n\
    whether those risks can be managed and are worth taking given the\n\
    possible benefits.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It is also true that Venter\xE2\x80\x99s contribution allows humans to play God,\n\
    but surely this is what humans have long sought to do. How else can we\n\
    understand humankind\xE2\x80\x99s attempts to predict earthquakes or vaccinate\n\
    against diseases than a spirited attempt to control and influence the\n\
    vagaries of the natural &ndash; or God given &ndash; world?</p>\n\n\
    <p>The real problems posed by the Venter development are the stale legal\n\
    and policy frameworks governing the world into which it\xE2\x80\x99s been birthed.\n\
    Venter makes much of the \xE2\x80\x9Csocietal good\xE2\x80\x9D he believes will come of what\n\
    he describes as \xE2\x80\x9Cone of the most powerful technologies and industrial\n\
    drivers\xE2\x80\x9D. He says he is concerned that the applications of his work are\n\
    used \xE2\x80\x9Cfor the benefit of all\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Maybe. But in a world where key features of modern day patent law date\n\
    back to the 1600\xE2\x80\x99s, and permit individuals or corporations to lock up\n\
    scientific knowledge as a source of private profit, consideration of the\n\
    public good remains optional.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Ventor\xE2\x80\x99s history suggests a keen interest in making knowledge critical\n\
    to public health private intellectual property. His man-made microbe\n\
    contains watermarks, five amino acid codes, that include quotations, an\n\
    email address and the names of people involved in the \xC2\xA330million project\n\
    (Dr Frankenstein not included).</p>\n\n\
    <p>In the 1990s, his former company Celera Genomics raced against a\n\
    publicly funded project to sequence the human genome. At the time, he\n\
    had already applied to control the intellectual rights on more than 300\n\
    genes.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Luckily, he lost. In 2000 then-US President Clinton and British Prime\n\
    Minister Tony Blair jointly announced that an international consortium\n\
    working cooperatively and funded by public monies had produced a rough\n\
    draft of the genome, which a White House press release said would \xE2\x80\x9Clead\n\
    to new ways to prevent, diagnose, treat and cure disease\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But we may not be so lucky next time, and this is the point. New areas\n\
    of science like genomics have long been outpacing the laws and policies\n\
    that seek to govern them. Legislators and regulators urgently need to\n\
    catch up.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Our view is that where existing research and intellectual property\n\
    frameworks are adequate to ensure that the building blocks of life &ndash;\n\
    whether evolved or created-remain in public hands, well and good.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But where such frameworks tilt towards handing any individual or\n\
    corporation sole ownership of knowledge, knowledge that belongs to and\n\
    can be used to benefit all of us, we have a problem. A problem most\n\
    recently seen in the shut down of research critical to discovering the\n\
    cures for diseases like autism, brain cancer and neurological disease by\n\
    StemCells Inc on the grounds that the researcher was using a technique\n\
    he had helped develop but they had patented.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Patents over genes, the building blocks of life or what Venter calls\n\
    \xE2\x80\x98DNA computer code,\xE2\x80\x99 are wrong. They are wrong in moral and in practical\n\
    terms. They are wrong because they allow individuals or corporations to\n\
    exclusively control information that belongs to all of us, and wrong\n\
    because their patents discourage scientific progress or reserve its\n\
    benefits to those who can pay.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This view is shared by Nobel prize winners Joseph Stiglitz and John\n\
    Sulston, who recently argued in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> that gene\n\
    patents, \xE2\x80\x9Cnot only prevent the use of knowledge in ways that would most\n\
    benefit society, they may even impede scientific progress. Every\n\
    scientific advance is built on those that came before it. There is still\n\
    a great deal to learn about our genes, particularly how they contribute\n\
    to disease. Gene patents inhibit access to the most basic information\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Venter\xE2\x80\x99s synthetic life form only adds weight to the passionate claims\n\
    from medical associations, geneticists, patients and academics have been\n\
    making for years that the patenting of human genes is unproductive and\n\
    unfair and must be stopped.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Next month a long-awaited report from the Australian Senate into the\n\
    impact of the granting of patents over human and microbial genes will be\n\
    handed down. Australian lawmakers must not miss this critical\n\
    opportunity to ensure that this country\xE2\x80\x99s regulatory framework places\n\
    the health and wellbeing of the Australian people and Australian\n\
    environment above private profit.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Scientific knowledge of evolved and created life must remain in public\n\
    hands.</p>\n\n\

    \r\n\
    It is also true that Venter\xE2\x80\x99s contribution allows humans to play God,\r\n\
    but surely this is what humans have long sought to do. How else can we\r\n\
    understand humankind\xE2\x80\x99s attempts to predict earthquakes or vaccinate\r\n\
    against diseases than a spirited attempt to control and influence the\r\n\
    vagaries of the natural - or God given - world?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The real problems posed by the Venter development are the stale legal\r\n\
    and policy frameworks governing the world into which it\xE2\x80\x99s been birthed.\r\n\
    Venter makes much of the \xE2\x80\x9Csocietal good\xE2\x80\x9D he believes will come of what\r\n\
    he describes as \xE2\x80\x9Cone of the most powerful technologies and industrial\r\n\
    drivers\xE2\x80\x9D. He says he is concerned that the applications of his work are\r\n\
    used \xE2\x80\x9Cfor the benefit of all\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Maybe. But in a world where key features of modern day patent law date\r\n\
    back to the 1600\xE2\x80\x99s, and permit individuals or corporations to lock up\r\n\
    scientific knowledge as a source of private profit, consideration of the\r\n\
    public good remains optional.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Ventor\xE2\x80\x99s history suggests a keen interest in making knowledge critical\r\n\
    to public health private intellectual property. His man-made microbe\r\n\
    contains watermarks, five amino acid codes, that include quotations, an\r\n\
    email address and the names of people involved in the \xC2\xA330million project\r\n\
    (Dr Frankenstein not included).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In the 1990s, his former company Celera Genomics raced against a\r\n\
    publicly funded project to sequence the human genome. At the time, he\r\n\
    had already applied to control the intellectual rights on more than 300\r\n\
    genes.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Luckily, he lost. In 2000 then-US President Clinton and British Prime\r\n\
    Minister Tony Blair jointly announced that an international consortium\r\n\
    working cooperatively and funded by public monies had produced a rough\r\n\
    draft of the genome, which a White House press release said would \xE2\x80\x9Clead\r\n\
    to new ways to prevent, diagnose, treat and cure disease\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But we may not be so lucky next time, and this is the point. New areas\r\n\
    of science like genomics have long been outpacing the laws and policies\r\n\
    that seek to govern them. Legislators and regulators urgently need to\r\n\
    catch up.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Our view is that where existing research and intellectual property\r\n\
    frameworks are adequate to ensure that the building blocks of life -\r\n\
    whether evolved or created-remain in public hands, well and good.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But where such frameworks tilt towards handing any individual or\r\n\
    corporation sole ownership of knowledge, knowledge that belongs to and\r\n\
    can be used to benefit all of us, we have a problem. A problem most\r\n\
    recently seen in the shut down of research critical to discovering the\r\n\
    cures for diseases like autism, brain cancer and neurological disease by\r\n\
    StemCells Inc on the grounds that the researcher was using a technique\r\n\
    he had helped develop but they had patented.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Patents over genes, the building blocks of life or what Venter calls\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x98DNA computer code,\xE2\x80\x99 are wrong. They are wrong in moral and in practical\r\n\
    terms. They are wrong because they allow individuals or corporations to\r\n\
    exclusively control information that belongs to all of us, and wrong\r\n\
    because their patents discourage scientific progress or reserve its\r\n\
    benefits to those who can pay.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This view is shared by Nobel prize winners Joseph Stiglitz and John\r\n\
    Sulston, who recently argued in *The Wall Street Journal* that gene\r\n\
    patents, \xE2\x80\x9Cnot only prevent the use of knowledge in ways that would most\r\n\
    benefit society, they may even impede scientific progress. Every\r\n\
    scientific advance is built on those that came before it. There is still\r\n\
    a great deal to learn about our genes, particularly how they contribute\r\n\
    to disease. Gene patents inhibit access to the most basic information\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Venter\xE2\x80\x99s synthetic life form only adds weight to the passionate claims\r\n\
    from medical associations, geneticists, patients and academics have been\r\n\
    making for years that the patenting of human genes is unproductive and\r\n\
    unfair and must be stopped.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Next month a long-awaited report from the Australian Senate into the\r\n\
    impact of the granting of patents over human and microbial genes will be\r\n\
    handed down. Australian lawmakers must not miss this critical\r\n\
    opportunity to ensure that this country\xE2\x80\x99s regulatory framework places\r\n\
    the health and wellbeing of the Australian people and Australian\r\n\
    environment above private profit.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Scientific knowledge of evolved and created life must remain in public\r\n\
    hands.\r\n\

    Flibanserin, improves hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or low libido.\n\
    The company says the condition affects one in 10 women.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Flibanserin began life as an antidepressant but wasn\xE2\x80\x99t much chop. But\n\
    during its trials some women reported sexual benefits. Boehringer looked\n\
    further. It now claims that 50 per cent of women with low desire who\n\

    <p>This outcome compares favourably with results reported for Europe, where\n\

    <p>So does the drug work? Who knows? All we\xE2\x80\x99ve got so far is Boehringer\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    claims, which has only presented the contradictory findings of its\n\
    studies &ndash; ones it has funded and conducted itself &ndash; in the highly\n\
    abbreviated form of conference abstracts. No independent evaluations of\n\
    either the drug\xE2\x80\x99s safety or efficacy have been undertaken and no reports\n\
    of the trials have appeared in journals. But the bigger problem with\n\
    Flibanserin is that independent experts are unsure that the condition it\n\
    claims to treat &ndash; hypoactive sexual desire disorder &ndash; actually exists.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Men want sex often and intensely. Barring erectile problems, their\n\
    desire leads to arousal and then to orgasm in a nice, linear fashion.\n\
    Women\xE2\x80\x99s sexual response &ndash; and I\xE2\x80\x99m sure I\xE2\x80\x99m not telling you anything here\n\

    <p>For women, arousal may be necessary for desire but not sufficient.\n\
    Sometimes, women won\xE2\x80\x99t want sex until they\xE2\x80\x99ve started having it and many\n\
    enjoy sex without orgasming. Being desired exclusively seems to be key\n\
    to female libido, which may explain why relationships initially arouse\n\
    women but cease to do so as time goes on. Indeed, while men tend to find\n\
    their partners more desirable over time, women often need a new partner\n\
    to rekindle desire.</p>\n\n\
    <p>All this raises the obvious question about whether low libido in women\n\

    men\xE2\x80\x99s? Indeed, even if we accept that marital disharmony resulting from\n\
    mismatched desires for sex is a problem in need of address, is a pill\n\
    really the answer? And if it is, why medicate women? Why not give men a\n\
    drug to settle them down?</p>\n\n\

  title: Tony Abbott Has a Poor Track Record on Respecting Medical Privacy for Teens
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 18:03:35
  content_markup: "<p>A recent legal case in Melbourne, combined with the increased likelihood\n\
    of an Abbott prime ministership, has resurrected fears about young\n\
    people\xE2\x80\x99s medical privacy.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Seventeen-year-old \xE2\x80\x9CShannon\xE2\x80\x9D sought support from a counsellor for issues\n\
    arising from domestic violence and her mother and stepfather\xE2\x80\x99s mental\n\
    illness. Without Shannon\xE2\x80\x99s consent or knowledge, the counsellor\n\
    disclosed her confidences to family members and those living with her in\n\
    supported accommodation.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The privacy breach, discussed at length in a recent episode of ABC\n\
    Radio\xE2\x80\x99s The Law Report, brought Shannon\xE2\x80\x99s already fragile life undone.\n\
    She is no longer on speaking terms with any family members, and is\n\
    terrified of confiding in any members of the helping professions whose\n\
    support and comfort she arguably needs.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In the words of the solicitor from the Youth Law Legal Service in\n\
    Melbourne who obtained both an apology and compensation for the young\n\
    girl, the professional\xE2\x80\x99s breach of her privacy caused her\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Csevere\xE2\x80\xA6trauma\xE2\x80\xA6and upset.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Health professionals and their professional bodies agree that privacy is\n\
    a critical component of effective healthcare for adolescents. Even\n\
    Francis Sullivan, the former CEO of Catholic Health Australia, an\n\
    industry body not known for its emphasis on patient rights where these\n\
    conflict with Catholic teachings, has noted that non-consensual\n\
    disclosure of young people\xE2\x80\x99s healthcare information risks exacerbating\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\xA6the very causes that led some teenagers to seek help outside the\n\
    family.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>At the heart of the near-universal support for adolescent health privacy\n\
    is an extensive body of data. The research shows that the greatest\n\
    barrier to young people seeking medical help is the fear their parents\n\
    may find out.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The converse is also true. \xE2\x80\x9CYoung people are more willing to disclose\n\
    sensitive personal information and return for follow-up care,\xE2\x80\x9D says\n\
    Professor Susan Sawyer, director of the Centre for Adolescent Health at\n\
    the Royal Children\xE2\x80\x99s Hospital, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen services are known to be\n\
    confidential.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>In Australia, \xE2\x80\x9Cmature minors\xE2\x80\x9D are authorised to make decisions about\n\
    their medical treatment. A mature minor is a tween or teen with\n\
    sufficient understanding and intelligence to understand the nature and\n\
    consequences of the medical intervention proposed, and to give informed\n\
    consent to it.</p>\n\n\
    <p>While all those under 18 must be accessed on such criteria, it is\n\
    generally assumed that those over 17 are mature minors, that those 14 to\n\
    16 are reasonably likely to be, and that those under 14 may not have\n\
    capacity to consent, particularly in relation to more serious\n\
    treatments. The requirement for confidentiality is a corollary of the\n\
    mature minor framework.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Never one to let evidence muddy the waters of ideology, the now\n\
    Opposition leader Tony Abbott was part of a government that in 2003\n\
    lifted the age at which information about a child\xE2\x80\x99s healthcare visits\n\
    could be accessed by their parents from 12 to 14. As Health Minister he\n\
    vigorously argued for this threshold to be lifted again, from 14 to 16.\n\
    Had he succeeded, an entire group of Australians would have been denied\n\
    independent and confidential medical care, despite most qualifying for\n\
    it.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Luckily, Abbott failed. But his vigorous pursuit of the change reveal\n\
    much about the values and priorities of the man polls tell us is most\n\
    likely to be Australia\xE2\x80\x99s next Prime Minister.</p>\n\n\
    <p>For Abbott, the right of parents to know what doctors their kids are\n\
    visiting and when takes priority over the right of that \xE2\x80\x9Cchild\xE2\x80\x9D &ndash; the\n\
    term he diligently applies to 14 and 15 year olds &ndash; to privacy.</p>\n\n\
    <p>While conceding that some 14 and 15-year-olds might \xE2\x80\x9Cwish to conceal\n\
    from their parents\xE2\x80\x9D the medical procedures they have had or the\n\
    prescription drugs they are on, he contends that \xE2\x80\x9Cchildren should not be\n\
    presumed to be the best judges of their own long-term interests and\n\
    should not have the right to go behind their parents\xE2\x80\x99 backs.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>When parents and children are at odds, says Abbott, \xE2\x80\x9Cthe responsibility\n\
    of government &ndash; and doctors &ndash; is to support parental authority.\xE2\x80\x9D This is\n\
    because adolescents can\xE2\x80\x99t act in their own best interests and so require\n\
    adults to make their decisions, and \xE2\x80\x9Cjudgmental parents\xE2\x80\x9D should not be\n\
    assumed to be capable of inflicting more harm on their children than\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cpermissive doctors.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>It is noteworthy that the \xE2\x80\x9Cchildren\xE2\x80\x9D to whom Abbott refers are largely\n\
    young women. Both logic and anecdotal evidence suggest that young men\n\
    have less need of medical advice, and fewer privacy concerns. \xE2\x80\x9CGuys\n\
    don\xE2\x80\x99t have as much to worry about,\xE2\x80\x9D one 16 year old girl told <em>The\n\
    Canberra Times</em>. \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\xA6 they can\xE2\x80\x99t get pregnant.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>In a final and characteristically clueless fiscal flourish, Abbott notes\n\
    that giving parents the power to purvey their (mostly daughters\xE2\x80\x99)\n\
    medical records was really not that much power at all. He scoffs at the\n\
    claim that such privacy invasions might cash out in suicide or backyard\n\
    abortion because \xE2\x80\x9CThe worst that might happen is a teenager accessing a\n\
    service but not claiming a rebate.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>What is she going to pay medical bills or script costs worth hundreds of\n\
    dollars with, Tony? Her parentally-controlled trust fund? Grandma\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    backyard stash?</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Liberals are doing their best to keep Autocratic Abbott under wraps,\n\
    and to repair Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s relations with women (he breakfasted not long ago\n\
    with feminist blogger Mia Freedman). I suspect he\xE2\x80\x99s also been out\n\
    mending fences with others in the community who have memories better\n\
    than goldfish about life under Abbott and Howard.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I\xE2\x80\x99m having none of it. Leopards don\xE2\x80\x99t change their spots. Tony Abbott is\n\
    still the Mad Monk or, as his daughter put it, \xE2\x80\x9Ca lame\xE2\x80\xA6 churchy loser.\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    If he comes to power, the Christian right will still have his ear and\n\
    just as it was in the past, women, gays, single mothers, young people,\n\
    Aborigines, religious minorities, migrants and those with the audacity\n\
    to be disabled or unemployed will need to watch out.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Labor needs to stop making elliptical references to the nightmare of an\n\
    Abbott-led government and start spelling out exactly whose rights are\n\
    likely to cancelled, and whose best interests will be decided by others.</p>\n\n\
    <p>They need to explain not just what an Abbott-led Liberal government is\n\
    likely to mean for \xE2\x80\x9Cworking families\xE2\x80\x9D and unionists, but the impact it\n\
    would have on the rights, privacy and freedoms of all of us.</p>\n"

  title: Protect Our Kids from Scripture Teachers and Junk Food Advertisers
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 18:11:25
  content_markup: "<p><em>It\xE2\x80\x99s easy taking candy from a baby. That doesn\xE2\x80\x99t make it right.</em></p>\n\n\
    <p>This is James, a NSW scripture teacher: \xE2\x80\x9CThe great opportunity we have\n\
    in teaching scripture in our primary schools \xE2\x80\xA6 is that we\xE2\x80\x99re allowed to\n\
    teach it up to an hour a week \xE2\x80\xA6 I spoke to a \xE2\x80\xA6 student \xE2\x80\xA6 and I said:\n\
    \xE2\x80\x98Did you know that God loves you?\xE2\x80\x99 and he said: \xE2\x80\x98No I didn\xE2\x80\x99t.\xE2\x80\x99 Then I\n\
    went through John 3:16 and asked him if he\xE2\x80\x98d ever heard that before and\n\
    he said \xE2\x80\x99No.\xE2\x80\x99 And it shocked me [that] \xE2\x80\xA6 this boy didn\xE2\x80\x99t even know that\n\
    his creator loved him and cared about him \xE2\x80\xA6 and sent him the Lord Jesus.\n\
    The challenge is before us to capture the hearts and minds of children\n\
    and youth, to talk about Jesus in the scripture classes \xE2\x80\xA6\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>This is Janet. She works for YouthWorks. Here\xE2\x80\x99s how she advised her\n\
    fellow scripture teachers to defend against the \xE2\x80\x9Cthreat\xE2\x80\x9D posed by ethics\n\
    classes being available to primary kids whose parents opt them out of\n\
    religious education:</p>\n\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CIn the younger years we need to sow the seeds strongly of the gospel\n\
    and scripture. Get the Bible into people\xE2\x80\x99s homes or parts of the Bible \xE2\x80\xA6\n\
    Get scripture into people\xE2\x80\x99s homes, so that by the time [kids] are in\n\
    year 6 they\xE2\x80\x99ve had a strong grounding in what the gospel is all about\n\
    and they won\xE2\x80\x99t be so easily falling for the ethics material.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>This is Health Minister Nicola Roxon, who earlier this year rejected the\n\
    findings of the government\xE2\x80\x99s own preventive health taskforce to regulate\n\
    the volume and types of advertising directed at young children.\\\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CWhile the government is supportive of limiting the exposure of children\n\
    to advertising that may unduly influence them, the government will not\n\
    consider regulatory action at this time.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Adults are confused. Confused not so much as to the special\n\
    vulnerability of young children to adult attempts to influence them (my\n\
    reading of the above quotes suggest they understand this very well), but\n\
    confused as to what this vulnerability demands of the grown-ups who are\n\
    in a position to influence children, particularly if they hold positions\n\
    of authority.</p>\n\n\
    <p>If only influence-peddlers would self-regulate. If only they were the\n\
    sort of people who, however much they stood to gain financially or\n\
    however worthy they thought their message, would never take advantage of\n\
    a child\xE2\x80\x99s innocence to clinch a sale.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Don\xE2\x80\x99t hold your breath. YouthWorks\xE2\x80\x99 advice to religious education\n\
    teachers to hit six-year-olds hard to defend against later parental\n\
    decisions to opt their kids out of religious education is risible.\n\
    Australian industry is no better, with self-regulation having led to\n\
    nothing more than a marked increase in food marketing to kids.\\\n\
    Parents are often lambasted for not shielding their offspring from such\n\
    unfair influence but children\xE2\x80\x99s ads come via the net, TV, Facebook,\n\
    email and mobile phones. Without umbilical attachment, no parent can\n\
    defend against this, which may be why 91 per cent of consumers in a 2008\n\

    \r\n\
    This is James, a NSW scripture teacher: \xE2\x80\x9CThe great opportunity we have\r\n\
    in teaching scripture in our primary schools \xE2\x80\xA6 is that we\xE2\x80\x99re allowed to\r\n\
    teach it up to an hour a week \xE2\x80\xA6 I spoke to a \xE2\x80\xA6 student \xE2\x80\xA6 and I said:\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x98Did you know that God loves you?\xE2\x80\x99 and he said: \xE2\x80\x98No I didn\xE2\x80\x99t.\xE2\x80\x99 Then I\r\n\
    went through John 3:16 and asked him if he\xE2\x80\x98d ever heard that before and\r\n\
    he said \xE2\x80\x99No.\xE2\x80\x99 And it shocked me [that] \xE2\x80\xA6 this boy didn\xE2\x80\x99t even know that\r\n\
    his creator loved him and cared about him \xE2\x80\xA6 and sent him the Lord Jesus.\r\n\
    The challenge is before us to capture the hearts and minds of children\r\n\
    and youth, to talk about Jesus in the scripture classes \xE2\x80\xA6\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This is Janet. She works for YouthWorks. Here\xE2\x80\x99s how she advised her\r\n\
    fellow scripture teachers to defend against the \xE2\x80\x9Cthreat\xE2\x80\x9D posed by ethics\r\n\
    classes being available to primary kids whose parents opt them out of\r\n\
    religious education:\r\n\
    \r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CIn the younger years we need to sow the seeds strongly of the gospel\r\n\
    and scripture. Get the Bible into people\xE2\x80\x99s homes or parts of the Bible \xE2\x80\xA6\r\n\
    Get scripture into people\xE2\x80\x99s homes, so that by the time [kids] are in\r\n\
    year 6 they\xE2\x80\x99ve had a strong grounding in what the gospel is all about\r\n\
    and they won\xE2\x80\x99t be so easily falling for the ethics material.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This is Health Minister Nicola Roxon, who earlier this year rejected the\r\n\
    findings of the government\xE2\x80\x99s own preventive health taskforce to regulate\r\n\
    the volume and types of advertising directed at young children.\\\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CWhile the government is supportive of limiting the exposure of children\r\n\
    to advertising that may unduly influence them, the government will not\r\n\
    consider regulatory action at this time.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Adults are confused. Confused not so much as to the special\r\n\
    vulnerability of young children to adult attempts to influence them (my\r\n\
    reading of the above quotes suggest they understand this very well), but\r\n\
    confused as to what this vulnerability demands of the grown-ups who are\r\n\
    in a position to influence children, particularly if they hold positions\r\n\
    of authority.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    If only influence-peddlers would self-regulate. If only they were the\r\n\
    sort of people who, however much they stood to gain financially or\r\n\
    however worthy they thought their message, would never take advantage of\r\n\
    a child\xE2\x80\x99s innocence to clinch a sale.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Don\xE2\x80\x99t hold your breath. YouthWorks\xE2\x80\x99 advice to religious education\r\n\
    teachers to hit six-year-olds hard to defend against later parental\r\n\
    decisions to opt their kids out of religious education is risible.\r\n\
    Australian industry is no better, with self-regulation having led to\r\n\
    nothing more than a marked increase in food marketing to kids.\\\r\n\
    Parents are often lambasted for not shielding their offspring from such\r\n\
    unfair influence but children\xE2\x80\x99s ads come via the net, TV, Facebook,\r\n\
    email and mobile phones. Without umbilical attachment, no parent can\r\n\
    defend against this, which may be why 91 per cent of consumers in a 2008\r\n\
    survey supported stronger government action.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Children are easily misled. They lack the cognitive skills and abilities\r\n\
    to \xE2\x80\x9Cread\xE2\x80\x9D persuasive messages, whether these come at them in the\r\n\
    classroom, or via a screen. From ages six to seven, kids think ads offer\r\n\
    information, while those aged seven to eight can\xE2\x80\x99t discern the\r\n\
    difference between information and the intent of an ad to persuade. By\r\n\
    ages 10 to 12, most kids are still unable to identify the sales\r\n\
    techniques being used to get them to say, \xE2\x80\x9Cyes\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    That we know this and don\xE2\x80\x99t stop the influence-peddlers taking candy\r\n\
    from our babies should shame us all."

    <p>The consistent visibility of Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s beliefs reassures us. It promises\n\
    certainty with regard to the direction he would take the country. This\n\
    is not just because such values direct some choices while prohibiting\n\
    others but because, having held fast to these values for so long, we\n\
    feel he won\xE2\x80\x99t relinquish them easily. When challenged by economic hard\n\
    times, boisterous community groups or international recalcitrance, we\n\
    see Tony Abbott as someone who will fight for his beliefs, not cut and\n\
    run.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s strength is also his weakness. This is for the simple\n\
    reason that his strongly held moral values are an anathema to most of\n\
    us. For instance, reputable polls show that around 80 per cent of\n\
    Australians support legal abortion, stem cell research and voluntary\n\
    euthanasia. So, too, do we know that the economic agenda of the big\n\
    business leaders who have his ear will leave most of us &ndash; and the public\n\
    institutions and infrastructure on which we rely &ndash; worse off.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The Prime Minister\xE2\x80\x99s problem is different. As personable as Abbott &ndash;\n\
    when in \xE2\x80\x9Creal Julia\xE2\x80\x9D mode, anyway &ndash; she remains a lesser-known quantity.\n\
    Where she has distinguished herself, or been noted by others, it is most\n\
    often for matters of form, not substance. She seems smart and\n\
    articulate, yet we have little sense of what direction she\xE2\x80\x99ll steer the\n\
    country because we don\xE2\x80\x99t know the things that really matter to her &ndash;\n\
    what she\xE2\x80\x99ll fight for and never compromise on, no matter what.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Gillard rarely discusses the things she believes in. Because of this, we\n\
    tend to assume. We assume that because she has a working class\n\
    background and made education the centrepiece of her parliamentary\n\
    maiden speech that she favours a first class public education system.\n\
    Having bravely asserted her lack of faith in God, we assume she will\n\
    defend the barrier between church and state. Because she is Australia\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    first female PM, we think she\xE2\x80\x99ll stand and fight for the policies women\n\
    need to succeed.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But we are often proved wrong. In her short time in the top job Gillard\n\
    has refused to alter the way government funds state and private schools\n\
    and has expanded the school Christian chaplaincy program by a third. She\n\
    opposes gay marriage and was the strongest opponent in Rudd\xE2\x80\x99s kitchen\n\
    cabinet of the miserly paid parental leave scheme Australian feminists\n\
    battled for decades to achieve.</p>\n\n\
    <p>To make matters more confusing, when Gillard moves against what we\n\
    thought she\xE2\x80\x99d defend, she tends to laud her stance as proof of her\n\
    metal. The MySchools website is a textbook case, though what she expects\n\
    us to draw from it is anyone\xE2\x80\x99s guess. Does she view her willingness to\n\
    screw an expected adversary &ndash; in this case, the education union &ndash; as\n\
    proof of a practical even-handedness that she sees as the essence of her\n\
    character? Or is this dispassionate judicial-like persona, concerned\n\
    with formal process rather than substance, all she is willing to share\n\
    with us, preferring to keep private the aspects of her character that\n\
    would reveal her policy preferences and her heart.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Whatever is the case, the real problem is that Labor\xE2\x80\x99s tactics have\n\
    undermined any claim to evidence-based policy at every turn. Whether\n\
    it\xE2\x80\x99s setting aside the Henry Tax Review to placate West Australian\n\
    miners, or pre-empting its own assessment of the National School\n\
    Chaplaincy Program to expand it by a third or proposing a citizens\n\
    assembly to address the science of climate change, Labor has done little\n\
    more than hand out taxpayer funds to marginal electorates or interest\n\
    groups that scream the loudest throughout the campaign. And since week\n\
    three, when Gillard shook of the shackles of Labor\xE2\x80\x99s election\n\
    strategists, she has been in charge and doing it her way.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Having said this, Abbott also seems determined to undermine his own\n\
    strengths on the character front. Avoiding press forums that might see\n\
    him go off message, he looks at times to be visibly straining on his\n\
    lead. While his pounding of the \xE2\x80\x9Cno means no\xE2\x80\x9D mantra in response to\n\
    Gillard\xE2\x80\x99s request for a debate was widely lauded as a blunder, I suspect\n\
    it did him good. It affirmed that, despite the muzzling, he remains the\n\
    same man: oblivious to a feminist anti-rape slogan familiar to many\n\
    12-year-olds, and one sincere in his illogical assertion that men with\n\
    daughters can\xE2\x80\x99t be sexist.</p>\n\n\
    <p>There is something dispiriting about watching people we call leaders try\n\

    vote for a man who strongly believes in what\xE2\x80\x99s awful, or for a woman who\r\n\
    believes in nothing except getting herself elected?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The conundrum exposes the two central items on our wishlist for\r\n\
    political leaders: that they stand for something, and for something we\r\n\
    like.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Liberal Opposition Leader Tony Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s strength is his believability.\r\n\
    Having observed him for years as a high profile Howard government\r\n\
    minister, we trust that he is as he appears: a conservative Catholic man\r\n\
    guided in his political judgement by Vatican dictates on personal moral\r\n\
    issues like abortion, stem-cell research and euthanasia, and by small\r\n\
    government neo-liberal orthodoxy on much else.\r\n\

    Shorten, is a Labor MP likely to have a senior role in the Gillard\n\
    government if it retains power.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In response to the outcry, the Governor-General has sought legal advice\n\

    circumstances\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Instances of conflict of interest are recurring ethical and legal issues\n\

    <p>Conflicts are inevitable. Public officers have family, friends and\n\

    integrity of the decision, the office and the institutions of democratic\n\
    society generally.</p>\n\n\
    <p>What all this boils down to is a distinct set of propositions. First,\n\
    that having a conflict of interest isn\xE2\x80\x99t what makes you wrong, it\xE2\x80\x99s the\n\
    failure to address an actual or perceived one that\xE2\x80\x99s the problem.\n\

    <p>This second point, so misunderstood in the debate so far, is worth\n\

    <p>The general, rather than personal, nature of this question explains why\n\
    a person with conflicts cannot effectively redress them by swearing to\n\

  content_markup: "<p>The first problem with no name was uncovered in the 1960s by a feminist\n\
    named Betty Friedan. Once named, the problem had a chance of having its\n\
    parameters defined and negative consequences addressed.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Now, we are in the grip of another problem with no name. Yet the\n\
    evidence is everywhere that worthy individuals are strangling in its\n\
    grip and that in democratic societies the quality of public debate and\n\
    political decision-making is staggering under its weight.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The problem is a growing and collective regression in the way we decide\n\
    what is right and true, and, on the basis of this knowledge, how to act.</p>\n\n\
    <p>How did we decide in the past? Back in the day, people knew what was\n\
    true because they felt it in their bones or because their customs and\n\
    traditions spelt it out. Or they knew because powerful men in their\n\
    community who claimed to represent their chosen god, or gods, told them\n\
    or the local tribesmen commanded they understand it on pain of death.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Arguably, the march of Western nations through the enlightenment and\n\
    into the prosperity and social stability we enjoy today, has been the\n\
    result of new ways of knowing. Since the 18th century, decision-making\n\
    that involves persuasion by dispassionate rational argument and evidence\n\
    has been the rage.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But now, it seems, the titans of ignorance are struggling to reassert\n\
    command. To watch them in action, tune in to <em>Fox News</em> or shock-jock\n\
    radio or the comments section of any opinion website. What you\xE2\x80\x99ll find\n\
    there is more than evidence of the Dunning-Kruger effect or what\n\
    Bertrand Russell referred to as the certainty of the stupid. You\xE2\x80\x99ll also\n\

  content: "The first problem with no name was uncovered in the 1960s by a feminist\r\n\
    named Betty Friedan. Once named, the problem had a chance of having its\r\n\
    parameters defined and negative consequences addressed.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Now, we are in the grip of another problem with no name. Yet the\r\n\
    evidence is everywhere that worthy individuals are strangling in its\r\n\
    grip and that in democratic societies the quality of public debate and\r\n\
    political decision-making is staggering under its weight.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The problem is a growing and collective regression in the way we decide\r\n\
    what is right and true, and, on the basis of this knowledge, how to act.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    How did we decide in the past? Back in the day, people knew what was\r\n\
    true because they felt it in their bones or because their customs and\r\n\
    traditions spelt it out. Or they knew because powerful men in their\r\n\
    community who claimed to represent their chosen god, or gods, told them\r\n\
    or the local tribesmen commanded they understand it on pain of death.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Arguably, the march of Western nations through the enlightenment and\r\n\
    into the prosperity and social stability we enjoy today, has been the\r\n\
    result of new ways of knowing. Since the 18th century, decision-making\r\n\
    that involves persuasion by dispassionate rational argument and evidence\r\n\
    has been the rage.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But now, it seems, the titans of ignorance are struggling to reassert\r\n\
    command. To watch them in action, tune in to *Fox News* or shock-jock\r\n\
    radio or the comments section of any opinion website. What you\xE2\x80\x99ll find\r\n\
    there is more than evidence of the Dunning-Kruger effect or what\r\n\
    Bertrand Russell referred to as the certainty of the stupid. You\xE2\x80\x99ll also\r\n\
    witness what John Birmingham calls the toxic, self-defeating culture of\r\n\

  title: Talking About Rape
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 18:12:40
  content_markup: "<p>It\xE2\x80\x99s the end of the footy season, so everyone\xE2\x80\x99s talking about rape. Or,\n\
    more specifically, about the young women who were so stupid as to put\n\
    themselves in a position where they\xE2\x80\x99d be raped, or be able to claim\n\
    later that they were.</p>\n\n\
    <p>TV presenter Kerri-Anne Kennerley laid the blame on the \xE2\x80\x9Cstrays\xE2\x80\x9D who\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cthrow &hellip; themselves at sportspeople\xE2\x80\x9D. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat do [women] expect,\xE2\x80\x9D she\n\
    asked, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen they are out at night?\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Former AFL player Spida Everitt was also scathing about, \xE2\x80\x9CYet another .\n\
    . . girl making alleged allegations after she awoke with &hellip; an\n\
    alleged guilty conscience.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>I have been raped. Twice. The first time was my first time &ndash; I was 17 &ndash;\n\
    but I didn\xE2\x80\x99t think of it as rape. Not even when the nightmares began\n\
    and, following that, the depression.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I just thought I was a stupid girl who put myself in harm\xE2\x80\x99s way and got\n\
    what I deserved. Embarrassed at being so dumb, I told no one what\n\
    happened. It was only years later when I stubbed my toe and couldn\xE2\x80\x99t\n\
    stop crying that my mother strong-armed me into seeing a psychologist\n\
    and the story came out.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The second time was when an old boyfriend got my half-asleep roommate to\n\
    let him into the house in the middle of the night. I was in my room and\n\
    woke having sex. Surely this was a clear-cut case of rape but, again, I\n\
    didn\xE2\x80\x99t see it that way. Because now I was 21 and understood that you\n\
    can\xE2\x80\x99t thread a moving needle and I\xE2\x80\x99d had sex with him before so what was\n\
    the big deal and if I hadn\xE2\x80\x99t wanted it why didn\xE2\x80\x99t I scream?</p>\n\n\
    <p>In fact, what I did &ndash; then and later &ndash; was pretend everything was fine.\n\
    I acted like what happened was exactly what I chose to happen. I was not\n\
    prepared to contemplate the alternative framing of events and its\n\
    emotional corollary &ndash; that I\xE2\x80\x99d been raped again and this meant that I\n\
    wasn\xE2\x80\x99t safe anywhere, not even in my own bed.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I don\xE2\x80\x99t want pity. Indeed, it\xE2\x80\x99s fear of being seen as a victim that has\n\
    led me to keep my personal story quiet thus far. I tell it now to try to\n\
    inject the complex reality of sexual assault &ndash; how it happens and how\n\
    those who experience it attempt to get their heads around it &ndash; into the\n\
    public discussions we have most years at this time on the subject.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I also want to point to the contribution gender stereotypes make to the\n\
    problem. Like young women today, I was sold a double message. The\n\
    explicit one was that I was strong, capable and free to do what I chose\n\
    with my life and body &ndash; sexually and otherwise &ndash; and not be judged for\n\
    it.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The subterranean one was that if I acted as if I was entitled to be both\n\
    free and safe, and someone did hurt or rape me, it was my own stupid,\n\
    sluttish fault.</p>\n\n\
    <p>These contradictory messages have co-existed quietly in my psyche just\n\
    as they do for some young women today until the Kennerleys and Everitts\n\
    of the world lay them bare.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I laid my own demons to rest long ago. One thing that helped was the\n\
    acknowledgment by one of the men that something bad had happened and it\n\
    wasn\xE2\x80\x99t my fault. This was several years later and we were at a party. He\n\
    found me alone on the balcony and said this: \xE2\x80\x9CWhat happened &hellip; that\n\
    night. I didn\xE2\x80\x99t realise then but I do now. It wasn\xE2\x80\x99t right. I shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t\n\
    have done it.\xE2\x80\x9D I forgave him right then and there.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So where to now? Has increasing social and sexual freedom been good for\n\
    young women, or bad? The truth is that this is the wrong question to\n\
    ask. Equality and freedom are chances that some women will use poorly\n\
    and others well. Certainly every young woman, like every young man, will\n\
    make mistakes and get hurt. This is what coming of age is all about. The\n\
    hope is that as time moves on, and a critical number of generations\n\
    accumulate wisdom they can pass to their kids, the relative balance of\n\
    those who use their freedom wisely will grow.</p>\n\n\
    <p>For thousands of years, humans have lived in societies built on the\n\
    exercise of superior male strength and the inevitability of female\n\
    pregnancy. Inflexible and gender-inequitable rules for emotional and\n\
    physical engagement between the sexes arose from these realities.</p>\n\n\
    <p>As societies governed by the rule of law and populated by women with\n\
    access to reliable contraception become the norm, new rules of\n\
    engagement for relations between the sexes &ndash; ones based on mutual\n\
    understanding, respect and consent &ndash; will flourish.</p>\n\n\
    <p>There is no doubt that young men are changing. Many see women as their\n\
    equals, are well across the concept of consent and &ndash; in response to the\n\
    more assertive sexuality of their female peers &ndash; are interrogating the\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Creal men always want it\xE2\x80\x9D stereotype as a first step towards a \xE2\x80\x9Cno means\n\
    no\xE2\x80\x9D mantra of their own.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Similarly, we must recognise young women who report sexual assault as\n\
    canaries in the coalmine. It is they who are blazing the trail towards\n\
    the safe and equal world we want for our daughters and sons. This is\n\
    because, unlike me at that age, they don\xE2\x80\x99t have the words of Kennerley\n\
    or Everitt in their head.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Instead, they believe that, just like their male mates, they should be\n\
    free to party with abandon when their team wins the grand final. And be\n\
    safe while they do it.</p>\n"

  content: "It\xE2\x80\x99s the end of the footy season, so everyone\xE2\x80\x99s talking about rape. Or,\r\n\
    more specifically, about the young women who were so stupid as to put\r\n\
    themselves in a position where they\xE2\x80\x99d be raped, or be able to claim\r\n\
    later that they were.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    TV presenter Kerri-Anne Kennerley laid the blame on the \xE2\x80\x9Cstrays\xE2\x80\x9D who\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cthrow . . . themselves at sportspeople\xE2\x80\x9D. \xE2\x80\x9CWhat do [women] expect,\xE2\x80\x9D she\r\n\
    asked, \xE2\x80\x9Cwhen they are out at night?\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Former AFL player Spida Everitt was also scathing about, \xE2\x80\x9CYet another .\r\n\
    . . girl making alleged allegations after she awoke with . . . an\r\n\
    alleged guilty conscience.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I have been raped. Twice. The first time was my first time - I was 17 -\r\n\
    but I didn\xE2\x80\x99t think of it as rape. Not even when the nightmares began\r\n\
    and, following that, the depression.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I just thought I was a stupid girl who put myself in harm\xE2\x80\x99s way and got\r\n\
    what I deserved. Embarrassed at being so dumb, I told no one what\r\n\
    happened. It was only years later when I stubbed my toe and couldn\xE2\x80\x99t\r\n\
    stop crying that my mother strong-armed me into seeing a psychologist\r\n\
    and the story came out.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The second time was when an old boyfriend got my half-asleep roommate to\r\n\
    let him into the house in the middle of the night. I was in my room and\r\n\
    woke having sex. Surely this was a clear-cut case of rape but, again, I\r\n\
    didn\xE2\x80\x99t see it that way. Because now I was 21 and understood that you\r\n\
    can\xE2\x80\x99t thread a moving needle and I\xE2\x80\x99d had sex with him before so what was\r\n\
    the big deal and if I hadn\xE2\x80\x99t wanted it why didn\xE2\x80\x99t I scream?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    In fact, what I did - then and later - was pretend everything was fine.\r\n\
    I acted like what happened was exactly what I chose to happen. I was not\r\n\
    prepared to contemplate the alternative framing of events and its\r\n\
    emotional corollary - that I\xE2\x80\x99d been raped again and this meant that I\r\n\
    wasn\xE2\x80\x99t safe anywhere, not even in my own bed.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I don\xE2\x80\x99t want pity. Indeed, it\xE2\x80\x99s fear of being seen as a victim that has\r\n\
    led me to keep my personal story quiet thus far. I tell it now to try to\r\n\
    inject the complex reality of sexual assault - how it happens and how\r\n\
    those who experience it attempt to get their heads around it - into the\r\n\
    public discussions we have most years at this time on the subject.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I also want to point to the contribution gender stereotypes make to the\r\n\
    problem. Like young women today, I was sold a double message. The\r\n\
    explicit one was that I was strong, capable and free to do what I chose\r\n\
    with my life and body - sexually and otherwise - and not be judged for\r\n\
    it.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The subterranean one was that if I acted as if I was entitled to be both\r\n\
    free and safe, and someone did hurt or rape me, it was my own stupid,\r\n\
    sluttish fault.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    These contradictory messages have co-existed quietly in my psyche just\r\n\
    as they do for some young women today until the Kennerleys and Everitts\r\n\
    of the world lay them bare.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I laid my own demons to rest long ago. One thing that helped was the\r\n\
    acknowledgment by one of the men that something bad had happened and it\r\n\
    wasn\xE2\x80\x99t my fault. This was several years later and we were at a party. He\r\n\
    found me alone on the balcony and said this: \xE2\x80\x9CWhat happened . . . that\r\n\
    night. I didn\xE2\x80\x99t realise then but I do now. It wasn\xE2\x80\x99t right. I shouldn\xE2\x80\x99t\r\n\
    have done it.\xE2\x80\x9D I forgave him right then and there.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So where to now? Has increasing social and sexual freedom been good for\r\n\
    young women, or bad? The truth is that this is the wrong question to\r\n\
    ask. Equality and freedom are chances that some women will use poorly\r\n\
    and others well. Certainly every young woman, like every young man, will\r\n\
    make mistakes and get hurt. This is what coming of age is all about. The\r\n\
    hope is that as time moves on, and a critical number of generations\r\n\
    accumulate wisdom they can pass to their kids, the relative balance of\r\n\
    those who use their freedom wisely will grow.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    For thousands of years, humans have lived in societies built on the\r\n\
    exercise of superior male strength and the inevitability of female\r\n\
    pregnancy. Inflexible and gender-inequitable rules for emotional and\r\n\
    physical engagement between the sexes arose from these realities.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    As societies governed by the rule of law and populated by women with\r\n\
    access to reliable contraception become the norm, new rules of\r\n\
    engagement for relations between the sexes - ones based on mutual\r\n\
    understanding, respect and consent - will flourish.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    There is no doubt that young men are changing. Many see women as their\r\n\
    equals, are well across the concept of consent and - in response to the\r\n\
    more assertive sexuality of their female peers - are interrogating the\r\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Creal men always want it\xE2\x80\x9D stereotype as a first step towards a \xE2\x80\x9Cno means\r\n\
    no\xE2\x80\x9D mantra of their own.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Similarly, we must recognise young women who report sexual assault as\r\n\
    canaries in the coalmine. It is they who are blazing the trail towards\r\n\
    the safe and equal world we want for our daughters and sons. This is\r\n\
    because, unlike me at that age, they don\xE2\x80\x99t have the words of Kennerley\r\n\
    or Everitt in their head.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Instead, they believe that, just like their male mates, they should be\r\n\
    free to party with abandon when their team wins the grand final. And be\r\n\
    safe while they do it."

    This may be true but it\xE2\x80\x99s no excuse. Not for politicians and not for us,\r\n\

    A heartwarming addendum. Three days after this piece ran and during the\r\n\
    Victorian election campaign, the Labor Premier of Victoria John Brumby\r\n\

  title: Can Doctors Say No to Providing Abortion Care?

    <p>Despite the heartless and arrogant nature of such medical practice,\n\
    Catholic medical staff and institutions staunchly defend it, and dismiss\n\
    the suffering and loss of autonomy women endure as a result. In\n\
    Australia, where the state of Victoria recently passed an abortion law\n\
    that required refusing doctors to refer and to treat in a\n\
    life-threatening emergency, Catholic leaders slammed the new law as the\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cnastiest human rights abuse\xE2\x80\x9D. A group calling itself Doctors in\n\
    Conscience condemned the demand that religious doctors provide an\n\
    abortion where their refusal would see a woman die as ushering in \xE2\x80\x9Ca new\n\

    27-year-old mother of four staggered into a Catholic hospital in America\n\
    last November, 11 weeks pregnant and gravely ill, the doctors told her\n\
    that if she continued with the pregnancy her risk of mortality was\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cclose to 100%\xE2\x80\x9D. But when Sister Margaret McBride authorised the\n\
    abortion necessary to save the woman\xE2\x80\x99s life, she was sacked and\n\
    excommunicated. The priest heading up the hospital ethics committee\n\

    <p>This is not to say that morality precludes medical objectors from moving\n\

    also spell the end of small-l liberalism in Australia.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Who cares? To quote a tweet from feminist cartoonist Judy Horacek, many\n\
    of the progressive voters who share Baillieu\xE2\x80\x99s stance on matters of\n\

    <p>Well, they should care for the simple reason that the stance of the\n\

    their illiberal agenda.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The abortion debate in the state in 2008 is a case in point. As former\n\
    Victorian premier Joan Kirner has acknowledged, Baillieu played an\n\
    important role in the success of the decriminalisation push. He made his\n\
    intention to vote for reform early in the piece, and each time\n\
    conservative religious Liberals sought to derail the process, he put\n\
    them in their place. When Peter Costello tried to stir up community\n\
    disquiet about the legislation, Baillieu did what is all to too rare in\n\
    the male-dominated world of politics: he kept faith with his small-l\n\
    Liberal principles even when it came to women. He told The Age that\n\
    women deserved to be free to choose to have an abortion \xE2\x80\x9Cwithout fear of\n\
    unwarranted persecution, prosecution or stigma\xE2\x80\x9D, and added: \xE2\x80\x9CIt\xE2\x80\x99s time\n\
    to provide some certainty, and for the women of Victoria this is a very\n\
    important [time].\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>One has only to look at the inaction on law reform in Queensland and New\n\
    South Wales &ndash; states lumbered with the same antiquated and unclear\n\
    criminal provisions on abortion that reigned in Victoria &ndash; to recognise\n\
    the key role of a small-l Liberal opposition.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Even in Queensland, where last month a young woman and her boyfriend\n\
    were charged and tried for the crime of abortion (a jury found them not\n\
    guilty), there is no political will to repeal criminal provisions that\n\
    hark back to 1861. The reason? In Queensland, the Liberals, in coalition\n\
    with the Nationals, have a highly religious conservative bent and have\n\
    joined forces with those of similar persuasion in Queensland Labor to\n\
    stymie change.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Baillieu is not progressive on every issue (although it\xE2\x80\x99s easy for him\n\
    to appear this way when his federal counterparts continue to move &ndash; to\n\
    quote former prime minister Malcolm Fraser &ndash; \xE2\x80\x9Cfurther and further to the\n\
    right\xE2\x80\x9D). He is against gay marriage, a stance that undercuts his usual\n\
    commitment to equity and diversity. But John Brumby opposes gay\n\
    marriage, too. Unlike the Premier, Baillieu supports physician-assisted\n\
    dying, an issue likely to occupy the attention of the new Victorian\n\
    Parliament if the Greens have their way.</p>\n\n\
    <p>So where does that leave Victorians who want to act in a principled\n\
    fashion, but also tactically and with an eye to the future, when casting\n\
    their vote?</p>\n\n\
    <p>I think anyone who wants Victoria to remain the most sane and\n\
    forward-looking state in the nation, anyone who wants the Liberal Party\n\
    to remain a party of liberalism &ndash; not religious conservatism &ndash; has to\n\
    look hard at Baillieu\xE2\x80\x99s Liberals this time around because the stark\n\
    truth is that unless a small-l Liberal opposition can win its way\n\
    through to government &ndash; and soon &ndash; there won\xE2\x80\x99t be any small-l Liberals\n\
    left.</p>\n"

    South Wales - states lumbered with the same antiquated and unclear\r\n\
    criminal provisions on abortion that reigned in Victoria - to recognise\r\n\
    the key role of a small-l Liberal opposition.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Even in Queensland, where last month a young woman and her boyfriend\r\n\
    were charged and tried for the crime of abortion (a jury found them not\r\n\
    guilty), there is no political will to repeal criminal provisions that\r\n\
    hark back to 1861. The reason? In Queensland, the Liberals, in coalition\r\n\
    with the Nationals, have a highly religious conservative bent and have\r\n\
    joined forces with those of similar persuasion in Queensland Labor to\r\n\
    stymie change.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Baillieu is not progressive on every issue (although it\xE2\x80\x99s easy for him\r\n\
    to appear this way when his federal counterparts continue to move - to\r\n\
    quote former prime minister Malcolm Fraser - \xE2\x80\x9Cfurther and further to the\r\n\
    right\xE2\x80\x9D). He is against gay marriage, a stance that undercuts his usual\r\n\
    commitment to equity and diversity. But John Brumby opposes gay\r\n\
    marriage, too. Unlike the Premier, Baillieu supports physician-assisted\r\n\
    dying, an issue likely to occupy the attention of the new Victorian\r\n\
    Parliament if the Greens have their way.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    So where does that leave Victorians who want to act in a principled\r\n\
    fashion, but also tactically and with an eye to the future, when casting\r\n\
    their vote?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I think anyone who wants Victoria to remain the most sane and\r\n\
    forward-looking state in the nation, anyone who wants the Liberal Party\r\n\
    to remain a party of liberalism - not religious conservatism - has to\r\n\
    look hard at Baillieu\xE2\x80\x99s Liberals this time around because the stark\r\n\
    truth is that unless a small-l Liberal opposition can win its way\r\n\
    through to government - and soon - there won\xE2\x80\x99t be any small-l Liberals\r\n\
    left."

  title: What the Lindy Chamberlain, Patsy Ramsey, Kate McCann & now Keli Lane Case Says About Us
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 18:11:56
  content_markup: "<p>Last week journalist Michael Duffy wrote that there was \xE2\x80\x9Ca great\n\
    disconnect\xE2\x80\x9D between \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat we know [Keli Lane] did &ndash; even putting aside\n\
    the murder allegation &ndash; and the fact that by literally all public\n\
    accounts she was a normal, happy and sociable northern beaches girl with\n\
    a supportive and loving family, a passion for sport, and a healthy\n\
    social life\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I disagree that the \xE2\x80\x9Cgreat disconnect\xE2\x80\x9D is between Lane\xE2\x80\x99s public persona\n\
    and her sexual activity, repetitive pregnancies and the use of abortion\n\
    and adoption as solutions.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The disconnect is between the contradictory and punitive judgments\n\
    Australians pass on women\xE2\x80\x99s sexual and reproductive lives, and our\n\
    denial of the corrosive impact these verdicts &ndash; and the restrictive laws\n\
    that result &ndash; have on women\xE2\x80\x99s self-esteem and their capacity to control\n\
    their lives.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The moral panic over Lane is familiar. We saw it in the Azaria\n\
    Chamberlain, JonBenet Ramsey and Madeleine McCann cases. In each, the\n\
    children\xE2\x80\x99s mothers &ndash; Lindy, Patsy and Kate &ndash; were pilloried for crying\n\
    too little or too much, for being manipulative or inscrutable. In each,\n\
    media coverage painted the woman as deviant &ndash; a bad mother &ndash; and so\n\
    culpable for her own tragedy. Such a strategy, says Booker prize-winning\n\
    novelist Anne Enright, is a \xE2\x80\x9Cpotent form of magic\xE2\x80\x9D that calms anxieties\n\

  content: "Last week journalist Michael Duffy wrote that there was \xE2\x80\x9Ca great\r\n\
    disconnect\xE2\x80\x9D between \xE2\x80\x9Cwhat we know [Keli Lane] did - even putting aside\r\n\
    the murder allegation - and the fact that by literally all public\r\n\
    accounts she was a normal, happy and sociable northern beaches girl with\r\n\
    a supportive and loving family, a passion for sport, and a healthy\r\n\
    social life\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    I disagree that the \xE2\x80\x9Cgreat disconnect\xE2\x80\x9D is between Lane\xE2\x80\x99s public persona\r\n\
    and her sexual activity, repetitive pregnancies and the use of abortion\r\n\
    and adoption as solutions.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The disconnect is between the contradictory and punitive judgments\r\n\
    Australians pass on women\xE2\x80\x99s sexual and reproductive lives, and our\r\n\
    denial of the corrosive impact these verdicts - and the restrictive laws\r\n\
    that result - have on women\xE2\x80\x99s self-esteem and their capacity to control\r\n\
    their lives.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The moral panic over Lane is familiar. We saw it in the Azaria\r\n\
    Chamberlain, JonBenet Ramsey and Madeleine McCann cases. In each, the\r\n\
    children\xE2\x80\x99s mothers - Lindy, Patsy and Kate - were pilloried for crying\r\n\
    too little or too much, for being manipulative or inscrutable. In each,\r\n\
    media coverage painted the woman as deviant - a bad mother - and so\r\n\
    culpable for her own tragedy. Such a strategy, says Booker prize-winning\r\n\
    novelist Anne Enright, is a \xE2\x80\x9Cpotent form of magic\xE2\x80\x9D that calms anxieties\r\n\
    that our own children are at risk.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The coverage of Keli Lane also stereotypes her as a bad and unnatural\r\n\
    woman - sexually rapacious, frivolously social, hyper-ambitious. This\r\n\
    allows us to cast her out, beyond our collective compassion and any need\r\n\
    to hear in her story something painfully revelatory about us, in\r\n\
    particular about the conflicting messages Australian society is sending\r\n\

  title: Did Jesus Have a Sister?
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 12:48:56
  content_markup: "<p>Years ago, I was watching a documentary series on ABC TV called Son of\n\
    God. The program set out to find the historical person that Christians\n\
    now revere as Jesus Christ.</p>\n\n\
    <p>At one point in a spell-binding narrative, we were told the names of all\n\
    of Jesus\xE2\x80\x99s brothers, and some details of what had become of them. But\n\
    whether Jesus had sisters and how many, the narration continued\n\
    breezily, was something we could not know because all the references to\n\
    sisters in the gospels were unclear. The existence of such women and\n\
    their names had not been documented.</p>\n\n\
    <p>What kind of world painstakingly documents facts about a well-known\n\
    figure\xE2\x80\x99s male relatives, but allows the female ones to be lost to\n\
    history? Recalling my lower jaw from the floor, I took myself off to the\n\
    library to find out.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The explanation I came up with was as illuminating as it was depressing.\n\
    Two thousand years ago in the Middle East, a scribe would no more record\n\
    the names of a famous man\xE2\x80\x99s sister than a reporter today doing a profile\n\
    on a farmer would write down the names of his sheep. Women simply\n\
    weren\xE2\x80\x99t considered people back then. They were, like a man\xE2\x80\x99s flocks,\n\
    just chattels.</p>\n\n\
    <p>What would it have been like to be a girl at this time? Particularly a\n\
    bright, inquisitive girl who admired her older brother and, just like\n\
    him, thirsted to play a role in resolving the fierce conflicts &ndash; over\n\
    beliefs, identity and territory &ndash; that were raging at the time?</p>\n\n\
    <p>How might a man like Jesus &ndash; whose actual name was most likely Joshua &ndash;\n\
    have replied to the predicament of such an intelligent and beloved\n\
    sister? My intuition, and reading of the few sayings that scholars tend\n\
    to agree Joshua actually uttered, is that he would have responded with\n\
    compassion.</p>\n\n\
    <p>To make this case, you have to know something about the world in which\n\
    our hero &ndash; and perhaps our heroine &ndash; came of age. There, an individual\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    standing and status among his fellows was entirely dependent on his\n\
    relationship with God. Human suffering was seen as proof of sin and the\n\
    Lord\xE2\x80\x99s punitive hand. To win God\xE2\x80\x99s forgiveness, one must atone through\n\
    sacrifice at the Temple in Jerusalem.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The cost of an animal sacrifice, on top of the price to simply enter the\n\
    Temple, was beyond the means of many Israelites.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The spoils of this spiritual monopoly flowed into the pockets of the\n\
    hereditary Jewish elite who the Romans allowed to run the Temple any way\n\
    they saw fit as long as they were acquiescent on other matters of state.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Unable to afford redemption, the poor remained \xE2\x80\x9Cunclean\xE2\x80\x9D &ndash; beyond the\n\
    sight of God and man. The infirm suffered terribly, too, particularly\n\
    when the sacrifices offered on their behalf by the Temple priests failed\n\
    to bring about the desired cure for their leprosy or schizophrenia,\n\
    proving them doubly cursed by God.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Less well understood is that women, by virtue of their gender, were also\n\
    quasi outcasts in ancient Israelite society. Their access to God &ndash; the\n\
    key to their status in the world &ndash; was entirely dependent on their\n\
    relationship with men. To be seen in God\xE2\x80\x99s eyes, a woman had to be\n\
    someone\xE2\x80\x99s daughter, sister, mother or wife. This is why in the Bible,\n\
    widows and divorcees crop up as victims of harsh social circumstances\n\
    again and again, and mothers yearn so desperately for the social\n\
    insurance of a son, who can still win them blessings when the other men\n\
    they depend on are dead and gone.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Joshua of Nazareth understood the plight of outcasts. \xE2\x80\x9CThe first will be\n\
    last and the last first,\xE2\x80\x9D he said. \xE2\x80\x9CBlessed are the destitute, the\n\
    reviled, those who weep, who suffer and are hungry,\xE2\x80\x9D he insisted. While\n\
    some say that such calls for recognition and respect for society\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    reviled did not encompass women, this seems doubtful when he often\n\
    explicitly included them.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In the sayings and parables most scholars agree can be attributed to\n\
    Joshua, we find justice-seeking widows, coin-sweeping housewives and\n\
    prudent bakers who know just how to leaven bread so that one loaf\n\
    becomes many.</p>\n\n\
    <p>In the gospel of Thomas, Joshua responds to Peter\xE2\x80\x99s scathing dismissal\n\
    of disciple Mary Magdalene as \xE2\x80\x9Cnot worthy of life\xE2\x80\x9D by insisting that he\n\
    will \xE2\x80\x9Cguide her \xE2\x80\xA6 for every female who makes herself male will enter\n\
    heaven\xE2\x80\x99s kingdom\xE2\x80\x9D. Added to this is evidence that women comprised many,\n\
    if not most, of Joshua\xE2\x80\x99s followers. Perhaps among these dignity-seeking\n\
    Jewish women was one or more of Joshua\xE2\x80\x99s sisters?</p>\n\n\
    <p>The truth is that we\xE2\x80\x99ll never know. When I realised so many years ago\n\
    that Joshua\xE2\x80\x99s sisters had been cruelly written out of history, and that\n\
    no matter how much I cared, I could not reinstate them, I felt useless.\n\
    None of the tools I had spent so many years acquiring as an academic\n\
    scholar and general audience non-fiction writer were in any way equal to\n\
    the task. I was surplus to what these women required.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I tried to forget the sisters. To abandon them to the dust of the\n\
    unmarked past where I\xE2\x80\x99d found them, but failed. To do so made me feel\n\
    complicit in perpetuating what they\xE2\x80\x99d already suffered &ndash; the terrible\n\
    pain of being forgotten.</p>\n\n\
    <p>There was only one thing left to do. Slowly, I learned the craft of\n\
    fiction writing so I could tell these stories the only way they could be\n\
    told. By letting my imagination take wing.</p>\n"

  content_markup: "<p>Mention Australia\xE2\x80\x99s caesarean section rate and collective tongues start\n\
    wagging. Our rate is too high, the experts say, partly because some\n\
    mothers are too posh to push.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It is true that Australia\xE2\x80\x99s caesarean rate is high and, until recently,\n\
    climbing. In 1997, 20 per cent of women gave birth by caesarean. By\n\
    2007, the rate had climbed to 31 per cent, where it remains. This is at\n\
    least double the 10 to 15 per cent proportion recommended by the World\n\
    Health Organisation.</p>\n\n\
    <p>But that ideal is 25 years out of date. Britain\xE2\x80\x99s Parliamentary Office\n\
    of Science and Technology says that if it repeated the exercise used to\n\
    arrive at the initial figures, it would come up with a \xE2\x80\x9Crather higher\n\
    range\xE2\x80\x9D. This is because the recommendation was derived from caesarean\n\
    figures in countries that had the lowest mortality rates at the time\n\
    and, today, few countries have caesarean rates below 15 per cent.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Caesarean rates follow the money. In Brazil, caesarean rates in the\n\
    private sector are 80 per cent. In Australia, women giving birth in\n\
    private hospitals have a caesarean rate of 41 per cent, compared to 28\n\
    per cent for those in the public system.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Staff attitudes and institutional culture with regard to women\xE2\x80\x99s choice\n\
    also play a part. In one Australian study, 62 per cent of women having a\n\
    caesarean in a private hospital said their healthcare provider had\n\
    recommended it. This contrasted with the 40 per cent in the public\n\
    sector.</p>\n\n\
    <p>A comparison of two British hospitals by the Parliamentary Office of\n\
    Science and Technology found that caesarean rates were lower in the\n\
    institution where women lacked the \xE2\x80\x9Cfreedom\xE2\x80\x9D to \xE2\x80\x9Cexpress a preference\n\
    for caesarean section\xE2\x80\x9D and higher where women were \xE2\x80\x9Cgiven information\n\
    about the known relative risks of [caesarean] and vaginal birth\xE2\x80\x9Dand\n\
    allowed to make \xE2\x80\xA6 the final choice\".</p>\n\n\
    <p>Such findings should sound alarm bells to anyone interested in the right\n\

    <p>Informed women have the right to choose their delivery method</p>

  content: "Mention Australia\xE2\x80\x99s caesarean section rate and collective tongues start\r\n\
    wagging. Our rate is too high, the experts say, partly because some\r\n\
    mothers are too posh to push.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It is true that Australia\xE2\x80\x99s caesarean rate is high and, until recently,\r\n\
    climbing. In 1997, 20 per cent of women gave birth by caesarean. By\r\n\
    2007, the rate had climbed to 31 per cent, where it remains. This is at\r\n\
    least double the 10 to 15 per cent proportion recommended by the World\r\n\
    Health Organisation.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But that ideal is 25 years out of date. Britain\xE2\x80\x99s Parliamentary Office\r\n\
    of Science and Technology says that if it repeated the exercise used to\r\n\
    arrive at the initial figures, it would come up with a \xE2\x80\x9Crather higher\r\n\
    range\xE2\x80\x9D. This is because the recommendation was derived from caesarean\r\n\
    figures in countries that had the lowest mortality rates at the time\r\n\
    and, today, few countries have caesarean rates below 15 per cent.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Caesarean rates follow the money. In Brazil, caesarean rates in the\r\n\
    private sector are 80 per cent. In Australia, women giving birth in\r\n\
    private hospitals have a caesarean rate of 41 per cent, compared to 28\r\n\
    per cent for those in the public system.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Staff attitudes and institutional culture with regard to women\xE2\x80\x99s choice\r\n\
    also play a part. In one Australian study, 62 per cent of women having a\r\n\
    caesarean in a private hospital said their healthcare provider had\r\n\
    recommended it. This contrasted with the 40 per cent in the public\r\n\
    sector.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    A comparison of two British hospitals by the Parliamentary Office of\r\n\
    Science and Technology found that caesarean rates were lower in the\r\n\
    institution where women lacked the \xE2\x80\x9Cfreedom\xE2\x80\x9D to \xE2\x80\x9Cexpress a preference\r\n\
    for caesarean section\xE2\x80\x9D and higher where women were \xE2\x80\x9Cgiven information\r\n\
    about the known relative risks of [caesarean] and vaginal birth\xE2\x80\x9Dand\r\n\
    allowed to make \xE2\x80\xA6 the final choice\".\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Such findings should sound alarm bells to anyone interested in the right\r\n\
    of women to make free and self-directed choices about their medical\r\n\
    care.\r\n\

  title: Donor Conceived People
  updated_on: 2011-03-24 18:15:39
  content_markup: "<p>The danger with retrospective legislation, which some seek to identify\n\
    sperm donors, lies in its potential for injustice.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Hard cases make bad law. This is as true of the common law and acts\n\
    passed by Parliament as it is of the moral law. That is why whatever\n\
    sympathies we have for donor-conceived adult Kimberley Springfield\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    desire to contact her sperm donor, overhauling the legal framework\n\
    governing assisted reproductive technology in the state and across the\n\
    nation may not be justified.</p>\n\n\
    <p>What is 26-year-old Springfield, whose case is before the Victorian\n\
    Civil and Administrative Tribunal, seeking? She wants the Registry of\n\
    Births, Deaths and Marriages &ndash; which manages the mandatory and voluntary\n\
    registers containing information about Victorian donors, donor-conceived\n\
    offspring and their relatives &ndash; to identify her donor by seeking\n\
    information from the clinic where he gave sperm under conditions of\n\
    anonymity.</p>\n\n\
    <p>She then wants it to use that information to identify his whereabouts\n\
    and to write to him advocating the purpose and benefit of the voluntary\n\
    register.</p>\n\n\
    <p>As Rachel Ellyard, representing the registrar, has made clear, this\n\
    request goes well beyond what is authorised by Victorian law. \xE2\x80\x9CThis\n\
    isn\xE2\x80\x99t about the rights and wrongs of why she would want to do that, but\n\
    it\xE2\x80\x99s a request that goes far beyond the ART [Assisted Reproductive\n\
    Treatment] Act.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>The problem for Springfield is that she was conceived before 1988. She\n\
    has put information on the voluntary register and hoped her donor would\n\
    do the same. But he hasn\xE2\x80\x99t and she has no way of knowing why. Is it\n\
    because he doesn\xE2\x80\x99t want to, or doesn\xE2\x80\x99t know the register exists?</p>\n\n\
    <p>This situation differs from that faced by children conceived after 1988\n\
    but before 1997, whose donors are informed when they use the voluntary\n\
    register to request information about them (a request the donor can\n\
    refuse).</p>\n\n\
    <p>Children conceived after 1997 have a right to identifying information\n\
    about their donor once they turn 18.</p>\n\n\
    <p>It would be nice to equalise the entitlements of the pre~~1988 and\n\
    pre~~1997 groups. But to do this, we would have to violate the legal\n\
    assurances that they would remain anonymous that were given to men who\n\
    donated before 1988.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This promise should never have been given. Thank goodness we have\n\
    changed the law to ensure only donors willing to be identified are\n\
    recruited.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The question is whether the needs of donor-conceived children such as\n\
    Springfield are so compelling they justify enacting retrospective\n\
    legislation.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Retrospective legislation is a big no-no. The choices citizens make are\n\
    based on rules in place at the time. To alter them and force people to\n\
    live with the consequences of a decision they can\xE2\x80\x99t change and to which\n\
    they did not consent is unjust. Worse, it undermines the trust between\n\
    citizens and governments essential for a functioning democracy.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The unravelling of such trust can cause panic. Sperm donors, for\n\
    instance, might start worrying they could be landed with financial\n\
    responsibility for a donor-conceived child. After all, they might think,\n\
    if they welshed on one promise, why not another?</p>\n\n\
    <p>The potential for injustice, distrust and panic is why utterly\n\
    compelling reasons for retrospective legislation are required. I remain\n\
    unconvinced such reasons exist to alter the recently updated Assisted\n\
    Reproductive Treatment Act 2008 again.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Springfield says that without knowledge of her biological father and his\n\
    genetic history she has no way of finding her \xE2\x80\x9Cplace of belonging in the\n\
    world\xE2\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Sorry? Over most of our history, humans have embarked on the quest to\n\
    discover who they are, where they fit and why they matter without sure\n\
    knowledge of the genetic or social history of their male progenitor.\n\
    This is for the simple reason that the identity of the biological father\n\
    could not be definitively known. The suggestion that it is impossible\n\
    for an individual to flourish or live a meaningful life without this\n\
    information seems silly.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Evidence also suggests it is a mistake to give too much weight to the\n\
    contribution one parent\xE2\x80\x99s genetics make to the health, identity and life\n\

  content: "The danger with retrospective legislation, which some seek to identify\r\n\
    sperm donors, lies in its potential for injustice.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Hard cases make bad law. This is as true of the common law and acts\r\n\
    passed by Parliament as it is of the moral law. That is why whatever\r\n\
    sympathies we have for donor-conceived adult Kimberley Springfield\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    desire to contact her sperm donor, overhauling the legal framework\r\n\
    governing assisted reproductive technology in the state and across the\r\n\
    nation may not be justified.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    What is 26-year-old Springfield, whose case is before the Victorian\r\n\
    Civil and Administrative Tribunal, seeking? She wants the Registry of\r\n\
    Births, Deaths and Marriages - which manages the mandatory and voluntary\r\n\
    registers containing information about Victorian donors, donor-conceived\r\n\
    offspring and their relatives - to identify her donor by seeking\r\n\
    information from the clinic where he gave sperm under conditions of\r\n\
    anonymity.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    She then wants it to use that information to identify his whereabouts\r\n\
    and to write to him advocating the purpose and benefit of the voluntary\r\n\
    register.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    As Rachel Ellyard, representing the registrar, has made clear, this\r\n\
    request goes well beyond what is authorised by Victorian law. \xE2\x80\x9CThis\r\n\
    isn\xE2\x80\x99t about the rights and wrongs of why she would want to do that, but\r\n\
    it\xE2\x80\x99s a request that goes far beyond the ART [Assisted Reproductive\r\n\
    Treatment] Act.\xE2\x80\x9D\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The problem for Springfield is that she was conceived before 1988. She\r\n\
    has put information on the voluntary register and hoped her donor would\r\n\
    do the same. But he hasn\xE2\x80\x99t and she has no way of knowing why. Is it\r\n\
    because he doesn\xE2\x80\x99t want to, or doesn\xE2\x80\x99t know the register exists?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This situation differs from that faced by children conceived after 1988\r\n\
    but before 1997, whose donors are informed when they use the voluntary\r\n\
    register to request information about them (a request the donor can\r\n\
    refuse).\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Children conceived after 1997 have a right to identifying information\r\n\
    about their donor once they turn 18.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It would be nice to equalise the entitlements of the pre~~1988 and\r\n\
    pre~~1997 groups. But to do this, we would have to violate the legal\r\n\
    assurances that they would remain anonymous that were given to men who\r\n\
    donated before 1988.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This promise should never have been given. Thank goodness we have\r\n\
    changed the law to ensure only donors willing to be identified are\r\n\
    recruited.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The question is whether the needs of donor-conceived children such as\r\n\
    Springfield are so compelling they justify enacting retrospective\r\n\
    legislation.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Retrospective legislation is a big no-no. The choices citizens make are\r\n\
    based on rules in place at the time. To alter them and force people to\r\n\
    live with the consequences of a decision they can\xE2\x80\x99t change and to which\r\n\
    they did not consent is unjust. Worse, it undermines the trust between\r\n\
    citizens and governments essential for a functioning democracy.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The unravelling of such trust can cause panic. Sperm donors, for\r\n\
    instance, might start worrying they could be landed with financial\r\n\
    responsibility for a donor-conceived child. After all, they might think,\r\n\
    if they welshed on one promise, why not another?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The potential for injustice, distrust and panic is why utterly\r\n\
    compelling reasons for retrospective legislation are required. I remain\r\n\
    unconvinced such reasons exist to alter the recently updated Assisted\r\n\
    Reproductive Treatment Act 2008 again.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Springfield says that without knowledge of her biological father and his\r\n\
    genetic history she has no way of finding her \xE2\x80\x9Cplace of belonging in the\r\n\
    world\xE2\x80\x9D.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Sorry? Over most of our history, humans have embarked on the quest to\r\n\
    discover who they are, where they fit and why they matter without sure\r\n\
    knowledge of the genetic or social history of their male progenitor.\r\n\
    This is for the simple reason that the identity of the biological father\r\n\
    could not be definitively known. The suggestion that it is impossible\r\n\
    for an individual to flourish or live a meaningful life without this\r\n\
    information seems silly.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Evidence also suggests it is a mistake to give too much weight to the\r\n\
    contribution one parent\xE2\x80\x99s genetics make to the health, identity and life\r\n\
    chances of his biological child.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It turns out that nature and nurture don\xE2\x80\x99t just determine our\r\n\
    opportunities but also expression of our genes, which the science of\r\n\
    epigenetics has shown can be turned on and off by our social\r\n\
    environment. The advent of new genetic tests that can scan our own DNA\r\n\
    for hundreds of conditions is fast making knowledge of both parents\xE2\x80\x99\r\n\
    health history irrelevant to our own capacity to understand and care for\r\n\
    our health.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    How many are like Springfield, born before 1988 and convinced they\r\n\
    cannot flourish until they know their biological father? Research does\r\n\
    not tell us. Ideally, however many there are, Victoria would have\r\n\
    legislation that supports the particular requirements of all\r\n\
    donor-conceived people to rest easily with their conception story.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The choices we face are not ideal. I\xE2\x80\x99d support a compromise that saw\r\n\
    every Victorian household sent a letter about the voluntary donor\r\n\
    register, so we had more confidence that those not on the register have\r\n\
    refrained by choice.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But further trashing the trust between citizens and governments by\r\n\
    enacting retrospective legislation (we did this years ago with adoption)\r\n\
    seems neither wise nor fair."

    confer power. Never mind that younger women may be unaware of this power\n\
    or unwilling to use it (often and ironically because they have listened\n\
    when their female elders advised against it). The bald facts are that\n\
    younger women have power that the uncompromising gavel of time has\n\
    pronounced inaccessible to older women. In a world that limits women\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    access to other routes of influence over their own destiny, this loss\n\
    hurts.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Older women can be less willing mentors than older men. Take a look\n\
    around and the reasons for this become clear. To give those scrambling\n\
    up behind you a helping hand, you need to be well ahead of them and have\n\
    a firm grip. But the higher up you go in the media, government,\n\
    entertainment or corporate worlds, the fewer women you\xE2\x80\x99ll find. In 2010,\n\
    for example, 2.5 per cent of ASX 200 chairmen and 3 per cent of chief\n\
    executives were women. Just 30 per cent of parliamentarians are female\n\
    and far fewer of these have safe seats or ministerial posts.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Some women who have managed to scrape their way to the top don\xE2\x80\x99t feel\n\
    secure enough for generosity. They\xE2\x80\x99ve done the sums and, in contrast to\n\
    their male counterparts, they know they\xE2\x80\x99re competing with junior women\n\
    for the scarce, even token, spots allocated for females.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The generation gap is not the only one that divides women. What about\n\
    women-led social movements with anti-women agendas? Whether it\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    fundamentalist religious movements striving to return pregnant and\n\
    economically dependent women to the home, or political parties dedicated\n\
    to cutting funding to child care and food aid for the children of the\n\
    mostly female poor, women can be well-represented among those driving\n\
    and supporting laws that deny their own sex autonomy and dignity.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Perhaps they are in denial. To work towards advancing the interests of\n\
    her sex, a woman must admit that sexism exists and is crimping her own\n\
    life chances. Some women are loath to do this, especially when the only\n\
    sensible corrective is to steal time from the pursuit of her personal\n\
    ambitions to assume the gargantuan task of changing the world.</p>\n\n\
    <p>While not admirable, I can understand the woman who wishes so hard that\n\
    she had the freedom to simply get on with living her life in the same\n\
    way she can see her male siblings and friends doing that she convinces\n\
    herself that she does.</p>\n\n\
    <p>As a repentant young woman recently explained of her former pro-life\n\
    stance, \xE2\x80\x9CBecause I was saving myself for marriage &hellip; I knew that I\n\
    would &hellip; never be a murderer like those sluts.\xE2\x80\x9D Insisting one is\n\
    different, special and more virtuous than other women &ndash; and so not in\n\
    need of the social salves they seek &ndash; is the act of a fragile ego. But\n\
    it also speaks poignant volumes about the yearning all humans have to\n\
    duck obstacles of bias and discrimination and gain a respected place in\n\
    society on their own steam.</p>\n"

    The generation gap is not the only one that divides women. What about\r\n\
    women-led social movements with anti-women agendas? Whether it\xE2\x80\x99s\r\n\
    fundamentalist religious movements striving to return pregnant and\r\n\
    economically dependent women to the home, or political parties dedicated\r\n\
    to cutting funding to child care and food aid for the children of the\r\n\
    mostly female poor, women can be well-represented among those driving\r\n\
    and supporting laws that deny their own sex autonomy and dignity.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Perhaps they are in denial. To work towards advancing the interests of\r\n\
    her sex, a woman must admit that sexism exists and is crimping her own\r\n\
    life chances. Some women are loath to do this, especially when the only\r\n\
    sensible corrective is to steal time from the pursuit of her personal\r\n\
    ambitions to assume the gargantuan task of changing the world.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    While not admirable, I can understand the woman who wishes so hard that\r\n\
    she had the freedom to simply get on with living her life in the same\r\n\
    way she can see her male siblings and friends doing that she convinces\r\n\
    herself that she does.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    As a repentant young woman recently explained of her former pro-life\r\n\
    stance, \xE2\x80\x9CBecause I was saving myself for marriage . . . I knew that I\r\n\
    would . . . never be a murderer like those sluts.\xE2\x80\x9D Insisting one is\r\n\
    different, special and more virtuous than other women - and so not in\r\n\
    need of the social salves they seek - is the act of a fragile ego. But\r\n\
    it also speaks poignant volumes about the yearning all humans have to\r\n\
    duck obstacles of bias and discrimination and gain a respected place in\r\n\
    society on their own steam."

    plight that, according to refugee advocates, includes severe\n\

    their plight and to have their situation resolved one way or another.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Like many Australians, I have been following the national debate about\n\
    asylum-seekers arriving by boat since it became a partisan issue during\n\
    the Howard years. I remember well the dead-fish tones of then\n\
    Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock insinuating that all attempts by\n\
    refugees to achieve a \xE2\x80\x9Cdesired migration outcome\xE2\x80\x9D were &ndash; and should\n\
    rightly be viewed by the community &ndash; as manipulative of our emotions,\n\
    Australian law, or both.</p>\n\n\
    <p>We saw this back in 2000 when senior government ministers including\n\
    Ruddock and Prime Minister John Howard said that asylum seekers had\n\
    thrown their children overboard, claims that would later be shown to be\n\
    false &ndash; and to have been known to be false by those making them.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The intent of the charges seemed be to undermine the character of boat\n\
    people. What sort of human beings would throw their own children\n\
    overboard at all, little less for the purpose of manipulating the good\n\

    outcome? Ruddock called it \xE2\x80\x9Cone of the most disturbing incidents he\xE2\x80\x99d\n\

    late 19th century when the growth of China\xE2\x80\x99s population led some\n\

    <p><em>What, No Baby?</em> takes us on journey into the lives of contemporary women who plan to have it all &ndash; marriage, motherhood and work &ndash; yet have been derailed by reluctant men, insatiably demanding jobs and ever-climbing expectations of what it takes to be a &ldquo;good&rdquo; mother.</p>
    
    <p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics predicts that 25% of Australian women currently in their reproductive years will never have children. Yet respected researcher and ethicists Leslie Cannold argues that women want to mother as much as they ever did. What has changed is their willingness to sacrifice everything they&rsquo;ve built &ndash; everything they are &ndash; to do so. Drawing on demographic data. social research and insights gained from interviews with women in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, Cannold shows that the easier society makes it for women to combine parenthood and paid work, the closer women get to having the number of children they want.</p>
    
    <p>At the end of the 21st century, it is women&rsquo;s freedom to mother that is most at risk. Guaranteed to reshape the current debate around sustained low fertility, <em>What, no baby?</em> is a must-red for everyone concerned about Australia&rsquo;s fertility rate and for women who want to better understand &ndash; and to solve &ndash; the social problems keeping them from fulfilling lives in which children play a part.</p>

    <p><strong>What Readers Are Saying About</strong> <strong><em>What, No Baby?</em></strong></p>
    
    <blockquote><p><em>I have just read (rather, devoured) your book &ldquo;What, No Baby?&rdquo;. I am currently going through a break up with a truly wonderful man, because he is desperate to have children now, while I am 98% decided that I never want them. (In any case, I certainly don&rsquo;t want them &ldquo;in time&rdquo; for him.) My indecision has come from a suspicion that there was information I wasn&rsquo;t considering; as you said, the happy parents are deafeningly silent on the positives of having children.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>Those parents who do try to convince me I should have children, or that I&rsquo;ll regret it one day, say things like &ldquo;who will look after you when you&rsquo;re old&rdquo; and &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all worth it when they say &lsquo;I love you&rsquo;&rdquo;. Reason one is clearly ridiculous and invalid, while reason two reminds me of friends of mine who have tried to justify remaining in physically abusive relationships. Yet there didn&rsquo;t seem to be any other reasons!</em></p>
    
    <p><em>In contrast, your book opened my eyes to considerations that I have not encountered in FOUR YEARS of research through various avenues. I came to question how much of my &ldquo;choice&rdquo; is really valid, since in this case I want to be true to my heart, not to my head. I certainly bristle at the realisation that it is to a great extent society that is driving this very personal choice of mine.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>Through your book, I&rsquo;ve been able to more objectively take apart and reasses the various factors I&rsquo;ve considered. Most importantly, I&rsquo;ve been able to see through the peripherals to the core of it &ndash; the fact remains that I feel no strong desire for motherhood, even with all of those outside influences aside.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>In truth I have always felt quite a strong &ndash; even physical &ndash; aversion to the thought of pregnancy, breast feeding, and especially to the corny gaga roses-and-cottonwool visions of motherhood as a necessary ingredient of true womanhood.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>You have helped me to reconsider the validity and true motivations behind my &ldquo;choice&rdquo; and in so doing, you have guided me to becoming more sure of my decision, more aware of its repercussions, and better armed in the struggle to be respected by those who prefer to take other paths in life and feel that I should too. You&rsquo;ve given me clarity in choosing how to proceed (or not to) in my current relationship and taken away some of the guilt I have felt in not being the &ldquo;normal, proper and whole&rdquo; woman that my partner wants me to be.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>Finally, after wading through a great deal of militant, stupid and nasty childfree rhetoric which is met by equally militant, stupid and nasty pro-parenting rhetoric, you have been a refreshingly open minded and non-blaming voice amongst the muck of useless bitterness on both sides.</em></p>

    <p><em>The Abortion Myth</em> forges a new women-centred abortion ethic capable of preserving a woman&rsquo;s right to control her body and her freedom to choose or reject motherhood. At the centre of the book are interviews with 45 &lsquo;pro-choice&rsquo; and &lsquo;pro-life&rsquo; women. The women who share their stories have no doubt that it is their right to choose abortion. Yet many have begun to find the rumble of so many unanswered questions about the morality of this choice hard to ignore. Are some pregnancies irresponsible? What reasons for having an abortion are bad ones? Does the fetus matter, how much and why? And even if a woman has a right to choose abortion, is it always right for her to make that choice?</p>
    
    <p>Written in an engaging and easy-to-read style, <em>The Abortion Myth</em> is a book no one who cares about the fate of women&rsquo;s reproductive freedoms in a rapidly changing world can afford to miss.</p>

    <blockquote><p>&ldquo;The women I interviewed, no matter what side of the abortion fence they were on,&rdquo; writes Leslie Cannold in The Abortion Myth, &ldquo;were clear that the fetus is alive, and abortion kills it. None of them, however, believed these facts proved that abortion was wrong.&rdquo; Cannold criticizes pro-choice feminists for denying the fetus in an effort to bring the woman back into focus as the locus of pregnancy and the agent of decision-making. In her view, women are moral persons for whom the decision to abort derives less from a sense of rights or privacy and more from a broader evaluation of what the &ldquo;right&rdquo; thing to do is. This evaluation speaks to their attitudes towards pregnancy and motherhood, and the real difference between pro- and anti-choice women is their level of trust that other women will &ldquo;act morally.&rdquo;"</p>
    
    <p>Cannold builds on the work of such scholars as Kristin Luker, Faye Ginsburg, and Carol Gilligan, and takes on the controversial work of her own mentor, Peter Singer, on how ectogenesis might affect the abortion decision. Methodologically, The Abortion Myth suffers from some of the same flaws as Gilligan&rsquo;s In a Different Voice &ndash; a small, self-selected sample &ndash; and Cannold&rsquo;s normative stance is clear throughout. She is, after all, a graduate student and fellow in bioethics. The author is American but does all her work in Australia, and it is certainly fruitful to hear other voices and perspectives coming from a non-U.S. context. The Abortion Myth has been revised and updated for an American audience. Where the original Australian edition was produced as a trade book, this new version, published by a university press consortium, reflects Cannold&rsquo;s desire to engage the enormous academic and political debate that surrounds abortion, especially in the United States. The result is an interesting and thought-provoking read for the sophisticated lay reader.</p></blockquote>

There&rsquo;s nothing cavalier or casual about most women&rsquo;s decision to have an abortion, nor are most women thinking about their &ldquo;rights&rdquo; when they make this decision.

    *The Abortion Myth* forges a new women-centred abortion ethic capable of preserving a woman's right to control her body and her freedom to choose or reject motherhood. At the centre of the book are interviews with 45 'pro-choice' and 'pro-life' women. The women who share their stories have no doubt that it is their right to choose abortion. Yet many have begun to find the rumble of so many unanswered questions about the morality of this choice hard to ignore. Are some pregnancies irresponsible? What reasons for having an abortion are bad ones? Does the fetus matter, how much and why? And even if a woman has a right to choose abortion, is it always right for her to make that choice?
    
    Written in an engaging and easy-to-read style, *The Abortion Myth* is a book no one who cares about the fate of women's reproductive freedoms in a rapidly changing world can afford to miss.
    
    *The Abortion Myth* received an "outstanding" mark in the ALA 2002 University Press Books Selected for Public and Secondary School Libraries, 12th Edition.
    
    **What people are saying about** ***The Abortion Myth***
    
    > "The women I interviewed, no matter what side of the abortion fence they were on," writes Leslie Cannold in The Abortion Myth, "were clear that the fetus is alive, and abortion kills it. None of them, however, believed these facts proved that abortion was wrong." Cannold criticizes pro-choice feminists for denying the fetus in an effort to bring the woman back into focus as the locus of pregnancy and the agent of decision-making. In her view, women are moral persons for whom the decision to abort derives less from a sense of rights or privacy and more from a broader evaluation of what the "right" thing to do is. This evaluation speaks to their attitudes towards pregnancy and motherhood, and the real difference between pro- and anti-choice women is their level of trust that other women will "act morally.""

      What if the man you loved betrayed your brother? Two thousand years ago, as a charismatic young preacher from Nazareth was gathering followers among the people of Galilee, his sister swept floors and dreamed of learning to read. In Leslie Cannold's story, it is the women of Nazareth who take centre stage.
      
      The rebellious, gifted Rachael, consigned by her sex to a life of drudgery.
      
      Bindy, the crone who teaches her the skills of the healer.
      
      Shona her sister, the victim of a harsh social code, and their mother Miriame, a woman seemingly unable to love.
      
      When Rachael falls in love with her brother's dearest friend, the rebel Judah of Iscariot, it seems that at least one of the women of Nazareth may find happiness. Then a message comes from her brother in Jerusalem and events begin to unfold that will change not just Rachael's life, but the world, forever.
      
      > *"Passionate, eloquent and compelling, a terrific idea beautifully realised - I couldn't put it down."*
      
      *Liz Byrski*
      
      > *"Only a writer as insightful as Cannold could imagine Rachael's story so intelligently. Read it as a historical page-turner, as a moving romantic tragedy or as a parable about equality-but read it."*
      
      *Toni Jordan*
      
      > *"The church has spent millennia writing women out of history. In the wonderful Book of Rachael, Leslie Cannold returns them to their rightful place at the centre of one of our most powerful stories."*
      
      *Sophie Cunningham*
      
      **What Critics are Saying about** ***The Book of Rachael***
      
      > *The Book of Rachael tells the story of Jesus' younger sister, who is 'ambitious, passionate and unconstrained by her upbringing', and who 'falls in love with Judah of Iscariot, Joshua's best friend and the man who will change their lives forever'. Public commentator and nonfiction author Leslie Cannold had chosen an ambitious topic for her first foray into the world of fiction. She extends this story in an expert manner, showing the reader the reality of the women in Jesus' life through engaging and fast-paced prose. 4 stars*

  title: Good Parents Send Their Kids to Private School, Don't They?
  submission_notify_name: 
  submission_intro: 
  content_markup: |
    <p>The Bankwest press release was crafted to provoke controversy. &ldquo;More Australians Choose a Good Time over Kids Education.&rdquo; It had the same flavour as the bank&rsquo;s offering when it released similar market research last year. &ldquo;Aussie families prefer holidays and Botox to private school education.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Yes, the Bankwest &ldquo;Social Indicator Series&rdquo; is back, demonstrating once again that some Australian parents won&rsquo;t forgo dining out, yoga classes, movies or holidays to pay fees for a non-government school.</p>
    
    <p>Not only are parents who don&rsquo;t sacrifice to send their kids to private school vacuous and selfish, they&rsquo;re stupid, too. As the press release makes clear, parent satisfaction with private schools is on the increase, while those who send their kids to public school are increasingly downcast.</p>
    
    <p>Bankwest&rsquo;s spokesman, Adrian Bradley, explains the problem clearly. Parents just &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t prepared to budge on lifestyle [despite] the widely held perception that parents will sacrifice nearly anything in the interests of their kids&rdquo;.</p>
    
    <p>Are those who sacrifice house renovations, family holidays, pools, dinner, yoga classes or movies to pay for private school good parents, while those who refuse to give up such &ldquo;luxuries&rdquo; bad?</p>
    
    <p>Bankwest thinks so, for its own self-interested reasons. Parents who refuse to sweat about their incapacity to pay close to $15,000 per year per darling to send their children to non-government schools are decidedly uninterested in the savings products the bank sells. An absence of parental anxiety about &ldquo;planning ahead&rdquo; to secure their children&rsquo;s educational future is bad for business.</p>
    
    <p>But back in the real world, who the good and bad parents are is less clear. If I hadn&rsquo;t done yoga when I had two children under two, I would have been a snarling, raving, stressed-out mess. I still remember my now 13-year-old looking up at me as we marched off the beach on the last day of a long-ago family holiday. He was two. &ldquo;Can we come here always?&rdquo; he asked, and I knew what he meant.</p>
    
    <p>Can we come to this place where you and Daddy are always around and no one is rushing off to work or taking me to creche or cramming me into a trolley so we can do the supermarket shopping? Can we come to this place where everyone isn&rsquo;t busy and we&rsquo;re together all the time? Call it a luxury, but our yearly family holiday is the glue that holds my clan together. Sacrifice it to cover less than half the fees for one child to attend private school? Not on your nelly.</p>
    
    <p>A house with a pool is a drawcard for the sort of informal neighbourhood gatherings that build community. Experts advise parents to take time each week to have dinner or spend time together without the kids if they want to save their marriage. Renovating one&rsquo;s house could mean the addition of a flat so the kids can spend more time with grandma, or an open-plan kitchen that allows parents to cook while yakking to the kids.</p>
    
    <p>There is nothing wrong with Australians arguing passionately and loudly about what makes a good parent. Parenting matters and, for many of us, raising our corner of the next generation is the most important job we&rsquo;ll ever have. It is both right and human that we would look for rules and examples to follow, and strive to measure up.</p>
    
    <p>The problem is that while old ideals of good motherhood and fatherhood have been discredited, new standards have yet to evolve. Most mothers under 40 would likely reject the 1950s view that a good mother does not work outside the home, but disagree about the right mix of paid and home-based work a good mother should undertake. Modern men, too, are clear they want to be different to their own fathers, more involved and less consumed by the demands of earning, but are also unsure how to get the balance right.</p>
    
    <p>Uncertainty about what a good parent is makes us vulnerable to anxiety and guilt about getting it wrong. The Bankwest survey is an attempt to leverage those emotions to serve the bank&rsquo;s bottom line. It follows a long and unfortunate Australian tradition of using the public/private school issue as a proxy for debate about who is and isn&rsquo;t a good parent.</p>
    
    <p>A diverse community will have diverse values about what makes a good parent. Where liberty is prized, and people of different backgrounds live side-by-side, good parenting standards may not be ideals to which we all aspire, but minimum standards of &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; parenting below which no one ought fall.</p>
    
    <p>The capacity of parents to defer their own needs to meet their child&rsquo;s is one such bottom line, though parents will disagree about which needs are most important.</p>
    
    <p>I sacrificed for my children, but only to give them what I thought really mattered. A calm and healthy mother, married parents and shared memories of happy times together were what I saw as essential to their future happiness and success.</p>
    
    <p>Saving, borrowing or spending up to half our income to pay for private school was never on the agenda.</p>

  title: "Abbott v, Gillard: Believing in What's Awful, or Nothing at All"
  submission_notify_name: 
  submission_intro: 
  content_markup: |
    <p>Here&rsquo;s a question exercising some voters: What is worse? Casting one&rsquo;s vote for a man who strongly believes in what&rsquo;s awful, or for a woman who believes in nothing except getting herself elected?</p>
    
    <p>The conundrum exposes the two central items on our wishlist for political leaders: that they stand for something, and for something we like.</p>
    
    <p>Liberal Opposition Leader Tony Abbott&rsquo;s strength is his believability. Having observed him for years as a high profile Howard government minister, we trust that he is as he appears: a conservative Catholic man guided in his political judgement by Vatican dictates on personal moral issues like abortion, stem-cell research and euthanasia, and by small government neo-liberal orthodoxy on much else.</p>
    
    <p>The consistent visibility of Abbott&rsquo;s beliefs reassures us. It promises certainty with regard to the direction he would take the country. This is not just because such values direct some choices while prohibiting others but because, having held fast to these values for so long, we feel he won&rsquo;t relinquish them easily. When challenged by economic hard times, boisterous community groups or international recalcitrance, we see Tony Abbott as someone who will fight for his beliefs, not cut and run.</p>
    
    <p>But Abbott&rsquo;s strength is also his weakness. This is for the simple reason that his strongly held moral values are an anathema to most of us. For instance, reputable polls show that around 80 per cent of Australians support legal abortion, stem cell research and voluntary euthanasia. So, too, do we know that the economic agenda of the big business leaders who have his ear will leave most of us &ndash; and the public institutions and infrastructure on which we rely &ndash; worse off.</p>
    
    <p>The Prime Minister&rsquo;s problem is different. As personable as Abbott &ndash; when in &ldquo;real Julia&rdquo; mode, anyway &ndash; she remains a lesser-known quantity. Where she has distinguished herself, or been noted by others, it is most often for matters of form, not substance. She seems smart and articulate, yet we have little sense of what direction she&rsquo;ll steer the country because we don&rsquo;t know the things that really matter to her &ndash; what she&rsquo;ll fight for and never compromise on, no matter what.</p>
    
    <p>Gillard rarely discusses the things she believes in. Because of this, we tend to assume. We assume that because she has a working class background and made education the centrepiece of her parliamentary maiden speech that she favours a first class public education system. Having bravely asserted her lack of faith in God, we assume she will defend the barrier between church and state. Because she is Australia&rsquo;s first female PM, we think she&rsquo;ll stand and fight for the policies women need to succeed.</p>
    
    <p>But we are often proved wrong. In her short time in the top job Gillard has refused to alter the way government funds state and private schools and has expanded the school Christian chaplaincy program by a third. She opposes gay marriage and was the strongest opponent in Rudd&rsquo;s kitchen cabinet of the miserly paid parental leave scheme Australian feminists battled for decades to achieve.</p>
    
    <p>To make matters more confusing, when Gillard moves against what we thought she&rsquo;d defend, she tends to laud her stance as proof of her metal. The MySchools website is a textbook case, though what she expects us to draw from it is anyone&rsquo;s guess. Does she view her willingness to screw an expected adversary &ndash; in this case, the education union &ndash; as proof of a practical even-handedness that she sees as the essence of her character? Or is this dispassionate judicial-like persona, concerned with formal process rather than substance, all she is willing to share with us, preferring to keep private the aspects of her character that would reveal her policy preferences and her heart.</p>
    
    <p>Whatever is the case, the real problem is that Labor&rsquo;s tactics have undermined any claim to evidence-based policy at every turn. Whether it&rsquo;s setting aside the Henry Tax Review to placate West Australian miners, or pre-empting its own assessment of the National School Chaplaincy Program to expand it by a third or proposing a citizens assembly to address the science of climate change, Labor has done little more than hand out taxpayer funds to marginal electorates or interest groups that scream the loudest throughout the campaign. And since week three, when Gillard shook of the shackles of Labor&rsquo;s election strategists, she has been in charge and doing it her way.</p>
    
    <p>Having said this, Abbott also seems determined to undermine his own strengths on the character front. Avoiding press forums that might see him go off message, he looks at times to be visibly straining on his lead. While his pounding of the &ldquo;no means no&rdquo; mantra in response to Gillard&rsquo;s request for a debate was widely lauded as a blunder, I suspect it did him good. It affirmed that, despite the muzzling, he remains the same man: oblivious to a feminist anti-rape slogan familiar to many 12-year-olds, and one sincere in his illogical assertion that men with daughters can&rsquo;t be sexist.</p>
    
    <p>There is something dispiriting about watching people we call leaders try to suppress their souls, or pretend they never had one in the first place.

  content: "Here's a question exercising some voters: What is worse? Casting one's vote for a man who strongly believes in what's awful, or for a woman who believes in nothing except getting herself elected?\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The conundrum exposes the two central items on our wishlist for political leaders: that they stand for something, and for something we like.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Liberal Opposition Leader Tony Abbott's strength is his believability. Having observed him for years as a high profile Howard government minister, we trust that he is as he appears: a conservative Catholic man guided in his political judgement by Vatican dictates on personal moral issues like abortion, stem-cell research and euthanasia, and by small government neo-liberal orthodoxy on much else.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The consistent visibility of Abbott's beliefs reassures us. It promises certainty with regard to the direction he would take the country. This is not just because such values direct some choices while prohibiting others but because, having held fast to these values for so long, we feel he won't relinquish them easily. When challenged by economic hard times, boisterous community groups or international recalcitrance, we see Tony Abbott as someone who will fight for his beliefs, not cut and run.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But Abbott's strength is also his weakness. This is for the simple reason that his strongly held moral values are an anathema to most of us. For instance, reputable polls show that around 80 per cent of Australians support legal abortion, stem cell research and voluntary euthanasia. So, too, do we know that the economic agenda of the big business leaders who have his ear will leave most of us - and the public institutions and infrastructure on which we rely - worse off.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The Prime Minister's problem is different. As personable as Abbott - when in \"real Julia\" mode, anyway - she remains a lesser-known quantity. Where she has distinguished herself, or been noted by others, it is most often for matters of form, not substance. She seems smart and articulate, yet we have little sense of what direction she'll steer the country because we don't know the things that really matter to her - what she'll fight for and never compromise on, no matter what.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Gillard rarely discusses the things she believes in. Because of this, we tend to assume. We assume that because she has a working class background and made education the centrepiece of her parliamentary maiden speech that she favours a first class public education system. Having bravely asserted her lack of faith in God, we assume she will defend the barrier between church and state. Because she is Australia's first female PM, we think she'll stand and fight for the policies women need to succeed.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    But we are often proved wrong. In her short time in the top job Gillard has refused to alter the way government funds state and private schools and has expanded the school Christian chaplaincy program by a third. She opposes gay marriage and was the strongest opponent in Rudd's kitchen cabinet of the miserly paid parental leave scheme Australian feminists battled for decades to achieve.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    To make matters more confusing, when Gillard moves against what we thought she'd defend, she tends to laud her stance as proof of her metal. The MySchools website is a textbook case, though what she expects us to draw from it is anyone's guess. Does she view her willingness to screw an expected adversary - in this case, the education union - as proof of a practical even-handedness that she sees as the essence of her character? Or is this dispassionate judicial-like persona, concerned with formal process rather than substance, all she is willing to share with us, preferring to keep private the aspects of her character that would reveal her policy preferences and her heart.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Whatever is the case, the real problem is that Labor's tactics have undermined any claim to evidence-based policy at every turn. Whether it's setting aside the Henry Tax Review to placate West Australian miners, or pre-empting its own assessment of the National School Chaplaincy Program to expand it by a third or proposing a citizens assembly to address the science of climate change, Labor has done little more than hand out taxpayer funds to marginal electorates or interest groups that scream the loudest throughout the campaign. And since week three, when Gillard shook of the shackles of Labor's election strategists, she has been in charge and doing it her way.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Having said this, Abbott also seems determined to undermine his own strengths on the character front. Avoiding press forums that might see him go off message, he looks at times to be visibly straining on his lead. While his pounding of the \"no means no\" mantra in response to Gillard's request for a debate was widely lauded as a blunder, I suspect it did him good. It affirmed that, despite the muzzling, he remains the same man: oblivious to a feminist anti-rape slogan familiar to many 12-year-olds, and one sincere in his illogical assertion that men with daughters can't be sexist.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    There is something dispiriting about watching people we call leaders try to suppress their souls, or pretend they never had one in the first place. This is particularly the case when there seems no reason to have gone to such lengths. As respected social researcher Hugh Mackay has explained, campaigns have little impact on the election results. History shows that polls taken just before campaigns begin usually point to the result.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    This appears to be confirmed by the latest Neilson poll, which has Labor ahead 53 to 47 on a two party preferred basis, figures almost identical to the 52 to 48 split the same poll recorded a week before the election was called.\r\n\

  title: The National School Chaplaincy Program Is an Accident Waiting to Happen

  submission_intro: 
  content_markup: |
    <p>Around one in five young Australians suffers from mental illness. These include anxiety and depressive disorders, as well as complex conditions like anorexia and bulimia. Some 10 per cent of young Australians suffer abuse or neglect while one in five has a parent with poor mental health (21%) or a physical disability (19%).</p>
    
    <p>Young people with mental health issues are at increased risk of dropping out of school, becoming homeless, or ending up in the justice system. They are five times as likely to abuse drugs or alcohol (and from there wind up having unsafe sex, drink-driving or street brawling) and more likely to self-harm and suicide.</p>
    
    <p>Children&rsquo;s mental health services are inadequately funded. Much like adult mental health services, this is not because we lack the money, but have chosen to spend it on something else.</p>
    
    <p>That something else is school chaplaincy. Last week the Gillard government pre-empted its own review and increased the program&rsquo;s funding by more than a third. The total cost to the taxpayer now stands at $437 million.</p>
    
    <p>You might think a government with $437 million would have an eye to the pain and suffering caused when youth mental health problems go untreated. You might think that government would be duty-bound to provide evidence-based solutions by addressing the woeful shortage of qualified counselors in schools (in NSW the one to every 1050 students is more than double the recommended ratio). After all, and quite literally, the lives of children are at stake.</p>
    
    <p>You might think so, but you&rsquo;d be wrong. Instead, the Gillard government has deployed chaplains. School chaplains come from organizations like Scripture Union Australia which sees them as a means by which they can fulfil their organizational aim of, &ldquo;mak[ing] God&rsquo;s Good News known to children [and] young people&rdquo; so &ldquo;they may come to personal faith in our Lord Jesus Christ&hellip;and become both committed church members.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>The Government knows chaplains are evangelical Christians, not mental health experts. This is why departmental guidelines prohibit chaplains from counseling students. They also ban chaplains from providing educational and medical services, as well as from proselytising. All of which begs the question: what exactly are we paying chaplains $20,000 each to do?</p>
    
    <p>I&rsquo;m not the only one wondering. As a report on the program reveals, many chaplains are unclear about their role. A majority admits they do deal with student mental health and depression issues, student alcohol and drug use, physical/emotional abuse and neglect, and suicide and self-harming behaviours. What most don&rsquo;t do is refer to appropriate professionals when out of their depth.</p>
    
    <p>This is not an argument against religion in schools, though one can clearly be made. Rather it is an argument about wrong choices made for bad reasons that are putting our most vulnerable schoolchildren at risk. In a world of scarce resources, money spent on chaplains is money that could have brought-wait for it-around 5000 qualified counselors into our schools.</p>
    
    <p>Chaplains are also accidents waiting to happen, which may be why the Government can&rsquo;t get far enough away from them when legal liability issues are mentioned. In various communications, it stresses that chaplains are not employees of the education department and suggests that the buck stops with school principals, Chaplaincy Service Providers or the school P&amp;C.</p>
    
    <p>So what did our children to deserve our negligence? Nothing. It&rsquo;s just that Labor needs to pick up an additional 1% of the religious vote in Queensland.</p>
    
    <p>Sorry kids.</p>

    <p>Coverage of the federal election in the past week was briefly interrupted by the WikiLeaks saga.</p>
    
    <p>The international transparency and anti-corruption group roused a media storm when it released a compendium of 91,000 classified US reports on the Afghan war.</p>
    
    <p>Among the revelations are that elements in the Pakistani government have been collaborating with the Taliban and that officials have not been honest about the number and cause of civilian casualties.</p>
    
    <p>WikiLeaks, represented by its Australian editor-in-chief Julian Assange, enables citizens to anonymously leak documents that governments and businesses want to keep secret.</p>
    
    <p>In April, WikiLeaks footage of an American helicopter gunning down civilians in Baghdad made headlines around the world. The group also published the secret list of websites the Australian government plans to ban with its proposed internet filter.</p>
    
    <p>As the capacity of WikiLeaks to dictate and dominate the news cycle grows, it has also become the story. Much of the chatter is from journalists, who have traditionally seen it as a competitor and worried that its commando-style, volunteer-dependent approach might be the future of investigative reporting.</p>
    
    <p>Such fears were ameliorated by the handling of the Afghan war documents: WikiLeaks gave three news organisations early access to the documents, which released them alongside their own coverage and analysis. News chiefs saw this approach as an affirmation of the sifting, annotating and interpreting skills of the &ldquo;professional journalist&rdquo;. But amid the backslapping, key moral questions about the WikiLeaks phenomenon have been overlooked.</p>
    
    <p>The group believes transparency brings accountability and secrecy causes corruption. Societies in search of honest institutions and a properly functioning democracy require that powerful governments and corporations put everything on the public record for citizens to analyse and make up their minds. Where they fail in this responsibility, people of conscience must act with organisations such as WikiLeaks to get the truth out.</p>
    
    <p>There is much that is sound in this plan. It is true corruption relies on secrecy and secrecy veils and nurtures corruption. It is correct to say democracy is imperilled when institutions ritually rely on &ldquo;national security&rdquo; and &ldquo;commercial in confidence&rdquo; to withhold information required to ensure corporate or government integrity.</p>
    
    <p>WikiLeaks also issues challenges to the culture of secrecy itself. The ease and security WikiLeaks provides to leakers and the minimalist nature of the site&rsquo;s editorial control encourages leaking. The more leaking there is, the greater the recognition among the powerful that no secret is safe. One sane response to this new reality is for institutions to abandon secrecy as their default mode and operate transparently instead.</p>
    
    <p>This is a citizen&rsquo;s world, one ruled &ndash; with a light touch &ndash; by organisations such as WikiLeaks, but there will be problems. One obvious one is that occasionally there are legitimate reasons for secrecy and privacy.</p>
    
    <p>It&rsquo;s no good to say that decisions about this data can be made collectively. Once information is known, it cannot be unknown.</p>
    
    <p>This leaves WikiLeaks to decide. With power comes responsibility and mistakes have been made. Founder Assange says the organisation will review its procedures and react, though the effect on the guiding philosophy of Wikileaks remains to be seen.</p>

  title: A Few Good Men and Stephen Milne Rape Allegations
  submission_notify_name: 
  submission_intro: 
  content_markup: "<p>Important stories can hit-and develop-at the wrong time. Like in the days leading up to a coup that delivered Australia its first female Prime Minister. Such losses are an inevitable part of an unpredictable news cycle, but sometimes they must be resisted. Some stories are just too important to let fall off the radar.</p>\n\n\
    <p>One such story concerns former Senior Detective Scott Gladman. Gladman was the officer charged with investigating rape allegations made by a 19 year old woman against AFL footballer Stephen Milne six years ago. The case was eventually dropped. In a statement-released at the time and again when the story resurfaced-police said they had concluded on the basis of advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions and the results of &ldquo;a thorough investigation&rdquo; that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the sportsman.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Gladman tells a different tale, one backed up by his fellow investigating officer Mike Smith, another ex-cop. A tale of being hounded and pressured by fellow members of the force to &ldquo;make it go away&rdquo; and not &ldquo;do the job as best you can.&rdquo; A tale of being told the woman was &ldquo;just one of those footy sluts&rdquo; and of police being contacted directly by those with &ldquo;vested interest in the possible outcome for the club.&rdquo; A story of player interview tapes being stolen from desks and transcripts of interview found on a photocopier, and of the alleged-victim&rsquo;s statement being leaked to the club, revealing her identity. And a tale of the senior officers to whom Gladman complained-those in charge of the sexual crimes squad and assistant commissioner of the region at the time-failing to respond to his concerns and do all that they could to make things right.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Thankfully, the Office of Police Integrity are now investigating, with the Chief Commissioner promising to re-open the investigation if allegations that police deliberately sought to compromise it can be proved.</p>\n\n\
    <p>The initial findings of such probes have been explosive, with raids on the criminal investigation unit uncovering the loss of crucial, and mostly irreplaceable, evidence including master tapes of initial interviews, reports from lead investigators and parts of the brief of evidence.</p>\n\n\

  content: "Important stories can hit-and develop-at the wrong time. Like in the days leading up to a coup that delivered Australia its first female Prime Minister. Such losses are an inevitable part of an unpredictable news cycle, but sometimes they must be resisted. Some stories are just too important to let fall off the radar.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    One such story concerns former Senior Detective Scott Gladman. Gladman was the officer charged with investigating rape allegations made by a 19 year old woman against AFL footballer Stephen Milne six years ago. The case was eventually dropped. In a statement-released at the time and again when the story resurfaced-police said they had concluded on the basis of advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions and the results of \"a thorough investigation\" that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the sportsman.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Gladman tells a different tale, one backed up by his fellow investigating officer Mike Smith, another ex-cop. A tale of being hounded and pressured by fellow members of the force to \"make it go away\" and not \"do the job as best you can.\" A tale of being told the woman was \"just one of those footy sluts\" and of police being contacted directly by those with \"vested interest in the possible outcome for the club.\" A story of player interview tapes being stolen from desks and transcripts of interview found on a photocopier, and of the alleged-victim's statement being leaked to the club, revealing her identity. And a tale of the senior officers to whom Gladman complained-those in charge of the sexual crimes squad and assistant commissioner of the region at the time-failing to respond to his concerns and do all that they could to make things right.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Thankfully, the Office of Police Integrity are now investigating, with the Chief Commissioner promising to re-open the investigation if allegations that police deliberately sought to compromise it can be proved.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    The initial findings of such probes have been explosive, with raids on the criminal investigation unit uncovering the loss of crucial, and mostly irreplaceable, evidence including master tapes of initial interviews, reports from lead investigators and parts of the brief of evidence.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    Gladman makes plain that he thinks the case against Milne should have gone ahead, and a jury left to decide the player's guilt or innocence. \"There is a prima facie case still sitting there in that box at that office that should be answered by a jury,\" he said. \"Stephen Milne is an innocent person until he's proven guilty in a court of law. However, we never got that far, because the...natural flow of justice was interrupted.\"\r\n\
    \r\n\
    He said that telling the woman that, \"the brief had been put to bed\" was one of the worst experiences of his career. For colleague Mike Smith, it was a turning point. He says he lost \"...a hell of a lot of faith.\" \xC3\xA2\xE2\x82\xAC\xC2\xA8\r\n\
    \r\n\
    It is this part of the story that moves me most. The startling revelation that in a modern Australian policeforce. there appears no place for these two good men. Indeed, it may be Gladman's and Smith's abundant integrity-demonstrated in their initial pursuit of justice without fear or favour, and their insistence on seeking it again-that makes them such a poor fit with contemporary police culture.\r\n\
    \r\n\
    A culture in which what some cops seem to think matters most is \"to be seen to be more important in their eyes to the club ... [by doing] anything they c[an] ... to help.\"\r\n\

  title: What, No Baby?

  content_markup: |
    <p>What, No Baby? takes us on journey into the lives of contemporary women who plan to have it all &ndash; marriage, motherhood and work &ndash; yet have been derailed by reluctant men, insatiably demanding jobs and ever-climbing expectations of what it takes to be a &ldquo;good&rdquo; mother.</p>
    
    <p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics predicts that 25% of Australian women currently in their reproductive years will never have children. Yet respected researcher and ethicists Leslie Cannold argues that women want to mother as much as they ever did. What has changed is their willingness to sacrifice everything they&rsquo;ve built &ndash; everything they are &ndash; to do so. Drawing on demographic data. social research and insights gained from interviews with women in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, Cannold shows that the easier society makes it for women to combine parenthood and paid work, the closer women get to having the number of children they want.</p>
    
    <p>At the end of the 21st century, it is women&rsquo;s freedom to mother that is most at risk. Guaranteed to reshape the current debate around sustained low fertility, What, no baby? is a must-red for everyone concerned about Australia&rsquo;s fertility rate and for women who want to better understand &ndash; and to solve &ndash; the social problems keeping them from fulfilling lives in which children play a part.</p>

    <p><strong>What Readers are Saying About What, No Baby?</strong></p>
    
    <pre><code>I have just read (rather, devoured) your book "What, No Baby?". I am currently going through a break up with a truly wonderful man, because he is desperate to have children now, while I am 98% decided that I never want them. (In any case, I certainly don't want them "in time" for him.) My indecision has come from a suspicion that there was information I wasn't considering; as you said, the happy parents are deafeningly silent on the positives of having children.
    
    Those parents who do try to convince me I should have children, or that I'll regret it one day, say things like "who will look after you when you're old" and "it's all worth it when they say 'I love you'". Reason one is clearly ridiculous and invalid, while reason two reminds me of friends of mine who have tried to justify remaining in physically abusive relationships. Yet there didn't seem to be any other reasons!
    
    In contrast, your book opened my eyes to considerations that I have not encountered in FOUR YEARS of research through various avenues. I came to question how much of my "choice" is really valid, since in this case I want to be true to my heart, not to my head. I certainly bristle at the realisation that it is to a great extent society that is driving this very personal choice of mine.
    
    Through your book, I've been able to more objectively take apart and reasses the various factors I've considered. Most importantly, I've been able to see through the peripherals to the core of it - the fact remains that I feel no strong desire for motherhood, even with all of those outside influences aside.
    
    In truth I have always felt quite a strong - even physical - aversion to the thought of pregnancy, breast feeding, and especially to the corny gaga roses-and-cottonwool visions of motherhood as a necessary ingredient of true womanhood.
    
    You have helped me to reconsider the validity and true motivations behind my "choice" and in so doing, you have guided me to becoming more sure of my decision, more aware of its repercussions, and better armed in the struggle to be respected by those who prefer to take other paths in life and feel that I should too. You've given me clarity in choosing how to proceed (or not to) in my current relationship and taken away some of the guilt I have felt in not being the "normal, proper and whole" woman that my partner wants me to be.
    
    Finally, after wading through a great deal of militant, stupid and nasty childfree rhetoric which is met by equally militant, stupid and nasty pro-parenting rhetoric, you have been a refreshingly open minded and non-blaming voice amongst the muck of useless bitterness on both sides.
    
    Thank you very much for your measured approach, your inspiring intelligence and your incredibly well balanced and empathic work.

    <p>As H1N1 influenza continues to spread across the world, ABC local radio

    by a pandemic, bio-terror attack or other large-scale disaster?</p>
    
    <p>The Therapeutic Goods Administration has approved an extension to the
    shelf-life of anti-viral drug Tamiflu as well asrationing the drug, and

    measures in response to the possible pandemic.</p>

    Launch\\\n\
    When: Wednesday 23 June, at 5:30 for 6:00\\\n\
    Where: Queen Victoria Women\xE2\x80\x99s Centre</p>\n\n\
    <p>Below is Leslie\xE2\x80\x99s speech from the launch.</p>\n\n\
    <h2>Introduction: 3 things about me that explain why I oppose Abbott</h2>\n\n\
    <p>If you go to my facebook page, you will find under profile the following\n\
    information about me.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Religious Views? Jewish by birth</p>\n\n\
    <p>Political views? I\xE2\x80\x99m a political commentator &ndash; I\xE2\x80\x99ll never tell</p>\n\n\
    <p>If I had my druthers, there would also be a box that said Feminist?\\\n\
    To which I would answer: Hell, yes!</p>\n\n\
    <p>So these are 3 things to know about me:</p>\n\n\
    <ol>\n\
    <li>That I identify as part of a minority population in a theoretically\n\
    multicultural and multi-religious but numerically still Anglo\n\
    Christian culture</li>\n\
    <li>That in my work as a commentator and abortion rights activist I have\n\
    always been non-partisan. In the past I have written or spoken\n\
    critically about Rudd, Conroy, Roxon, Ferguson the NSW Labor\n\
    government, Harradine, Costello, Nelson the Kennett government and\n\
    Abbott-those on all sides of politics without fear or favour-and\n\
    intend to continue on this way; and that</li>\n\
    <li>I am a feminist activist who has mostly worked, largely\n\
    successfully, to expand women\xE2\x80\x99s abortion rights both nationally (At\n\
    President of Reproductive Choice Australia) and in this state (as\n\
    President of Pro Choice Victoria).</li>\n\
    </ol>\n\n\n\
    <p>Why is it important to know this? Because this background, work\n\
    experience and commitment to doing a small corner of the work required\n\
    to differentiate women from doormats goes a long way towards explaining\n\
    why I decided to accept the invitation graciously extended to me by the\n\
    NUS to launch the <em>Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s Heaven, Your Hell</em>. Because however partisan\n\
    this event feels, it is not. It is issue based, and the issues are two:\n\
    religious freedom (which includes the freedom to be free from religion)\n\
    and, flowing from this, female liberation. If you are female, or have\n\
    females in your life who you care about and/or you care about expanding\n\
    the wafer-thin separation between church and state in this country, the\n\
    potential that Tony Abbott might become PM should very much concern you.\n\
    It should concern you regardless of where you normally sit-left, centre\n\
    or right-on the political fence.</p>\n\n\
    <h2>In this Speech</h2>\n\n\
    <p>In the next twenty minutes I\xE2\x80\x99m going to do three things.</p>\n\n\
    <ol>\n\
    <li>Sketch the values and beliefs of Tony Abbott, mostly in his own\n\
    words.</li>\n\
    <li>Use this sketch to explain why it is Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s consistent disregard\n\
    for the separation of church and state that makes his values about\n\
    women so dangerous and;</li>\n\
    <li>Make some suggestions the strategic response required by those of us\n\
    fearful of the prosect of Prime Minister Abbott. Suggestions\n\
    designed not just to defend against this likelihood at the next\n\
    Federal election, but to persuade the Liberals that they remain\n\
    unelectable as long as Abbott leads them.</li>\n\
    </ol>\n\n\n\
    <h2>This is Tony Abbott</h2>\n\n\
    <p>Abbott was born in 1957 and schooled at (Jesuit) St Ignatius College\n\
    before studying for the Priesthood. He subsequently worked as a\n\
    journalist and political press secretary before leading the successful\n\
    campaign against an Australian republic. He has in some instances\n\
    long-standing associations with the National Civic Council, the Lyons\n\
    Forum, the Endeavour Forum and the Australian Christian Lobby.</p>\n\n\
    <h3>Young Women\xE2\x80\x99s Medical Privacy</h3>\n\n\
    <p>In the week the Howard government introduced legislation to give parents\n\
    the right to access data about government benefits (such as Medicare\n\
    items or Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme drugs) provided to their\n\
    teenagers (a move widely acknowledged to be targeted at young women\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    Medicare consults and claim related to contraceptive and abortion\n\
    advice), Federal Health Minister Abbott said:</p>\n\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CThe Government accepts that some 14 and 15-year-olds might prefer that\n\
    their parents not know about the medical procedures they have had or the\n\
    prescription drugs they are on. But children should not be presumed to\n\
    be the best judges of their own long-term interests and should not have\n\
    the right to go behind their parents\xE2\x80\x99 backs \xE2\x80\xA6 If 14 and 15-year-olds are\n\
    determined to defy their parents, there is little anyone can do to stop\n\
    them..[but it is] the responsibility of government &ndash; and doctors &ndash; \xE2\x80\xA6 to\n\
    support parental authority.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <h3>Welcome to Country &amp; the Lord\xE2\x80\x99s Prayer</h3>\n\n\
    <p>Abbott recently described Aboriginal welcome to country ceremonies as a\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cgenuflection to political correctness\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cout-of-place tokenism.\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    However, he (and sadly the government also believes Federal Parliament\n\
    should continue to start the day with the Lord\xE2\x80\x99s Prayer.</p>\n\n\
    <h3>Women &amp; Climate Change</h3>\n\n\
    <p>Abbott believes the \xE2\x80\x9Cargument [on climate change] is absolute crap\xE2\x80\x9D. In\n\
    February this year he make his \xE2\x80\x9Cgreat big new tax\xE2\x80\x9D point about the\n\
    government\xE2\x80\x99s proposed Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) as follows: \xE2\x80\x9CWhat\n\
    the housewives of Australia need to understand as they do the ironing is\n\
    that if they get it done commercially it\xE2\x80\x99s going to go up in price, and\n\
    their own power bills when they switch the iron on, are going to go up.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <h3>Marriage, Divorce and Homosexuality</h3>\n\n\
    <p>Abbott wants to return to at fault-divorce, supporting legislation that\n\
    would require spouses to prove offences like adultery, habitual\n\
    drunkenness or cruelty before they can separate.</p>\n\n\
    <p>He told <em>60 Minutes</em> in what he later described as a \xE2\x80\x9Cspontaneous\n\
    answer\xE2\x80\x9D that homosexuality makes him feel \xE2\x80\x9Ca bit threatened.\xE2\x80\x9D This past\n\
    Monday, he-and sadly the government with him-affirmed his opposition to\n\
    gay marriage by saying that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe marriage relationship is unique and it\n\
    should always be specially recognised.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <h3>Abortion</h3>\n\n\
    <p>Health Minister Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s statements and policies on abortion renewed\n\
    national debate about the issue, which had lain dormant for years. He\n\
    described \xE2\x80\x9Cthe fact that 100,000 [Australian] women choose to end their\n\
    pregnancies\xE2\x80\x9D as a \xE2\x80\x9Cnational tragedy\xE2\x80\x9D that left a \xE2\x80\x9Clegacy of unutterable\n\
    shame.\xE2\x80\x9D He said there was \xE2\x80\x9Ca bizarre double standard\xE2\x80\xA6where someone who\n\
    kills a pregnant woman\xE2\x80\x99s baby is guilty of murder but a woman who aborts\n\
    an unborn baby is simply exercising choice.\xE2\x80\x9D The figure of 100,000, used\n\
    repeatedly throughout the RU486 debate, turned out to be wrong.</p>\n\n\
    <h3>Female virginity and pre-marital sex</h3>\n\n\
    <p>Mr Abbott says his daughters ought regard their virginity as \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\xA6the\n\
    greatest gift that you can give someone, the ultimate gift of giving\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    that they ought not to \xE2\x80\x9Cgive\xE2\x80\xA6to someone lightly.\xE2\x80\x9D He worries about\n\
    pre-marital sex for women: \xE2\x80\x9Cthey should be very careful about doing\n\
    things that they might regret and doing things that might in the long\n\
    run cause them to have less self respect and less respect for others\n\
    than might be the case.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <h3>Separation of Church and State</h3>\n\n\
    <p>At the launch of a collection of B.A. Santamaria\xE2\x80\x99s letters, Abbott\n\
    lauded his mentor for the view that \xE2\x80\x9Cit [is] impossible to be a passive\n\
    Christian.\xE2\x80\x9D Abbott argued that the Howard government\xE2\x80\x99s decisions to\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Coverturn the Northern Territory\xE2\x80\x99s euthanasia law, ban gay marriage,\n\
    stop the ACT heroin trial, provide additional financial support for\n\
    one-income families, and try to reduce abortion numbers through\n\
    pregnancy support counseling\xE2\x80\x9D showed that the \xE2\x80\x9Ceight Catholics\xE2\x80\xA6in\n\
    the\xE2\x80\xA6Cabinet\xE2\x80\x9D had turned the \xE2\x80\x9Ctide of secular humanism.\xE2\x80\x9D</p>\n\n\
    <p>Despite this, he recently implied on ABC\xE2\x80\x99s <em>Q&amp;A</em> that public and media\n\
    interest in his Catholic beliefs was unfair.</p>\n\n\
    <h2>The Problem is not his beliefs, but his imposition of them on us</h2>\n\n\
    <p>Abbott has values that appear little, if no different, to those of the\n\
    Vatican on what that institution defines as moral issues: dying with\n\
    dignity, contraception, abortion, IVF/stem cell research, gay marriage.</p>\n\n\
    <p>However, I want to be clear that it is not the near perfect alignment of\n\
    these views with orthodox Catholicism that make these views so\n\
    politically concerning, <em>but Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s view the he is obliged as an\n\
    active Christian to give effect to these views in law and policies that\n\
    govern us all</em>.</p>\n\n\
    <p>There are people of faith who understand that their religious\n\
    values-sometimes referred to as their conscience-are private. Who\n\
    understand that in the same way that they do not want others to impede\n\
    their capacity to observe and follow the dictates of their own faith or\n\
    conscience, they are duty-bound to refrain from imposing their faith or\n\
    conscience on others. Who believe in the protection of religious\n\
    freedom-a freedom that includes the right not to have faith-through a\n\
    strict separation of church and state.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Abbott is not one of these. He believes that he has a right to live\n\
    according to his faith, and that the rest of us are obliged to live by\n\
    it, too. That we should not make choices about our own bodies and lives\n\
    that offend his morals. This is his claim when he notes the\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cimpossibility of passive Christians\xE2\x80\x9D and boasts about the capacity of\n\
    critical numbers of active Christians in the Howard cabinet to attack\n\
    and halt the progress of laws that would allow others to make different\n\
    choices-based on their own consciences-about health issues critical to\n\
    their lives. This is what he did when he raised abortion as a political\n\
    issue from the dead and for the duration of his tenure as health\n\
    minister; when he forced an entire nation of women to listen to his\n\
    erroneous, ignorant and/or insulting characterisations of women\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    reproductive choices and to work 24/7 to fend off his repeated attempts\n\
    to undermine or restrict them.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Abbott is dangerous not because he is a faithful adherent of a\n\
    particular religious faith. He is dangerous because he uses his power to\n\
    do all he can to ensure not just that his faith rules his life, but our\n\
    lives, too.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This simple fact makes Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s protest about unfair media interest in\n\
    his Catholic faith-referred to by some as evidence of anti-Catholic\n\
    bias-risible. When a politician makes his faith-based commitments the\n\
    cornerstone of his legislative agenda-and then boasts about it-voters\n\
    very much have a right to know exactly what those faith-based views are.\n\
    The media is neither being unfair, or biased against Catholics, but\n\
    simply doing its job. May it continue to do it into the future.</p>\n\n\
    <h2>The challenge of Political Activism in The Goldfish era</h2>\n\n\
    <p>We all know the joke about the goldfish.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Those inside the beltway, the journos, commentators and political\n\
    junkies, think we know all I\xE2\x80\x99ve just told you about Abbott already. That\n\
    it\xE2\x80\x99s old news. Such a view grounded the recent decision of a website\n\
    editor to bury a piece I wrote about the <em>Virile Values of Abbott</em>.\n\
    Despite this, and thanks to my loyal Twitter and Facebook following, the\n\
    article was distributed, read and commented upon widely. Indeed it went\n\
    number one on the website that day. This fact is worthy of note, as are\n\
    the three types of comments this piece, and others I\xE2\x80\x99ve written like it,\n\
    attract.</p>\n\n\
    <h3>Goldfish</h3>\n\n\
    <blockquote><p>Hello Leslie</p>\n\n\
    <p>I just wanted to contact you to say that your article about Tony\n\
    Abbott\xE2\x80\xA6was frightening. I say that as someone who has been fully aware\n\
    of his background and views (none of which I thankfully share) but\n\
    what worries me is that prior to reading your article they had faded\n\
    from my mind.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Perhaps we could take the key points about his beliefs and install\n\
    large sized posters on the backs of buses to remind anyone else that\n\
    might get suckered into his action man good blokey persona.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Thanks for the reminder</p></blockquote>\n\n\
    <p>People forget, but if they could remember, they would not vote for\n\
    Abbott. We need to remind them.</p>\n\n\
    <p>This is tricker than it sounds because reminding doesn\xE2\x80\x99t constitute the\n\
    new-news that is the business of most media outlets. However, it is not\n\
    impossible. Anyone-but-Abbott forces must target community radio,\n\
    community television and organs like <em>OLO</em> and <em>New Matilda</em> if it\n\
    survives. They must use informational websites and social media. I\n\
    imagine a website that generates a quote from Abbott once a day, which\n\
    is then sent out via tweet with a link back to the site for more\n\
    information. Or a link to a <em>You Tube</em> video that highlights all of his\n\
    policies.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Mainstream news coverage might be attracted if a campaign was run like\n\
    the <em>Triple J</em> did years ago where listeners were rewarded for coming up\n\
    with the most innovative and high-profile means of promoting the\n\
    station. We could create a prize pool and run a contest, the winner of\n\
    which will be the woman/women who show the greatest skill in getting\n\
    reminders about the nightmare nature of Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s dreams heard by the\n\
    largest audience.</p>\n\n\
    <h3>Partisan Denialists</h3>\n\n\
    <p>These are the folks that respond to the presentation of dispassionate\n\
    facts about Abbott, in essence the kind of po-faced quoting back I began\n\
    this talk with, as part of an ALP-organised \xE2\x80\x9Cscare campaign\xE2\x80\x9D and even\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cslander\xE2\x80\x9D for which I, as the speaker, ought be prosecuted.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Obviously lost to the Anyone-but-Abbott campaign, I find it\n\
    interestingly how angry those who wish to defend Abbott get when nothing\n\
    more offensive is done than informing the public about what their man &ndash;\n\
    who they proudly boasts stands for something in a way K.Rudd does\n\
    not-thinks. This is, I suspect, because they know how out of touch their\n\
    and Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s views are with the electorate. Another reason to return to\n\
    my first point: we need to remind people who Abbott really is.</p>\n\n\
    <h3>Cynics</h3>\n\n\
    <p><em>\xE2\x80\x9CWhat voters have to do is compare Abbott and Rudd \xE2\x80\xA6 so what does Rudd\n\
    believe in to balance the comparison? Well not much it seems and what he\n\
    does promise he doesn\xE2\x80\x99t deliver.\xE2\x80\x9D</em></p>\n\n\
    <p>It is impossible to run a campaign against Abbott without attracting\n\
    comment about the alternatives. Abbott is working to directly encourage\n\
    cynicism and defeatism-that there is no reason to oppose him because the\n\
    alternative is just as bad, with lines like this:</p>\n\n\
    <p>\xE2\x80\x9CMy views on religion and Kevin Rudd\xE2\x80\x99s views on religion are almost\n\
    identical,\xE2\x80\x9D Mr Abbott said. ``So I don\xE2\x80\x99t see why you have got a\n\
    problem with me when you haven\xE2\x80\x99t got a problem with Kevin Rudd.\"</p>\n\n\
    <p>However, however disappointed one may feel with Rudd, it is not true\n\
    that the two men are similar on the \xE2\x80\x9Clame\xE2\x80\xA6churchy loser\xE2\x80\x9D front. Rudd and\n\
    the Rudd government have evidenced &ndash; for the most part &ndash; a key\n\
    difference with Abbott and the Howard Government. They do not appear\n\
    hell bent on putting most of the PM\xE2\x80\x99s conservative Christian views into\n\
    law. It is a matter of degree, rather than kind admittedly, but it\xE2\x80\x99s a\n\
    kind that matters, and that we must not forget.</p>\n\n\
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\
    <p>There is an element of selfishness in my plea for us to rise up as one,\n\
    and defeat Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s bid to be Australia\xE2\x80\x99s Prime Minister: this time and\n\
    for all time. And it is this: When Abbott was Health Minister, my life\n\
    was hell. I slept poorly and barely had a holiday. Nearly ever other\n\
    week, Abbott would have a thought bubble, many of which became policies,\n\
    bills or law, that had the effect of infantalising or wedging women, or\n\
    scrapping some hard-earned right, that I had to refute or fight.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Obviously, progress on the many fronts on which women are still fighting\n\
    would be impossible with him in charge.</p>\n\n\
    <p>Leopards don\xE2\x80\x99t change their spots. However much his minders seek to\n\
    downplay or disguise the wide swathe of his socially unpalatable views,\n\
    the fact is-and this part of their spin is true-Tony Abbott is what he\n\
    appears to be: a man who seeks to make his conservative Christian values\n\
    the law of the land.</p>\n\n\
    <p>I call on all of us here today to deny Tony Abbott his heaven, and to\n\
    give him hell instead.</p>\n"

    Launch\\\n\
    When: Wednesday 23 June, at 5:30 for 6:00\\\n\
    Where: Queen Victoria Women\xE2\x80\x99s Centre\n\n\
    Below is Leslie\xE2\x80\x99s speech from the launch.\n\n\
    ## Introduction: 3 things about me that explain why I oppose Abbott\n\n\
    If you go to my facebook page, you will find under profile the following\n\
    information about me.\n\n\
    Religious Views? Jewish by birth\n\n\
    Political views? I\xE2\x80\x99m a political commentator - I\xE2\x80\x99ll never tell\n\n\
    If I had my druthers, there would also be a box that said Feminist?\\\n\
    To which I would answer: Hell, yes!\n\n\
    So these are 3 things to know about me:\n\n\
    1.  That I identify as part of a minority population in a theoretically\n    multicultural and multi-religious but numerically still Anglo\n    Christian culture\n\
    2.  That in my work as a commentator and abortion rights activist I have\n    always been non-partisan. In the past I have written or spoken\n    critically about Rudd, Conroy, Roxon, Ferguson the NSW Labor\n    government, Harradine, Costello, Nelson the Kennett government and\n    Abbott-those on all sides of politics without fear or favour-and\n    intend to continue on this way; and that\n\
    3.  I am a feminist activist who has mostly worked, largely\n    successfully, to expand women\xE2\x80\x99s abortion rights both nationally (At\n    President of Reproductive Choice Australia) and in this state (as\n    President of Pro Choice Victoria).\n\n\
    Why is it important to know this? Because this background, work\n\
    experience and commitment to doing a small corner of the work required\n\
    to differentiate women from doormats goes a long way towards explaining\n\
    why I decided to accept the invitation graciously extended to me by the\n\
    NUS to launch the *Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s Heaven, Your Hell*. Because however partisan\n\
    this event feels, it is not. It is issue based, and the issues are two:\n\
    religious freedom (which includes the freedom to be free from religion)\n\
    and, flowing from this, female liberation. If you are female, or have\n\
    females in your life who you care about and/or you care about expanding\n\
    the wafer-thin separation between church and state in this country, the\n\
    potential that Tony Abbott might become PM should very much concern you.\n\
    It should concern you regardless of where you normally sit-left, centre\n\
    or right-on the political fence.\n\n\
    ## In this Speech\n\n\
    In the next twenty minutes I\xE2\x80\x99m going to do three things.\n\n\
    1.  Sketch the values and beliefs of Tony Abbott, mostly in his own\n    words.\n\
    2.  Use this sketch to explain why it is Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s consistent disregard\n    for the separation of church and state that makes his values about\n    women so dangerous and;\n\
    3.  Make some suggestions the strategic response required by those of us\n    fearful of the prosect of Prime Minister Abbott. Suggestions\n    designed not just to defend against this likelihood at the next\n    Federal election, but to persuade the Liberals that they remain\n    unelectable as long as Abbott leads them.\n\n\
    ## This is Tony Abbott\n\n\
    Abbott was born in 1957 and schooled at (Jesuit) St Ignatius College\n\
    before studying for the Priesthood. He subsequently worked as a\n\
    journalist and political press secretary before leading the successful\n\
    campaign against an Australian republic. He has in some instances\n\
    long-standing associations with the National Civic Council, the Lyons\n\
    Forum, the Endeavour Forum and the Australian Christian Lobby.\n\n\
    ### Young Women\xE2\x80\x99s Medical Privacy\n\n\
    In the week the Howard government introduced legislation to give parents\n\
    the right to access data about government benefits (such as Medicare\n\
    items or Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme drugs) provided to their\n\
    teenagers (a move widely acknowledged to be targeted at young women\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    Medicare consults and claim related to contraceptive and abortion\n\
    advice), Federal Health Minister Abbott said:\n\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CThe Government accepts that some 14 and 15-year-olds might prefer that\n\
    their parents not know about the medical procedures they have had or the\n\
    prescription drugs they are on. But children should not be presumed to\n\
    be the best judges of their own long-term interests and should not have\n\
    the right to go behind their parents\xE2\x80\x99 backs \xE2\x80\xA6 If 14 and 15-year-olds are\n\
    determined to defy their parents, there is little anyone can do to stop\n\
    them..[but it is] the responsibility of government - and doctors - \xE2\x80\xA6 to\n\
    support parental authority.\xE2\x80\x9D\n\n\
    ### Welcome to Country & the Lord\xE2\x80\x99s Prayer\n\n\
    Abbott recently described Aboriginal welcome to country ceremonies as a\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cgenuflection to political correctness\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cout-of-place tokenism.\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    However, he (and sadly the government also believes Federal Parliament\n\
    should continue to start the day with the Lord\xE2\x80\x99s Prayer.\n\n\
    ### Women & Climate Change\n\n\
    Abbott believes the \xE2\x80\x9Cargument [on climate change] is absolute crap\xE2\x80\x9D. In\n\
    February this year he make his \xE2\x80\x9Cgreat big new tax\xE2\x80\x9D point about the\n\
    government\xE2\x80\x99s proposed Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) as follows: \xE2\x80\x9CWhat\n\
    the housewives of Australia need to understand as they do the ironing is\n\
    that if they get it done commercially it\xE2\x80\x99s going to go up in price, and\n\
    their own power bills when they switch the iron on, are going to go up.\xE2\x80\x9D\n\n\
    ### Marriage, Divorce and Homosexuality\n\n\
    Abbott wants to return to at fault-divorce, supporting legislation that\n\
    would require spouses to prove offences like adultery, habitual\n\
    drunkenness or cruelty before they can separate.\n\n\
    He told *60 Minutes* in what he later described as a \xE2\x80\x9Cspontaneous\n\
    answer\xE2\x80\x9D that homosexuality makes him feel \xE2\x80\x9Ca bit threatened.\xE2\x80\x9D This past\n\
    Monday, he-and sadly the government with him-affirmed his opposition to\n\
    gay marriage by saying that \xE2\x80\x9Cthe marriage relationship is unique and it\n\
    should always be specially recognised.\xE2\x80\x9D\n\n\
    ### Abortion\n\n\
    Health Minister Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s statements and policies on abortion renewed\n\
    national debate about the issue, which had lain dormant for years. He\n\
    described \xE2\x80\x9Cthe fact that 100,000 [Australian] women choose to end their\n\
    pregnancies\xE2\x80\x9D as a \xE2\x80\x9Cnational tragedy\xE2\x80\x9D that left a \xE2\x80\x9Clegacy of unutterable\n\
    shame.\xE2\x80\x9D He said there was \xE2\x80\x9Ca bizarre double standard\xE2\x80\xA6where someone who\n\
    kills a pregnant woman\xE2\x80\x99s baby is guilty of murder but a woman who aborts\n\
    an unborn baby is simply exercising choice.\xE2\x80\x9D The figure of 100,000, used\n\
    repeatedly throughout the RU486 debate, turned out to be wrong.\n\n\
    ### Female virginity and pre-marital sex\n\n\
    Mr Abbott says his daughters ought regard their virginity as \xE2\x80\x9C\xE2\x80\xA6the\n\
    greatest gift that you can give someone, the ultimate gift of giving\xE2\x80\x9D\n\
    that they ought not to \xE2\x80\x9Cgive\xE2\x80\xA6to someone lightly.\xE2\x80\x9D He worries about\n\
    pre-marital sex for women: \xE2\x80\x9Cthey should be very careful about doing\n\
    things that they might regret and doing things that might in the long\n\
    run cause them to have less self respect and less respect for others\n\
    than might be the case.\xE2\x80\x9D\n\n\
    ### Separation of Church and State\n\n\
    At the launch of a collection of B.A. Santamaria\xE2\x80\x99s letters, Abbott\n\
    lauded his mentor for the view that \xE2\x80\x9Cit [is] impossible to be a passive\n\
    Christian.\xE2\x80\x9D Abbott argued that the Howard government\xE2\x80\x99s decisions to\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Coverturn the Northern Territory\xE2\x80\x99s euthanasia law, ban gay marriage,\n\
    stop the ACT heroin trial, provide additional financial support for\n\
    one-income families, and try to reduce abortion numbers through\n\
    pregnancy support counseling\xE2\x80\x9D showed that the \xE2\x80\x9Ceight Catholics\xE2\x80\xA6in\n\
    the\xE2\x80\xA6Cabinet\xE2\x80\x9D had turned the \xE2\x80\x9Ctide of secular humanism.\xE2\x80\x9D\n\n\
    Despite this, he recently implied on ABC\xE2\x80\x99s *Q&A* that public and media\n\
    interest in his Catholic beliefs was unfair.\n\n\
    ## The Problem is not his beliefs, but his imposition of them on us\n\n\
    Abbott has values that appear little, if no different, to those of the\n\
    Vatican on what that institution defines as moral issues: dying with\n\
    dignity, contraception, abortion, IVF/stem cell research, gay marriage.\n\n\
    However, I want to be clear that it is not the near perfect alignment of\n\
    these views with orthodox Catholicism that make these views so\n\
    politically concerning, *but Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s view the he is obliged as an\n\
    active Christian to give effect to these views in law and policies that\n\
    govern us all*.\n\n\
    There are people of faith who understand that their religious\n\
    values-sometimes referred to as their conscience-are private. Who\n\
    understand that in the same way that they do not want others to impede\n\
    their capacity to observe and follow the dictates of their own faith or\n\
    conscience, they are duty-bound to refrain from imposing their faith or\n\
    conscience on others. Who believe in the protection of religious\n\
    freedom-a freedom that includes the right not to have faith-through a\n\
    strict separation of church and state.\n\n\
    Abbott is not one of these. He believes that he has a right to live\n\
    according to his faith, and that the rest of us are obliged to live by\n\
    it, too. That we should not make choices about our own bodies and lives\n\
    that offend his morals. This is his claim when he notes the\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cimpossibility of passive Christians\xE2\x80\x9D and boasts about the capacity of\n\
    critical numbers of active Christians in the Howard cabinet to attack\n\
    and halt the progress of laws that would allow others to make different\n\
    choices-based on their own consciences-about health issues critical to\n\
    their lives. This is what he did when he raised abortion as a political\n\
    issue from the dead and for the duration of his tenure as health\n\
    minister; when he forced an entire nation of women to listen to his\n\
    erroneous, ignorant and/or insulting characterisations of women\xE2\x80\x99s\n\
    reproductive choices and to work 24/7 to fend off his repeated attempts\n\
    to undermine or restrict them.\n\n\
    Abbott is dangerous not because he is a faithful adherent of a\n\
    particular religious faith. He is dangerous because he uses his power to\n\
    do all he can to ensure not just that his faith rules his life, but our\n\
    lives, too.\n\n\
    This simple fact makes Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s protest about unfair media interest in\n\
    his Catholic faith-referred to by some as evidence of anti-Catholic\n\
    bias-risible. When a politician makes his faith-based commitments the\n\
    cornerstone of his legislative agenda-and then boasts about it-voters\n\
    very much have a right to know exactly what those faith-based views are.\n\
    The media is neither being unfair, or biased against Catholics, but\n\
    simply doing its job. May it continue to do it into the future.\n\n\
    ## The challenge of Political Activism in The Goldfish era\n\n\
    We all know the joke about the goldfish.\n\n\
    Those inside the beltway, the journos, commentators and political\n\
    junkies, think we know all I\xE2\x80\x99ve just told you about Abbott already. That\n\
    it\xE2\x80\x99s old news. Such a view grounded the recent decision of a website\n\
    editor to bury a piece I wrote about the *Virile Values of Abbott*.\n\
    Despite this, and thanks to my loyal Twitter and Facebook following, the\n\
    article was distributed, read and commented upon widely. Indeed it went\n\
    number one on the website that day. This fact is worthy of note, as are\n\
    the three types of comments this piece, and others I\xE2\x80\x99ve written like it,\n\
    attract.\n\n\
    ### Goldfish\n\n\
    > Hello Leslie\n\n\
    > I just wanted to contact you to say that your article about Tony\n\
    > Abbott\xE2\x80\xA6was frightening. I say that as someone who has been fully aware\n\
    > of his background and views (none of which I thankfully share) but\n\
    > what worries me is that prior to reading your article they had faded\n\
    > from my mind.\n\n\
    > Perhaps we could take the key points about his beliefs and install\n\
    > large sized posters on the backs of buses to remind anyone else that\n\
    > might get suckered into his action man good blokey persona.\n\n\
    > Thanks for the reminder\n\n\
    People forget, but if they could remember, they would not vote for\n\
    Abbott. We need to remind them.\n\n\
    This is tricker than it sounds because reminding doesn\xE2\x80\x99t constitute the\n\
    new-news that is the business of most media outlets. However, it is not\n\
    impossible. Anyone-but-Abbott forces must target community radio,\n\
    community television and organs like *OLO* and *New Matilda* if it\n\
    survives. They must use informational websites and social media. I\n\
    imagine a website that generates a quote from Abbott once a day, which\n\
    is then sent out via tweet with a link back to the site for more\n\
    information. Or a link to a *You Tube* video that highlights all of his\n\
    policies.\n\n\
    Mainstream news coverage might be attracted if a campaign was run like\n\
    the *Triple J* did years ago where listeners were rewarded for coming up\n\
    with the most innovative and high-profile means of promoting the\n\
    station. We could create a prize pool and run a contest, the winner of\n\
    which will be the woman/women who show the greatest skill in getting\n\
    reminders about the nightmare nature of Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s dreams heard by the\n\
    largest audience.\n\n\
    ### Partisan Denialists\n\n\
    These are the folks that respond to the presentation of dispassionate\n\
    facts about Abbott, in essence the kind of po-faced quoting back I began\n\
    this talk with, as part of an ALP-organised \xE2\x80\x9Cscare campaign\xE2\x80\x9D and even\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9Cslander\xE2\x80\x9D for which I, as the speaker, ought be prosecuted.\n\n\
    Obviously lost to the Anyone-but-Abbott campaign, I find it\n\
    interestingly how angry those who wish to defend Abbott get when nothing\n\
    more offensive is done than informing the public about what their man -\n\
    who they proudly boasts stands for something in a way K.Rudd does\n\
    not-thinks. This is, I suspect, because they know how out of touch their\n\
    and Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s views are with the electorate. Another reason to return to\n\
    my first point: we need to remind people who Abbott really is.\n\n\
    ### Cynics\n\n\
    *\xE2\x80\x9CWhat voters have to do is compare Abbott and Rudd \xE2\x80\xA6 so what does Rudd\n\
    believe in to balance the comparison? Well not much it seems and what he\n\
    does promise he doesn\xE2\x80\x99t deliver.\xE2\x80\x9D*\n\n\
    It is impossible to run a campaign against Abbott without attracting\n\
    comment about the alternatives. Abbott is working to directly encourage\n\
    cynicism and defeatism-that there is no reason to oppose him because the\n\
    alternative is just as bad, with lines like this:\n\n\
    \xE2\x80\x9CMy views on religion and Kevin Rudd\xE2\x80\x99s views on religion are almost\n\
    identical,\xE2\x80\x9D Mr Abbott said. \\`\\`So I don\xE2\x80\x99t see why you have got a\n\
    problem with me when you haven\xE2\x80\x99t got a problem with Kevin Rudd.\"\n\n\
    However, however disappointed one may feel with Rudd, it is not true\n\
    that the two men are similar on the \xE2\x80\x9Clame\xE2\x80\xA6churchy loser\xE2\x80\x9D front. Rudd and\n\
    the Rudd government have evidenced - for the most part - a key\n\
    difference with Abbott and the Howard Government. They do not appear\n\
    hell bent on putting most of the PM\xE2\x80\x99s conservative Christian views into\n\
    law. It is a matter of degree, rather than kind admittedly, but it\xE2\x80\x99s a\n\
    kind that matters, and that we must not forget.\n\n\
    ## Conclusion\n\n\
    There is an element of selfishness in my plea for us to rise up as one,\n\
    and defeat Abbott\xE2\x80\x99s bid to be Australia\xE2\x80\x99s Prime Minister: this time and\n\
    for all time. And it is this: When Abbott was Health Minister, my life\n\
    was hell. I slept poorly and barely had a holiday. Nearly ever other\n\
    week, Abbott would have a thought bubble, many of which became policies,\n\
    bills or law, that had the effect of infantalising or wedging women, or\n\
    scrapping some hard-earned right, that I had to refute or fight.\n\n\
    Obviously, progress on the many fronts on which women are still fighting\n\
    would be impossible with him in charge.\n\n\
    Leopards don\xE2\x80\x99t change their spots. However much his minders seek to\n\
    downplay or disguise the wide swathe of his socially unpalatable views,\n\
    the fact is-and this part of their spin is true-Tony Abbott is what he\n\
    appears to be: a man who seeks to make his conservative Christian values\n\
    the law of the land.\n\n\
    I call on all of us here today to deny Tony Abbott his heaven, and to\n\
    give him hell instead."
