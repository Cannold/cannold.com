# The site rules.rb file is used to override Blueprint default behaviour for
# a particular site. There are a few scenarios:
#
# == URL Rewriting
#
# You can define url patterns that will redirect to a different URL. These
# take precedence over page-slug routing, but will not override /admin or
# /static URLs.
#
# It's pretty straightforward -- just pass a regex and a replacement string 
# hash pair to the +rewrite+ method. Any URL that matches the regex will have 
# the replacement string *gsubbed* in, and a 301 redirect will be issued.
#
# Eg:
#
#   rewrite /^\/feed\.xml/ => '/in-words/feed'
#   rewrite /^\/artists\/\d+-(.*)/ => '/artists/\1'
#   rewrite /^\/apartamento\/?$/ =>  'shop/tag/apartamento'
#
#
# == Contexts and rules
#
# Rules are 'invoked' at certain points in the Blueprint controller logic to
# override default behaviour. For example, the News blueprint module has
# a default pagination size of 10 posts per page. If you want to have 20 posts
# per page, the News blueprint will let you override this value by explicitly
# invoking rules defined in this file.
#
# Every rule has a 'context', which is the page or pages to which it applies.
# The +context+ method takes two arguments -- a blueprint code and a page slug.
# If you want rules within a particular context to apply to all pages of a 
# particular blueprint type, use a page slug of :all (this is the default).
#
# In our example, this is the rule that would change the pagination size
# for all News pages on the site:
#
#   context 'nws' do
#     rule :pagination_size do 
#       20
#     end
#   end
#       
# Or, more concisely in this case:
#
#   context('nws') { rule(:pagination_size) { 20 } }
#
# Any context can house multiple rules. Where two rules match for a particular
# invocation, both are invoked, but only the last value is returned to the 
# caller.
#
# So, what rule names are used by which blueprint modules? At the moment, the
# best way to find out is to search the blueprints/ folder for "invoke_rule".
# If you have ack installed, run: ack invoke_rule blueprints/
#
