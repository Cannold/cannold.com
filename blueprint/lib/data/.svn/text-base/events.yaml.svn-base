  As H1N1 influenza continues to spread across the world, ABC local radio
  around Australia asks: how Australia would cope if it were hit right now
  by a pandemic, bio-terror attack or other large-scale disaster?
  
  The Therapeutic Goods Administration has approved an extension to the
  shelf-life of anti-viral drug Tamiflu as well asrationing the drug, and
  the Federal Government quickly brought in additional border protection
  measures in response to the possible pandemic.
  
  Would this be enough to stop a major pandemic?
  
  While both State and Federal Governments say they have been planning for
  the worst, some critics say Australia is underprepared.
  
  Others say that what Australia does within its own borders is futile
  unless there is a global effort to help poorer countries improve their
  own health services.
  
  So what lessons can be learned from the swine-flu experience?

  What: National Union of Students’ “Abbott’s Heaven, Your Hell” Campaign
  Launch\
  When: Wednesday 23 June, at 5:30 for 6:00\
  Where: Queen Victoria Women’s Centre
  
  Below is Leslie’s speech from the launch.
  
  ## Introduction: 3 things about me that explain why I oppose Abbott
  
  If you go to my facebook page, you will find under profile the following
  information about me.
  
  Religious Views? Jewish by birth
  
  Political views? I’m a political commentator - I’ll never tell
  
  If I had my druthers, there would also be a box that said Feminist?\
  To which I would answer: Hell, yes!
  
  So these are 3 things to know about me:
  
  1.  That I identify as part of a minority population in a theoretically
      multicultural and multi-religious but numerically still Anglo
      Christian culture
  2.  That in my work as a commentator and abortion rights activist I have
      always been non-partisan. In the past I have written or spoken
      critically about Rudd, Conroy, Roxon, Ferguson the NSW Labor
      government, Harradine, Costello, Nelson the Kennett government and
      Abbott-those on all sides of politics without fear or favour-and
      intend to continue on this way; and that
  3.  I am a feminist activist who has mostly worked, largely
      successfully, to expand women’s abortion rights both nationally (At
      President of Reproductive Choice Australia) and in this state (as
      President of Pro Choice Victoria).
  
  Why is it important to know this? Because this background, work
  experience and commitment to doing a small corner of the work required
  to differentiate women from doormats goes a long way towards explaining
  why I decided to accept the invitation graciously extended to me by the
  NUS to launch the *Abbott’s Heaven, Your Hell*. Because however partisan
  this event feels, it is not. It is issue based, and the issues are two:
  religious freedom (which includes the freedom to be free from religion)
  and, flowing from this, female liberation. If you are female, or have
  females in your life who you care about and/or you care about expanding
  the wafer-thin separation between church and state in this country, the
  potential that Tony Abbott might become PM should very much concern you.
  It should concern you regardless of where you normally sit-left, centre
  or right-on the political fence.
  
  ## In this Speech
  
  In the next twenty minutes I’m going to do three things.
  
  1.  Sketch the values and beliefs of Tony Abbott, mostly in his own
      words.
  2.  Use this sketch to explain why it is Abbott’s consistent disregard
      for the separation of church and state that makes his values about
      women so dangerous and;
  3.  Make some suggestions the strategic response required by those of us
      fearful of the prosect of Prime Minister Abbott. Suggestions
      designed not just to defend against this likelihood at the next
      Federal election, but to persuade the Liberals that they remain
      unelectable as long as Abbott leads them.
  
  ## This is Tony Abbott
  
  Abbott was born in 1957 and schooled at (Jesuit) St Ignatius College
  before studying for the Priesthood. He subsequently worked as a
  journalist and political press secretary before leading the successful
  campaign against an Australian republic. He has in some instances
  long-standing associations with the National Civic Council, the Lyons
  Forum, the Endeavour Forum and the Australian Christian Lobby.
  
  ### Young Women’s Medical Privacy
  
  In the week the Howard government introduced legislation to give parents
  the right to access data about government benefits (such as Medicare
  items or Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme drugs) provided to their
  teenagers (a move widely acknowledged to be targeted at young women’s
  Medicare consults and claim related to contraceptive and abortion
  advice), Federal Health Minister Abbott said:
  
  “The Government accepts that some 14 and 15-year-olds might prefer that
  their parents not know about the medical procedures they have had or the
  prescription drugs they are on. But children should not be presumed to
  be the best judges of their own long-term interests and should not have
  the right to go behind their parents’ backs … If 14 and 15-year-olds are
  determined to defy their parents, there is little anyone can do to stop
  them..[but it is] the responsibility of government - and doctors - … to
  support parental authority.”
  
  ### Welcome to Country & the Lord’s Prayer
  
  Abbott recently described Aboriginal welcome to country ceremonies as a
  “genuflection to political correctness” and “out-of-place tokenism.”
  However, he (and sadly the government also believes Federal Parliament
  should continue to start the day with the Lord’s Prayer.
  
  ### Women & Climate Change
  
  Abbott believes the “argument [on climate change] is absolute crap”. In
  February this year he make his “great big new tax” point about the
  government’s proposed Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) as follows: “What
  the housewives of Australia need to understand as they do the ironing is
  that if they get it done commercially it’s going to go up in price, and
  their own power bills when they switch the iron on, are going to go up.”
  
  ### Marriage, Divorce and Homosexuality
  
  Abbott wants to return to at fault-divorce, supporting legislation that
  would require spouses to prove offences like adultery, habitual
  drunkenness or cruelty before they can separate.
  
  He told *60 Minutes* in what he later described as a “spontaneous
  answer” that homosexuality makes him feel “a bit threatened.” This past
  Monday, he-and sadly the government with him-affirmed his opposition to
  gay marriage by saying that “the marriage relationship is unique and it
  should always be specially recognised.”
  
  ### Abortion
  
  Health Minister Abbott’s statements and policies on abortion renewed
  national debate about the issue, which had lain dormant for years. He
  described “the fact that 100,000 [Australian] women choose to end their
  pregnancies” as a “national tragedy” that left a “legacy of unutterable
  shame.” He said there was “a bizarre double standard…where someone who
  kills a pregnant woman’s baby is guilty of murder but a woman who aborts
  an unborn baby is simply exercising choice.” The figure of 100,000, used
  repeatedly throughout the RU486 debate, turned out to be wrong.
  
  ### Female virginity and pre-marital sex
  
  Mr Abbott says his daughters ought regard their virginity as “…the
  greatest gift that you can give someone, the ultimate gift of giving”
  that they ought not to “give…to someone lightly.” He worries about
  pre-marital sex for women: “they should be very careful about doing
  things that they might regret and doing things that might in the long
  run cause them to have less self respect and less respect for others
  than might be the case.”
  
  ### Separation of Church and State
  
  At the launch of a collection of B.A. Santamaria’s letters, Abbott
  lauded his mentor for the view that “it [is] impossible to be a passive
  Christian.” Abbott argued that the Howard government’s decisions to
  “overturn the Northern Territory’s euthanasia law, ban gay marriage,
  stop the ACT heroin trial, provide additional financial support for
  one-income families, and try to reduce abortion numbers through
  pregnancy support counseling” showed that the “eight Catholics…in
  the…Cabinet” had turned the “tide of secular humanism.”
  
  Despite this, he recently implied on ABC’s *Q&A* that public and media
  interest in his Catholic beliefs was unfair.
  
  ## The Problem is not his beliefs, but his imposition of them on us
  
  Abbott has values that appear little, if no different, to those of the
  Vatican on what that institution defines as moral issues: dying with
  dignity, contraception, abortion, IVF/stem cell research, gay marriage.
  
  However, I want to be clear that it is not the near perfect alignment of
  these views with orthodox Catholicism that make these views so
  politically concerning, *but Abbott’s view the he is obliged as an
  active Christian to give effect to these views in law and policies that
  govern us all*.
  
  There are people of faith who understand that their religious
  values-sometimes referred to as their conscience-are private. Who
  understand that in the same way that they do not want others to impede
  their capacity to observe and follow the dictates of their own faith or
  conscience, they are duty-bound to refrain from imposing their faith or
  conscience on others. Who believe in the protection of religious
  freedom-a freedom that includes the right not to have faith-through a
  strict separation of church and state.
  
  Abbott is not one of these. He believes that he has a right to live
  according to his faith, and that the rest of us are obliged to live by
  it, too. That we should not make choices about our own bodies and lives
  that offend his morals. This is his claim when he notes the
  “impossibility of passive Christians” and boasts about the capacity of
  critical numbers of active Christians in the Howard cabinet to attack
  and halt the progress of laws that would allow others to make different
  choices-based on their own consciences-about health issues critical to
  their lives. This is what he did when he raised abortion as a political
  issue from the dead and for the duration of his tenure as health
  minister; when he forced an entire nation of women to listen to his
  erroneous, ignorant and/or insulting characterisations of women’s
  reproductive choices and to work 24/7 to fend off his repeated attempts
  to undermine or restrict them.
  
  Abbott is dangerous not because he is a faithful adherent of a
  particular religious faith. He is dangerous because he uses his power to
  do all he can to ensure not just that his faith rules his life, but our
  lives, too.
  
  This simple fact makes Abbott’s protest about unfair media interest in
  his Catholic faith-referred to by some as evidence of anti-Catholic
  bias-risible. When a politician makes his faith-based commitments the
  cornerstone of his legislative agenda-and then boasts about it-voters
  very much have a right to know exactly what those faith-based views are.
  The media is neither being unfair, or biased against Catholics, but
  simply doing its job. May it continue to do it into the future.
  
  ## The challenge of Political Activism in The Goldfish era
  
  We all know the joke about the goldfish.
  
  Those inside the beltway, the journos, commentators and political
  junkies, think we know all I’ve just told you about Abbott already. That
  it’s old news. Such a view grounded the recent decision of a website
  editor to bury a piece I wrote about the *Virile Values of Abbott*.
  Despite this, and thanks to my loyal Twitter and Facebook following, the
  article was distributed, read and commented upon widely. Indeed it went
  number one on the website that day. This fact is worthy of note, as are
  the three types of comments this piece, and others I’ve written like it,
  attract.
  
  ### Goldfish
  
  > Hello Leslie
  
  > I just wanted to contact you to say that your article about Tony
  > Abbott…was frightening. I say that as someone who has been fully aware
  > of his background and views (none of which I thankfully share) but
  > what worries me is that prior to reading your article they had faded
  > from my mind.
  
  > Perhaps we could take the key points about his beliefs and install
  > large sized posters on the backs of buses to remind anyone else that
  > might get suckered into his action man good blokey persona.
  
  > Thanks for the reminder
  
  People forget, but if they could remember, they would not vote for
  Abbott. We need to remind them.
  
  This is tricker than it sounds because reminding doesn’t constitute the
  new-news that is the business of most media outlets. However, it is not
  impossible. Anyone-but-Abbott forces must target community radio,
  community television and organs like *OLO* and *New Matilda* if it
  survives. They must use informational websites and social media. I
  imagine a website that generates a quote from Abbott once a day, which
  is then sent out via tweet with a link back to the site for more
  information. Or a link to a *You Tube* video that highlights all of his
  policies.
  
  Mainstream news coverage might be attracted if a campaign was run like
  the *Triple J* did years ago where listeners were rewarded for coming up
  with the most innovative and high-profile means of promoting the
  station. We could create a prize pool and run a contest, the winner of
  which will be the woman/women who show the greatest skill in getting
  reminders about the nightmare nature of Abbott’s dreams heard by the
  largest audience.
  
  ### Partisan Denialists
  
  These are the folks that respond to the presentation of dispassionate
  facts about Abbott, in essence the kind of po-faced quoting back I began
  this talk with, as part of an ALP-organised “scare campaign” and even
  “slander” for which I, as the speaker, ought be prosecuted.
  
  Obviously lost to the Anyone-but-Abbott campaign, I find it
  interestingly how angry those who wish to defend Abbott get when nothing
  more offensive is done than informing the public about what their man -
  who they proudly boasts stands for something in a way K.Rudd does
  not-thinks. This is, I suspect, because they know how out of touch their
  and Abbott’s views are with the electorate. Another reason to return to
  my first point: we need to remind people who Abbott really is.
  
  ### Cynics
  
  *“What voters have to do is compare Abbott and Rudd … so what does Rudd
  believe in to balance the comparison? Well not much it seems and what he
  does promise he doesn’t deliver.”*
  
  It is impossible to run a campaign against Abbott without attracting
  comment about the alternatives. Abbott is working to directly encourage
  cynicism and defeatism-that there is no reason to oppose him because the
  alternative is just as bad, with lines like this:
  
  “My views on religion and Kevin Rudd’s views on religion are almost
  identical,” Mr Abbott said. \`\`So I don’t see why you have got a
  problem with me when you haven’t got a problem with Kevin Rudd."
  
  However, however disappointed one may feel with Rudd, it is not true
  that the two men are similar on the “lame…churchy loser” front. Rudd and
  the Rudd government have evidenced - for the most part - a key
  difference with Abbott and the Howard Government. They do not appear
  hell bent on putting most of the PM’s conservative Christian views into
  law. It is a matter of degree, rather than kind admittedly, but it’s a
  kind that matters, and that we must not forget.
  
  ## Conclusion
  
  There is an element of selfishness in my plea for us to rise up as one,
  and defeat Abbott’s bid to be Australia’s Prime Minister: this time and
  for all time. And it is this: When Abbott was Health Minister, my life
  was hell. I slept poorly and barely had a holiday. Nearly ever other
  week, Abbott would have a thought bubble, many of which became policies,
  bills or law, that had the effect of infantalising or wedging women, or
  scrapping some hard-earned right, that I had to refute or fight.
  
  Obviously, progress on the many fronts on which women are still fighting
  would be impossible with him in charge.
  
  Leopards don’t change their spots. However much his minders seek to
  downplay or disguise the wide swathe of his socially unpalatable views,
  the fact is-and this part of their spin is true-Tony Abbott is what he
  appears to be: a man who seeks to make his conservative Christian values
  the law of the land.
  
  I call on all of us here today to deny Tony Abbott his heaven, and to
  give him hell instead.

  Leslie is Centre Stage with Dr Peter Vardy and Assoc Prof Zeki
  Saritoprak in a St James Ethics Centre and ISRA co-production.
  
  Religion is blamed for great suffering, oppression, wars and hatred
  throughout history. Many horrific acts have been undertaken in the name
  of religion.Yet, religion at its best has brought out greatness in
  humanity at the individual and social life through expressions of self
  sacrifice, love and compassion. Religion has produced spiritual,
  intellectual and insightful individuals expressing themselves through
  art, literature and science. ‘Good’ and ‘bad’ religion seems to exist
  across all religions. Is it the religion or human nature at play? In
  this centre stage discussion, we will explore factors that cause
  religion to be used as a means for excellence or destruction

  Simon Longstaff \
