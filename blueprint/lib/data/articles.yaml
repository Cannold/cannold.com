  Why both women and men resent this modern parable.
  
  WE MAY think we know the real story behind this week’s report that
  67-year-old billionaire media magnate Rupert Murdoch intends to marry
  his 31-year-old girlfriend Wendy Deng after he divorces Anna Murdoch.
  But what do we know, and what do we think we know, about the
  relationship between Murdoch and Deng? And is it truth or perception
  that matters in public interpretation and comment about the impending
  marriage?
  
  Let’s get one thing clear. No one, except perhaps those in Murdoch’s and
  Deng’s inner circle, actually knows much about the relationship. Yet
  many of us think we know that it forms another chapter in a sorry
  late–20th-century cultural tale, in which ageing rich men abandon their
  similarly ageing wives for younger, attractive women. (Remember Paul
  Hogan and Donald Trump.) The women who form such relationships are
  similarly seen to be engaged in an unholy system of barter in which they
  trade their youth and beauty for a share of their new husband’s power
  and money (a la Anna Nicole Smith and Rose Hancock).
  
  Rather than speculate on whether the Murdoch-Deng relationship conforms
  to this stereotype, I would like to examine the assumptions and
  anxieties that underlie and fuel it.
  
  The Billionaire and His Younger New Wife parable generates anxiety for
  both men and women. For many women, the dominant concern is that men
  value them only for their transient attributes of youth and beauty. An
  additional female apprehension, explicitly read into Paul Hogan’s
  marital break-up, is that while it is the “old” wife who contributes to
  their husband’s rise to fame and fortune, it is the new wife who reaps
  the rewards. Many men feel similarly devalued by the Billionaire tale,
  believing it wrong for a woman to marry a man for his money.
  
  For both men and women, what is being devalued in the Billionaire tale
  is love. Middle-class views of marriage hold that it ought to be a
  lifelong commitment. We are meant to love the other for who they are,
  not for what they have. Our obligations in marriage are to fulfil our
  partner’s desire for love, not for more prosaic human needs and emotions
  such as money and power.
  
  But how realistic is this view of marriage? Several recent studies
  (including Birrell and Rapson, on this page on 22 October) suggest that
  declines in marriage rates owe much to a drop-off of coupling among the
  working classes. In the past, working-class women traded their work in
  the home and raising of children in exchange for a share of their
  partner’s income. Yet rising unemployment has meant that many
  working-class men can no longer keep the bargain.
  
  Many working-class men and women have seen marriage as a way of pooling
  scarce resources to achieve shared goals, such as children and economic
  survival. This isn’t to say that the partners in these marriages don’t
  love each other, but that the basis of the marriage is not love, but
  reciprocal materially based obligation. Yet while few would judge such
  marriages harshly, they feel free to condemn those between ageing
  billionaires and their younger new wives. Surely these too are based on
  reciprocal obligation: for having to appear on the arms and in the beds
  of their rich husbands, the women may make use of his power and money.
  
  Maybe the Billionaire parable arouses our ire because we see that both
  parties are choosing a marriage based on reciprocal obligation, rather
  than love. Those who opt for such a marriage, unlike the less well-off
  who have little choice, are seen to degrade both themselves and the
  shared value of love.
  
  Or perhaps we resent the Billionaire tale because it reminds us that,
  feminism notwithstanding, there has been little change in the social
  value men and women accord one another. Men still see women as current
  or former beauties, women still view men as walking wallets. And for
  most of us, this value system marks us as inferior goods.
  
  The Billionaire parable angers women by reminding them that their market
  value is in irreversible day-by-day decline. Men are incensed by being
  reminded that, as the real value of their pay packet is decaying, their
  primary value to women is still as providers of money and status. In a
  world where many of us will marry at least twice, reminders that our
  value as partners is ever declining may simply be unwelcome news.

  THE evidence is everywhere. On the radio, where popular new group Cake
  sing “I need your understanding, I need your love so much/you tell me
  that you love me so, you tell me that you care/but when I need you baby,
  you’re never there”, and The Whitlams croon about the aphrodisiac effect
  of loneliness.
  
  It’s on the TV where Mikey Robbins and Paul McDermott of Good News Week
  fame attract mixed audiences with their matter-of-fact progressive
  attitudes to gender relations. It’s on the silver screen, in films like
  The Brothers McMullen and Good Will Hunting. And it’s in best-selling
  non-fiction and fiction like Raimond Gaita’s Romulus, My Father and
  Elliot Perlman’s Three Dollars.
  
  A renaissance in male culture, in which male artists and public
  personalities are mapping new ways of relating to women and to one
  another, has begun. Many of these developments are nothing short of
  radical.
  
  Standard screen depictions of male friendships are characterised by
  aggressive, sometimes even violent, interaction between the male
  protagonists. If the sound of a film like White Men Can’t Jump is
  lowered, the facial expressions and body language of Billy (Woody
  Harrelson) and Sidney (Wesley Snipes) makes it impossible to tell if
  they are friends or enemies. But even without the sound, it is
  impossible to mistake the relationship in Good Will Hunting between Will
  (Matt Damon) and Chuckie (Ben Affleck) for anything other than the
  Australian Oxford’s definition of friendship: a relationship in which
  one is jointed to another in intimacy and affection.
  
  This change to the definition and description of male friendship is the
  most startling, and to my mind most moving, aspect of the male
  renaissance.
  
  In many ways, the traditional power topography of male-female intimate
  relations has given way under the pressure of women’s organised and
  individual insistence on change. These demands, and their accompanying
  validation of female emotional and sexual power, have been articulated
  and codified in alternative and mainstream female artistic output.
  
  The same, however, can not be said of the change in men’s relationships
  with one another being mapped out in the male cultural renaissance.
  Feminist analysis and interest in male-to-male relations has been scant,
  because feminism is a movement about women and because the power
  analysis central to feminist thinking provides little insight into the
  shortcomings of male-to-male relations.
  
  Instead, these changes seem both by and for men, with women either
  benignly absent or featuring only peripherally.
  
  In Romulus, My Father, Raimond Gaita walks us through his relationship
  with his father and his father’s best friend, who joined together to
  raise him when his mother became incapacitated by mental illness.
  Gaita’s style is appealingly understated as he uses the everyday
  experiences of his turbulent life to reveal how his father Romulus lived
  - and was in essence defined - by the moral codes he passed on to his
  philosopher son.
  
  In Buy Now, Pay Later (off the Whitlams’ best-selling album Eternal
  Nightcap), Tim Freedman urges his friend Charlie to abandon his heroin
  habit and return to caring about and being cared for by his friends and
  girlfriend. Everything about the song’s characteristics and performance
  - from the lyrics to the tempo of the music - seek to emphasise, rather
  than use false bravado to disguise, the pain and disillusionment
  Freedman feels as a result of his friend’s drug-enforced emotional
  absence.
  
  The central protagonists of the new male renaissance are mostly, though
  not exclusively, members of Generation X (Gaita, for instance, is a Baby
  Boomer). Gangland author Mark Davis might argue that this partially
  explains the indifference of the largely Baby Boom cultural ruling class
  to the sort of generational change seen in the renaissance.
  
  But many in Generation X also see little in the renaissance about which
  to crow. Their matter-of-fact attitude is summed up well by my
  29-year-old partner’s disinterest in the central theme of this piece:
  that the progressive approach that Generation X males take towards
  male-female/male-male relations is worthy of note. “That’s just the way
  things are now,” he says impatiently, “what’s there to talk about?”
  
  Perhaps. But the men of Generation X seem to appreciate the depth of
  revelation and intimacy possible in their relationships with women and
  other men. And, as any good behavioralist knows, if positive behavior is
  to stay positive, it needs reinforcement.
  
  But this is only true if the behavior is being performed to please
  another. And perhaps this is the nugget of the low-key way Generation X
  men regard their new relationship approach: that they are doing it for
  themselves.
  
  They have not changed to earn pats of approval from their fathers or
  mothers, previous generations of feminists, or the women they live with
  and love. Rather, they act as they do because this is the way to unlock
  the deepest and most satisfying intimacy potential of their
  relationships - be they with women or other men. And that is its own
  reward.

  First Diana, now Monica. They became superstars, but that doesn’t make
  them admirable.
  
  THE canonisation of Saint Monica has begun. Before our very eyes the
  media is transforming Lewinsky from a dumb-assed slut to an admirable
  young woman. She’s tamed her white-trash haircut and thrown away her
  baseball cap. She’s donned cheekbones and a dignified navy suit. She’s
  learnt her lesson. She’s showed him! Why, she’s turned out to be quite a
  remarkable young lady.
  
  I don’t wish to be mean when it comes to Lewinsky. There’s no doubt
  she’s been through a lot. I mean, I would rather die than have the
  idiotic things I said and did in my early 20s - sexual and otherwise -
  broadcast to TV audiences worldwide in choice snippets and available
  verbatim to every geek with a computer. And I know she’s in debt, and
  I’m truly glad to see she’s managed to impress the newspapers and
  commentators she so desperately needs to sell the book, to make the
  millions, to pay the lawyers, to clean up the mess Bill and Monica made.
  
  But I don’t like being asked to admire Lewinsky, even though being born
  and raised in America gives me an unpleasant clarity about why the
  American media and public, having spent most of last year eating her for
  breakfast, are this year happy to orchestrate her rehabilitation. It’s a
  penchant for tell-all confessions followed by true-grit struggle and
  redemption, plus a healthy dollop of guilt, that has got Americans
  working their way towards a love of Monica that rivals their love of
  Princess Di. And the parallel is not incidental.
  
  One long afternoon in front of the tube is testimony aplenty to the
  American love for public confession. Whether it be about goats and
  grandmothers, or daughters who sleep with their similarly aged
  step-fathers, there is little Americans won’t divulge for Oprah or an
  Oprah-substitute, a live audience and a camera that broadcasts to the
  global millions at home.
  
  But simply “letting it out” is no longer the name of the game. After the
  successful reactionary and society-wide assault on “victimhood” and the
  “culture of complaint”, Oprah now articulates America’s new focus on
  moving women past the “whining” stage. “Let it out and do something
  about it,” she now coaches. “Or shut up.”
  
  And Monica has done just that. She’s stopped whining, stopped shopping
  and stopped looking like she can’t stop eating. And there’s nothing
  Americans like more than a success story, although their standards for
  success remain tragically low: be thin, be rich and be famous.
  
  Now if that formula sounds depressingly like the one that endeared
  Princess Diana to the Americans, here’s another important similarity in
  both women’s self-promotion strategies. Both Monica and Di “made it” in
  that quintessentially female way - through their relationships with men.
  Relationships in which they stood by their men until they were so hurt,
  so tragically wronged, that they had to let it out. “I see myself in a
  similar situation (to Diana),” Lewinsky revealed in a recent interview.
  “I was also wronged by a man who said he loved me.”
  
  And let it out they did, in surprisingly similar ways. In “revelatory”
  interviews in which every question was known and every response and
  facial gesture scripted. Interviews in which tears and despair were
  importantly paired - not with bitterness but with a stoic determination
  to survive.
  
  OK, so that’s the name of the game, and she’s playing it. But admire
  her? Feel for her, maybe. Want it to work out for her in the end, OK.
  After all, she’s been through the spin cycle of the well-practised
  presidential bimbo-control machine and, as I’m sure Gennifer Flowers,
  Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey and Juanita Broaddrick would testify, this
  is not a particularly self-affirming experience.
  
  But if Americans feel guilty about what’s happened to Monica (and what
  hasn’t happened to Bill) as a result of their dalliance, they should
  stop looking the other way each time another woman tied up with Clinton
  reveals not just how trying he finds keeping his pecker in his pants,
  but how difficult a time he has understanding the word “no”.
  
  But spare me the spiel about her “self-awareness”, her “articulateness”,
  her “poise” and the “quick-witted” way she ducks the questions of those
  before whom she has placed herself - dollar signs registering
  Bugs-Bunny-like in both eyes.
  
  I would love a woman of my generation to be put in the media spotlight
  for all to admire. Someone whose values and behavior somehow capture the
  essence and spirit of the women of Generation X as we face the
  millennium. There are a number of high-quality candidates out there, but
  Lewinsky isn’t one.

  IN A new book, A Return to Modesty, 23-year-old American Wendy Shalit
  argues that women’s problems spring from their lack of modesty - or, to
  put it more crudely, their inability to keep their knickers above their
  knees.
  
  Weighing in on the Clinton-Lewinsky affair, Shalit concludes that the
  core social problem exposed by Lewinsky’s behavior in the White House is
  young women’s lack of sexual and moral inhibitions. I thought it was
  their seeming belief that the surest route into the Oval Office is still
  on their knees.
  
  It shouldn’t be surprising that Shalit and other twenty-something women,
  weaned on Reagan and Thatcherite notions of personal responsibility,
  look to women themselves as the source of their own misery. As the Gen X
  women in Kathy Bail’s DIY Feminism note, blaming patriarchal society for
  female problems makes a girl guilty of “self-pity and the worst kind of
  passivity”.
  
  If Bail is right, many Gen X women see the sourcing of female
  unhappiness in social causes (or the naming of the personal as the
  political) as an unacceptable mimicry of the approach of the previous
  generations (“the mothers”). In the eyes of “the daughters”, such
  identification prohibits the separation necessary for young women to
  create their own generational approach to problems and change.
  
  The advantage of the individual-responsibility approach to women’s
  problems is that in claiming our lives are the result of our “choices”,
  we emphasise female agency and control.
  
  But allocating agency and control to women’s lives when little exists
  leaves us unable to name the political difficulties that are making our
  personal lives hell. And if we cannot source a problem back to its
  origins in social beliefs and organisation, then we cannot alter the
  ideas or institutions that have caused it. We remain stuck, blaming and
  hating ourselves for problems for which we actually bear little
  responsibility.
  
  And this is only one of the problems with an analysis that places female
  sexual conduct at the heart of all that ails women. The second is the
  re-activation of the sexual double standard, a re-activation that in the
  Abbott and Costello libel case led to the awarding of one of the biggest
  defamation payouts in ACT history. A double standard that judges women’s
  behavior, and their moral virtue, differently to men’s. A
  double-standard that says that while men’s reputations are rightly based
  on moral virtues like honesty and integrity, women’s justly revolve
  around what they do or don’t do in bed: on whether they are good girls,
  or sluts.
  
  The past 30 years have provided women with greater opportunities to live
  a life as varied and full as that lived by men. To be able to be not
  only parents and partners, but employees as well. Along with this
  freedom has come sexual freedom, important less because it gives women
  greater licence in bed, but because it helped vanquish the notion that
  what women get up to in the sack matters in any assessment of their
  characters.
  
  To a large extent, however, employment opportunities for women have been
  opened up without the necessary guarantees and supports. Women have been
  allowed to work (at roughly three-quarters of the male wage) as long as
  they continued to uphold their previous responsibilities as wives and
  mothers.
  
  It’s an impossible task, but through the ’80s working women - their
  capes flying behind them - tried hard to make it work. When they were
  forced to confess defeat at the start of the ’90s, they largely blamed
  themselves (lack of organisation, stamina and honesty about the
  difficulties were common themes). But the burial of the supermum myth
  has not been accompanied by structural solutions to women’s predicament.
  To the contrary, structurally and socially, things have become more
  difficult, with childcare costs and unpredictable working hours both on
  the rise.
  
  My research on young childless women shows that working mothers are not
  the only ones feeling confused and unsupported by these changes. Gen X
  women, for whom working is an assumption not a debate, are increasingly
  worried about their capacity to make a reality all parts of their
  imagined futures as employees, partners and mothers.
  
  This, rather than how often they have sex, and with what number of
  partners, is the cause of any female malaise. For both women and men,
  sex is a small though important part of our lives: a part that has
  little to do with defining our characters or dictating our happiness.
  
  The real problem young women face is twofold. Firstly, that the lives we
  have and the lives we want contain too much responsibility and not
  enough social support. Secondly, that the analytical tools needed to
  source responsibility for both the problem and the solution have been
  thrown out, in an understandable but damaging attempt to find solutions
  unique to our generation.

  TO circumcise our sons or not? Before our first children were born, a
  Jewish friend and I argued the question. Our non-Jewish partners looked
  on, unsure what the fuss was about.
  
  While 80 per cent of Australian boys were circumcised in the 1960s, only
  one in 10 is today. The medical profession that performed most
  circumcisions and promoted the procedure as more hygienic, now advises,
  in the absence of cultural and religious reasons, against the procedure.
  While this position has a tolerant ring, a Jewish couple I know
  encountered hostility from numerous medical practitioners who refused to
  circumcise, and actively sought to discourage them going elsewhere.
  
  But subtle “bad parent” accusations from the medical establishment don’t
  worry me. What does are claims that infants subconsciously remember the
  violation of the trust they experienced when their mothers abandoned
  them to the pain of circumcision. I worry my boy may be teased by his
  mates for looking different. That he may resent the inalterable choice
  we have made about his body. A choice, say opponents of circumcision,
  that sacrifices (in the true Bibilical sense of the word) male sexual
  pleasure.
  
  Our plumber, and a policeman we know have circumcised their boys so
  they’ll “look like their Dad”. But for Jews the issue is more complex.
  The two most observed Jewish customs of even the most non-religious Jews
  are circumcision and burial in a Jewish cemetery. Belief in the
  importance of circumcision as a mark of Jewish identity, and so of
  difference, explains why some Jews find the imperative to circumcise
  even more compelling in periods - like now - when it is out of favor
  among non-Jews. Jews circumcise not because it is fashionable, the
  thinking goes, but because it is the mark of convenant between God and
  the Jewish people. Jews circumcise because it reflects what we believe
  and who we are. Jews circumcise because they are Jews.
  
  IN THE biographical film Europa Europa, Shlomo Perel feigns Aryan
  identity as he waits out the war in a school for Hitler youth. Afraid of
  being discovered, longing to fit in with the other young men, Shlomo
  ties a string around his penis in an attempt to re-grow his foreskin.
  Although his circumcision repeatedly endangers his life, the film makes
  it clear that it saves Shlomo’s soul. Unable to blend in and forget he
  is a Jew, Shlomo is forced to resist his temptation to identity with -
  and so be complicit in - the evil of the Nazis.
  
  As an ethicist and a feminist, I hate the idea of circumcision. As a
  secular Jew, I find the argument about circumcision’s symbolic value
  compelling. I like the idea that circumcision offers boys a physical
  reminder of who they are, and where they belong.
  
  Yet I am also sceptical. As a woman, I lack the “mark of the convenant”,
  yet have never felt tempted to forget or forsake my Jewish identity.
  During the Holocaust, male circumcision meant that the most
  gentile-looking women were most often sent beyond the ghetto to deliver
  messages and search for food and water. While remaining beyond the walls
  would no doubt have helped many of these women to survive, no stories
  exist of large numbers of them forsaking those awaiting their return.
  Perhaps, then, circumcision is but a physical reminder of the more
  important psychic cut that being raised Jewish makes on the soul.
  
  For me, the real dilemma comes from the strange confluence of
  circumstances that have seen me marry and bear children far from my
  native New York. Ten years in Australia have led me to believe that the
  largely secular way I took on a Jewish identity has few parallels here.
  In the suburb outside Manhattan in which I grew up, amid a Jewish
  American community that numbered millions, there were a myriad ways to
  participate and identify as a Jew. My family considered themselves
  Reform Jews - the least observant level of a three-tiered system in
  which Conservative and Orthodox are the middle and highest rungs.
  
  We rarely set foot in Temple. Yet while my parents were agnostics, they
  were unremittingly enthusiastic about being Jewish. For them that meant
  eating bagels, lox and cream cheese at our Sunday family brunches, and
  scrutinising and rejoicing in our every educational accomplishment. It
  also meant refusing my yearly entreaties to buy a Christmas tree and
  fairy lights, and feeling slightly offended on the rare instances we
  received cards wishing us a Merry Christmas, rather than the more
  neutral Holiday Greetings.
  
  When pushed, my parents thought it would be “nice” if I chose to
  circumcise the baby, but they didn’t see circumcision as critical to his
  identity. Technically they are right. Being born of a Jewish mother, not
  circumcision, makes a boy Jewish. They also knew that in the US, Britain
  and Israel, a small but vocal group of Jews are now opposing
  circumcision. A Jewish scholar recently wrote a book, endorsed by five
  liberal Jewish rabbis, arguing against the practice. My parents
  believed, in other words, that an uncircumcised boy in New York would
  still be accepted by our Jewish peers as a Jew.
  
  But in Melbourne things are somewhat different. The Jewish community is
  small and even its most liberal Reform branches would be considered
  Conservative in America. Those who in the past have raised circumcision
  as an issue for debate have not, in the main, been kindly received.
  Whether this stance is wise or foolish, it is the way things are. The
  way I grew up being Jewish means I will always be an outsider in this
  community. I can live with this - my Jewish identity is formed and is
  now self-sustaining. But I worry that by not circumcising my boys I am
  making them outsiders too. And this Jewish community is the only one
  they will ever really know.
  
  My friend is also an outsider in the local Jewish community, but while
  he agreed with many of my concerns about circumcision, and worried about
  causing his baby son pain, he never really considered not circumcising.
  Because his wife isn’t Jewish, they were ineligible for a bris, the
  ceremonial circumcision eight days after the birth. Instead, they spent
  several weeks finding a doctor who would agree to circumcise. My friend
  had to hold the baby down, while his partner waited outside, listening
  to the baby’s screams from the other side of the door.
  
  They say they have no regrets, and I believe them. They traded their
  baby’s fleeting pain for his entrance into the history and tradition of
  the Jewish people. I believe in this tradition and want to be part of
  its preservation. I hear the voices of the Orthodox, asking, “Who are
  you to pick and choose among our traditions?” But each time I tried to
  imagine the doctor or mohel - the ritual performer of the circumcision
  rite - moving towards my baby to make the cut, I baulked. Like my friend
  who knew he must circumcise, I came to know I could not. There were
  reasons for and against, but in the end it came down to the small voice
  in my head that kept saying “no”.

  All workers, not just parents and not just women, need a life.
  
  ONE of the hallmarks of the feminism of Generation X is a more peaceable
  attitude towards men. This is good, because if women are to enter the
  next stage of the revolution, we’re going to need them.
  
  Not that we know it. When women discuss the work and childbearing
  problem, they do speak of men. They note approvingly what a good father
  their partner will be, and how supportive he is of her desire to work.
  But when it comes to resolving the conflict between work and parenting,
  men exit stage left from women’s musings. Few expect men to contribute
  half of the effort necessary to get them back to work after the birth,
  and none see the child-care problem as a shared one.
  
  Women’s definition of the work and parenting conflict is how she is
  going to take responsibility for her decision to work after she has a
  baby (since it is she who is \`\`shirking’’ what society sees as her
  full-time mothering obligation). Women do not see the problem as how
  they, a couple in which both partners work, are to face the challenge to
  their existing work patterns posed by the birth of their child.
  
  Sex-role socialisation is not the only reason women tend to assume all
  the responsibility for planning and raising baby. They are also
  realists. While studies continue to report improvements over the past 10
  years in men’s assumption of child care and housework, they still do
  less of both than women, even if both are working full-time.
  
  Men also make more money than women and, if a child is to be cared for
  at home, it usually makes more sense for the low-earner to give up work.
  Child care is appallingly expensive. Only women with well-paid jobs make
  enough to cover the costs for just one child and still have anything
  left over, let alone two or three.
  
  At a barbecue last month I met a woman slowly going insane from
  providing full-time care to a demanding toddler and a four-year-old. She
  yearned to return to the part-time secretarial position she had before
  the last child was born. But with the cost of work clothes, travel and
  child care, she and her husband had concluded it just was not worth it.
  \`\`I just have to wait until they’re at school,‘’ she said, \`\`then it
  will be my turn.’’
  
  Government support, in the form of subsidised child care and
  anti-discrimination legislation, will go some way to making it
  economically rational for women to decide to return to a job they still
  have after they give birth. But only workplace reform will deliver to
  women the level playing field that will ensure their job is as
  worthwhile as it was before they became a mother.
  
  While business lauds itself for providing actual part-time work and set
  the 40-hour working week, few women really want such \`\`mummy-track‘’
  positions. Being on the mummy-track means getting less interesting work
  that, even if done well and in a timely manner, is less valued by
  colleagues and superiors. It also means copping the resentment of
  colleagues when arriving after 9am and racing out the door at 5pm.
  \`\`It’s all right for some,’’ many sneer, forgetting that the reduced
  hours mothers work means reduced take-home pay.
  
  Others on the part-time mummy-track, still laden with a full-time
  workload, return their status to full-time so at least they get paid for
  the work they do.
  
  Mothers don’t want special treatment at work, and they shouldn’t need
  it. What they need, like all other Australian workers, is better work
  conditions. All workers, not just parents, have a life and
  responsibilities outside work, and all would appreciate and benefit from
  leaving work every night at a reasonable hour.
  
  Once all workers leave early and together, working mothers benefit.
  Firstly, because it’s not only mothers going home to spend the evening
  with the kids, but fathers, too. For working women, this means two
  people, instead of one, to share child collection, shopping and other
  domestic tasks. Secondly, when hiring and firing and promotion time
  comes around, the end of the mummy track means working mothers are no
  longer disadvantaged in comparison to working fathers, the childless or
  parents with older children. In fact, a \`\`reasonable hours for all’’
  policy may assist women now parenting full-time to use their husbands
  reasonable home arrival time to support well-earned personal time, or to
  pursue paid work.
  
  And this is where men come in. Because without an en masse challenge by
  working fathers and fathers-to-be to the corporate culture that is (or
  will be) depriving them of active fatherhood, Australian workplaces have
  little reason to change. While trickles of downshifters abandoning the
  rat-race validate our belief that workplace culture is unbalancing our
  lives, high unemployment means employers can replace the drop-outs with
  fresh-faced recruits, and never question the structural nature of what
  went wrong.
  
  Men hold the vast majority of powerful positions in corporate Australia,
  and it is for them that current corporate culture is seen - and was
  designed - to cater. By joining together, perhaps in one of the newly
  forming unions for high-income earners, working fathers and
  fathers-to-be could be at the vanguard of the next revolution - a
  revolution for the benefit of themselves, working mothers, and every
  worker who has things they want to and must do after work.

  Don’t blame the movement, blame the system.
  
  SIAN Prior (on this page last month) gave us an insight into the
  stresses successful young women experience in attempting to fit
  motherhood into their high-powered lives. Prior protested against
  repeated attempts by Cathy Sherry on this page to blame feminism and
  feminists, rather than Australian workplace attitudes and practices, for
  women’s inability to \`\`have it all’’ before their biological clocks
  strike midnight.
  
  Sherry is not alone in her desire to sheet home responsibility to
  \`\`feminism’’ for women’s distress about the
  work/relationship/motherhood conflict. American feminists Sylvia Hewlett
  and Rene Denfield are just two of the women who contend that feminism
  has failed to set priorities for the needs of the vast majority of its
  constituency: educated middle-class women who assume they’ll work and
  plan to mother. The critics contend that feminism taught young women
  they’d have it all, but then got derailed into male-hating, goddess
  worship and anti-porn crusades. These distractions have led to young
  women’s disaffection from the movement, and the movement’s failure to
  procure the social policies necessary for women to pursue their
  feminist-inspired dreams.
  
  While Beatrice Faust contends that such problems, and the related
  disaffection of young women, are exclusive to the United States, young
  Australian women beg to differ. Deakin University’s Fiona Stewart found
  gen-X women exhausted by the clash between their expectations for their
  lives, and antagonistic social forces. They speak of glass ceilings and
  a pervasive sense of feeling \`\`ripped off’’ by a feminism that falsely
  suggested the world was their oyster. Such feelings contrast sharply
  with the high approval ratings that baby boomers give the women’s
  movement. These women express gratitude to feminism for having increased
  their self-regard, their independence and their opportunities for work
  and education.
  
  Who is right? Is it ridiculous, as some movement defenders claim, to
  blame a protest movement like feminism for the conditions it seeks to
  change? To claim that women’s resentment of, or lack of interest in, the
  feminist movement is simply the result (to quote Denfield) of tuning in
  to \`\`Channel Backlash‘’? Or is the feminist claim that it should be
  exempt from such criticism because of its outsider status disingenuous?
  Is it unjustified, as media commentator Catharine Lumby suggests, for
  feminists to claim they are outside \`\`the power loop’’, given the
  inroads the movement has made into government institutions, public
  policy and popular debate?
  
  Certainly it is misguided for the old order to reply to younger women’s
  feelings of being ripped off by feminism with backlash-type arguments.
  Feelings are feelings, resistant by nature to logical counters. If
  younger women feel angry or indifferent about feminism’s past promises
  or current direction, then that is a problem for the long-term viability
  of the movement. Consequently, those feelings must be taken seriously
  and addressed, pronto.
  
  While taking younger women’s views seriously does not mean treating
  everything we say as gospel, it does mean an end to explaining away our
  concerns by using ideas such as \`\`false consciousness‘’ and
  \`\`patriarchal brainwashing’’. Such explanations imply we lack
  maturity, media savvy and moral agency, and thoroughly piss us off. In
  fact, objections to the old order’s assumptions about women’s lack of
  moral agency - not its social, rather than individualistic, explanations
  of female oppression - are behind the derogatory tagging of the old
  order as \`\`victim’’ feminists.
  
  When younger women say that the most important goal of the feminist
  movement is to help women balance work and family, the old order must
  listen. But who’s to say it isn’t or hasn’t?
  
  However much political, personal and media power and influence the
  feminist movement has, few believe we live in a feminist world: a world
  designed around and catering to women’s needs and priorities. In
  addition to undermining the basic work protections upon which women
  rely, the Howard Government has had little time for the grass-roots
  feminist movement or institutional feminist power bases, many of which
  have been dismantled since the Liberals came to power. This means that
  even if resolving the work/motherhood conflict had been the number one
  priority of the old order, working mothers are unlikely to have been
  much better off than they are today.
  
  While there are legitimate points of difference between older and
  younger feminists, it is the Government and the workplace that have
  really betrayed working mothers and those aspiring to motherhood. And
  while new-order feminists may be right to grouse about the priority
  grass-roots feminist organisations and femocrats have given to the
  work/family conflict, perhaps younger women have also let down the
  women’s movement. Grass-roots feminist organisations struggle to recruit
  younger members, perhaps because of their failure to set priorities for
  issues that concern younger women, but also because many are busy with
  their families, or too busy \`\`doing it themselves’’.
  
  It is more than understandable that younger women are angry. We want the
  struggle for our rights, and the things we need to access them, to be
  over. And we thought it was. But we must ensure that we direct our anger
  appropriately. Directing it to reshape grass-roots and institutional
  feminist priorities to suit our goals is appropriate, but pretending
  that feminist social analysis, or a movement for and about women is no
  longer relevant to younger women’s realities, is not.
  
  We are right to feel ripped off, but mistaken to continue that long
  female tradition of turning our anger in on ourselves. We’ve got much
  bigger fish to fry.

  Just like John Howard, Martin Ferguson wants to take us back to the
  future.
  
  MARTIN Ferguson, the federal Labor frontbencher and former ACTU head,
  argues that to win power, the ALP must re-embrace its core working-class
  constituency: the shrinking pool of blue-collar workers and the great
  majority of Australians employed in routine jobs.
  
  Most working women are employed in such routine jobs, but Ferguson (who
  outlined his case on this page on 14 June) restricts his explicit
  discussion of women to those who \`\`choose not to enter the paid
  workforce during important parts of their lives’’. Like the battlers,
  Ferguson contends, these women have been forgotten by Labor.
  
  Ferguson’s view of Labor’s future embraces the coalition’s successful
  deployment of US-style \`\`wedge’’ politics. His recipe for political
  success intimates that Labor ought to pursue coalition-established
  electoral divisions between battlers and special-interest groups,
  between forgotten mothers at home and middle-class tertiary-educated
  femocrats.
  
  Nice world view - pity about the facts. The world I live in is one in
  which distinctions between blue-collar and tertiary-educated job-seekers
  and keepers are fast disappearing. Not only is a university education no
  longer a ticket to a good job, it’s no guarantee of any job. Graduates
  cobble together several McJobs, try their luck overseas, or join their
  \`\`social inferiors’’ in the dole queue.
  
  Among those with jobs, the distinctions between blue-collar and
  \`\`privileged‘’ are even more blurred. Both groups complain of having
  to work harder than they used to, with less job security and fewer
  benefits. Both lack adequate planning advice and savings schemes for
  retirement, predictable working hours, a cap on the number of hours
  worked, compensation for overtime, adequate staffing levels to do the
  job properly, paid maternity/paternity and parental leave, and on-site
  child care - to name a few. If Ferguson had been paying attention, he
  might have noticed that some higher-paid workers are seeking to redress
  their concerns in a manner similar to their \`\`blue-collar’’
  counterparts: by unionising.
  
  In Ferguson-land, forgotten working-class women \`\`choose‘’ to remain
  outside the workforce. They feel unrepresented by \`\`femocrats’’
  interested in equality of opportunity, sex discrimination legislation,
  child care and other issues of sole concern to the educated middle
  class.
  
  Again, reality rudely intrudes into this antiquated
  when-men-were-men-and-sheep-were-nervous view of Australia. More than
  half the women in the labor force are \`\`working class’’ (employed as
  clerks, saleswomen or personal service providers), and many are mothers.
  Forty-eight per cent of women with children under five have a job, or
  want one. Once their children reach school age, 60per cent of mothers
  are in the workforce. They, like all women, want high-quality and
  affordable care for their children, a fair day’s wages and a safe
  working environment.
  
  In future the proportion of working mothers in all income levels is
  likely to skyrocket. A recent survey of 39,000 young Australian women
  found those from lower-income backgrounds aspire - to almost the same
  extent as those from higher-income backgrounds - to professional,
  para-professional or managerial positions. Given that longitudinal
  studies consistently suggest that young people’s estimation of their
  future paths are almost always on the mark, these figures signal a big
  shift in future working patterns of lower-income women.
  
  As lower-income women begin fulfilling their aspirations for more
  professional work, the number of babies they have is also likely to
  decline. This will lead to a contraction in Ferguson’s forgotten
  heartland of women outside the labor force, given that women without
  children will have fewer reasons to stay at home.
  
  A recent marketing survey of more than 1200 Australian mothers found
  that while women with good employment prospects were happy staying at
  home, those who felt their chance for paid work was poor were
  dissatisfied with life as a full-time mum. This latter group experienced
  motherhood as a sacrifice, and their sense of powerlessness makes them
  soft targets for the \`\`good mummy/bad mummy’’ wedge-style advertising
  and politics so successfully exploited by the coalition at the last
  election and now enshrined in the tax package.
  
  Globalisation has not only made the needs and aspirations of countries
  more similar, but has homogenised the needs and aspirations of an
  increasingly global citizenry. Such similarities will increasingly cut
  across old distinctions between classes and between women.
  
  Labor doesn’t need its own version of John Howard: a man so enthralled
  by the conceptual categories and values of yesteryear that he is unable
  to see today’s Australia or fathom the pathway to tomorrow. Labor needs
  a politician brave and aware enough to see the present, and bold and
  clever enough to use this understanding to shape the future.
  
  Martin Ferguson is clearly not their man.

  Reproductive technology will never provide the answer to inequality.
  
  QUESTION: What do frozen eggs and ovaries, donor eggs, and hormone
  replacement therapy have in common?
  
  Answer: They have all helped women overcome age-related infertility or
  “beat” their biological clocks - or may be used to do so in the future.
  
  Julian Savulescu, the director of the Murdoch Institute’s ethics unit,
  contends that despite the risks to women of the drugs used in many
  infertility treatments, fertile women have a right of access to
  reproductive advances such as egg freezing. In giving women the same
  choices as men - to be educated, to work and to have children at the
  time of their choosing - Savulescu argues that egg freezing is
  potentially the most liberating reproductive advance since the
  introduction of the contraceptive pill.
  
  Jennifer Parks, in the prestigious feminist journal Hypatia, contends
  that infertility treatments that enable older and even post-menopausal
  women to have children may be the only way for women to overcome the
  social inequities that force women - but not men - to “choose” between
  career and motherhood.
  
  In Victoria, only infertile couples are allowed access to infertility
  treatments such as IVF. However, the use by fertile women of less
  ethically contentious procedures such as egg and ovary freezing, is not
  technically prohibited. More importantly, both Melbourne IVF and the
  Reproductive Biology Unit at the Royal Women’s are willing to speak to
  any woman who wishes to bank her eggs for future use.
  
  Monash IVF’s medical director, Gab Kovacs, has no personal objections to
  fertile women having access to such technologies to preserve their
  fertility - as long as they are aware of the experimental nature of the
  technology, and the associated health risks.
  
  Both Monash and Melbourne IVF assist women approaching or beyond
  menopause to become mothers using donor eggs and HRT. Melbourne IVF
  routinely treats women up to the age of 48, while Monash is unconcerned
  about age until a woman turns 45.
  
  But while Melbourne IVF’s clinical chairman, John McBain, seeks to
  discourage women suffering empty-nest syndrome from using the technology
  in the hope of having another baby, he is sympathetic to women whose
  efforts to maintain or advance in their job prohibited them from
  partnering and/or procreating in their more fertile years. And McBain
  isn’t alone in his sympathetic desire to help post-menopausal women
  attain motherhood. Last year, Adelaide’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital helped
  a 53-year-old woman give birth to triplets.
  
  It is not hard to see why some ethicists, infertility treatment experts
  and women see infertility treatment as their best hope of obtaining the
  same educational, employment and parenting opportunities as have long
  been enjoyed by men. To access them, a woman doesn’t need to change the
  world, she just needs money. For some women, such treatments may be seen
  as a way to quietly bypass a system that forces them to confront their
  most demanding career hurdles at the same times as they confront their
  reproductive shelf-life.
  
  But, unfortunately, there are a number of problems with such individual
  attempts to beat the system. The most important one, according to McBain
  and Kovacs, is the experimental nature of interventions such as egg and
  ovary freezing. Egg freezing has an extremely low success rate. McBain
  worries that women will squander their natural fertility because media
  reports about new reproductive technologies give them a false sense of
  security about their prospects of using such technology to achieve a
  mature-age pregnancy in the future.
  
  In addition, infertility treatment is time-consuming, expensive and
  invasive - and so may pose risks to women’s health. While a large
  longitudinal study conducted by the Centre for the Study of Mothers’ and
  Children’s Health at La Trobe University suggests there is no higher
  incidence of cancer among women in the short and medium term, we cannot
  yet know whether such promising findings will continue indefinitely.
  
  Fertility experts agree that the best strategy for women who want
  children is to attempt pregnancy before or around the age of 30. As a
  society, we can approach such well-meaning advice in two ways: we can
  ignore it, and enable women with the financial means to attempt their
  own private solutions to age-related childlessness by using these
  treatments; or we can restructure the way that we work.
  
  As numerous recent studies of the Australian workplace have concluded,
  corporate values continue to suppose that employees are free from family
  and other non-workplace commitments.
  
  Moreover, education patterns ensure that both women and men are in their
  peak childbearing years at precisely the same time as they are under
  most pressure to prove themselves and to advance at work.
  
  Changes to the way we work and the creation of pro-family social
  policies that support all families with children (not just those in
  which the woman doesn’t work) are two critical steps to ensuring women
  are truly free to choose when and whether they will have children.

  Taking a tiny risk can serve overall community interests.
  
  THE horror of the case in which a Melbourne girl was infected with the
  HIV virus through an anonymous blood donation, graphically demonstrates
  the clash between the best interests of the public and the best
  interests of a particular individual - in this case, a child.
  
  By definition, it is the obligation of public health officials to
  recommend that the community adopt behavior that is in the best
  interests of the public overall. Public health officials cannot, and
  should not, make behavioral recommendations based on risk assessments
  for particular individuals.
  
  When the Red Cross rejected the attempts of the girl’s father and mother
  to donate blood for her operation, they did so in line with studies
  demonstrating that overall, blood recipients are more likely to avoid
  HIV if transfused with anonymous, rather than \`\`directed’’, donations.
  
  But while the Red Cross cannot make individual risk assessments for each
  patient needing blood, parents can make such assessments for their
  child.
  
  In the Melbourne case, the parents did just that. Satisfied that they
  had not engaged in any high-risk behavior in the 22-day period in which
  HIV infection cannot be detected, these parents sought to lower the odds
  of HIV infection for their daughter - from infinitesimal to none.
  
  Behind all public health risk management strategies around HIV/AIDS, is
  the promulgation of distrust of one’s sexual partners, lovers and
  spouses. No matter what the status or longevity of a relationship,
  people are advised to wear a condom \`\`every time’’ in order to avoid
  infection. Sharing needles is also a no-no, no matter how vehemently a
  fellow user asserts their HIV-negative status.
  
  Such promotions emphasise the impossibility of a person knowing his or
  her HIV status, or the status of those with whom she has sex or injects
  drugs, not the purposeful duplicity of those claiming to be virus-free.
  But while a \`\`trust no one’’ stance may be appropriate among strangers
  or acquaintances, when applied to intimate relationships such as those
  between spouses, it has the hard and unpleasant edge of an X-file.
  
  I have no reason to doubt Red Cross claims that overall, everyone would
  be better off if they gave and accepted anonymous, rather than directed,
  donations. When his niece is faced with life-threatening surgery is not
  the time Uncle Joe - the only compatible donor - is likely to reveal he
  had sex with other men, is an intravenous drug-user, or is involved in
  other high-risk behaviors.
  
  But if it was my child who needed blood, I feel confident I could trust
  myself, my husband or numerous other family members who might be
  compatible donors to be straight about their suitability to donate. In
  bypassing an anonymous donation in favor of a directed one, I would be
  acting in accordance with a personalised risk assessment strategy that -
  as a parent - I would feel duty-bound to make.
  
  But while I would not be dissuaded from this position by public health
  assertions that there is no difference between what is in the best
  interests of my child and of the larger community, I might be influenced
  by another public interest-type argument. As an ethicist, I would find
  it difficult to resist appeals to my sense of duty to act - as an
  individual - as I know others must act if we are all to achieve the best
  community health outcomes.
  
  As a parent, I seek to install such a sense of community obligation in
  my own children. Recently, my little one came home with a tiny animal
  figurine from the child-care farm set. He knew it was unlikely to be
  missed, and wanted to keep it at home. \`\`What if every child took a
  figurine home?‘’ I asked, putting it near the front door to be returned
  the following day. \`\`Eventually there’d be no farm animals for anyone
  to play with.’’
  
  Should the option of giving a directed donation become available in
  Victoria, undermining the veracity of the personal risk assessment
  strategy I have made for my child, would not convince me to bypass this
  option. But appealing to my sense of community obligation might persuade
  me, and other thinking people engaged in low-risk behaviors, to put
  those they love at a tiny, tiny risk in order to model behavior that
  best serves the overall interest of our community.

  Court and legislative battles have embroiled this nation in an uneasy
  search for the definitive answer to the vexing question: Who are dads
  anyway? The deliverers of DNA or the conveyers of care and concern? And
  if the answer is the latter, can the law insist each child have one?
  
  The Women’s Electoral Lobby here recently made history when it became
  the first women’s organization ever to be granted leave by the nation’s
  High Court (the Australian equivalent of the U.S. Supreme Court) to
  intervene on behalf of women. The group will be arguing against no less
  an adversary than the Catholic Church in a case that will decide whether
  the nation’s single women will have the option of becoming mothers
  through modern technology.
  
  The case is set to continue on Friday, with the Judge insisting it be
  resolved no later than September 2001.
  
  The Victorian federal court had previously ruled in what is called the
  McBain decision that the state’s denial of fertility treatments, such as
  in vitro fertilization and donor sperm, to single women on the grounds
  of their martial status violated Australia’s own Sex Discrimination Act,
  as well as international agreements to which Australia is a signatory.
  
  The Catholic Church is arguing the decision should be overturned and the
  women’s lobby is urging the court to uphold the state’s ruling.
  
  Law May Pass in Parliament to Overrule High Court
  
  Hot on the heels of the state court’s McBain ruling, the lower house of
  the Australian parliament passed a bill attempting to undo it by
  authorizing the Australian states to discriminate against single women
  by denying them access to donor sperm.
  
  While two of the country’s three major parties, Labor and the Democrats,
  oppose the bill, the decision by two Labor senators to abstain means it
  may still become law. The Liberal government continues to support it on
  the grounds that children have a right to a “mother and a father by
  being conceived into a marriage or de facto relationship involving a man
  and a woman.”
  
  But are the Catholic bishops and the Australian government really
  worried about the rights of children, or those of fathers?
  
  It may surprise people to know that the law has long held marriage to be
  the true test of fatherhood. Paternal rights are accorded to the
  mother’s husband, regardless of whether her child is his biological
  progeny, although society has long attempted to ensure the legal father
  is also the biological father by socially and legally discriminating
  against “illegitimate” children and “unmarried” mothers.
  
  In the last few decades, declining rates of marriage and rising numbers
  of divorces and extramarital births have exerted pressure on
  marriage-based definitions of fatherhood. This is evidenced by the
  increasing willingness of governments to use DNA tests to establish a
  man’s biological paternity and then use this fact to compel him to
  financially support “his” children.
  
  In 1970s, Laws Said Mother’s Husband Was Father—Regardless
  
  However, when widespread use of donor insemination began in the 1970s,
  both federal and state governments in Australia and in other nations
  moved quickly to pass legislation that ensured the mother’s
  husband~~~~not the sperm donor~~~~was the legal father of the children.
  Nevertheless, while governments allowed married and later de facto
  couples to use donor sperm to form families, they repeatedly denied
  lesbians and single women similar access.
  
  The reasons are not hard to fathom. According to marriage-based
  definitions of fatherhood, children born from donor sperm to single
  women and lesbians are legally fatherless. And while the current
  Australian government has no qualms about men being viewed as optional
  when it comes to raising children~~~~its press releases repeatedly
  praise the “excellent” job done by sole parents~~~~its anxieties about
  legally excluding men from the process of forming families are palpable.
  
  How do men want fatherhood defined? Some men seem eager to endorse
  biological definitions of paternity. A U.S. man is currently fighting in
  the courts for relief from child support payments to children he
  recently discovered are not his biological progeny, although he has been
  their social father from birth and continued to fill this role after his
  marriage broke up.
  
  One explanation for declining numbers of men willing to donate sperm is
  the possibility that younger men believe that siring a child makes a man
  a father, regardless of his relationship to the child’s mother.
  
  But what about the children men help conceive, children they don’t even
  know about? Or the fact that, without testing, men cannot be sure the
  children they love and raise are biologically “theirs”? The fact that
  biological and social fatherhood can be separated means biological
  paternity, on its own, will continue to be an inadequate base on which
  to ground men’s rights to and responsibilities for children and their
  role in the family.
  
  Efforts to Assert Primacy of Marriage Likely to Fail
  
  Returning to marriage-based definitions of paternity is similarly
  pointless. The pathetic attempts by the Australian government and
  “fatherhood” advocates in the United States to reassert the primacy of
  institutions like marriage~~~~and with them marriage-based definitions
  of fatherhood~~~~are doomed to failure. The economic factors that have
  historically forced women to become and remain married cannot~~~~and
  should not~~~~be reinstated in the 21st century.
  
  The assumption made by those trying to drag us backward are that men are
  willing and eager to marry, have children and be responsible husbands
  and fathers, but women are rejecting men in droves in their eagerness to
  remain single and mother alone.
  
  Fish may not need bicycles, but anyone who thinks most women don’t want
  to live and raise children with men is sorely mistaken. The Women’s
  Health Study of 39,000 Australian women shows a staggering 96 percent of
  young women aspire to be in a de facto or married partnership, and 92
  percent want to be mothers by the time they are 35.
  
  This suggests that for the vast majority of single women, to have a
  child using donor sperm is a decision of last resort. As one 37-year-old
  woman in a recent study put it: “Of course, the idea would have been to
  have met the man of my dreams and fallen in love and have it all happen
  the usual way. … When I was on the (donor insemination) program (I
  thought), ‘What a shame I’m having to do it this way.’ But it’s the only
  avenue I have to have a child at this point in time.”
  
  The genie of fatherhood let loose by declining rates of marriage, rising
  numbers of divorces, extramarital births and the radical potential of
  donor insemination won’t go back into the bottle. We need to search for
  new, flexible definitions of fatherhood suited to the future, not the
  past. The best place to start is by asking questions about what men and
  women want~~~~from one another and when it comes to children~~~~and why
  they are having so much trouble finding it together.

  The issue: Will making women equal change anything?
  
  YES - Frank Donovan, Clinical Social Worker

  Dear Leslie
  
  Our aggressive, competitive marketplace is a reflection of men’s power
  and control, according to the women who want to break it down. How
  serious are they when, far from challenging the system, women are
  clambering to join it in their droves? And what will leading women do
  about opportunity advertising and sex-role stereotyping?
  
  Toyworld’s brochure arrived in the junk mail yesterday: the boys wentto
  war with lasers, power figures,attack cycles, mutant marauders and
  muscle-bound soldiers complete with armor and weaponry. The girls were
  all prams, babies in bassinets, shopping trollies, dolls and a fantastic
  combination oven/cook-top/kitchen assembly complete with smiling girl
  cook.
  
  Given the slaughter in East Timor, the brochure’s gender division of
  military versus mothering was poorly timed, or was it? The marketing
  gurus say that opportunity advertising and sex-role stereotyping
  actually work. Most television advertising and programming confirm it.
  
  Yes, the male aggressive marketplace of dog-eat-dog thrives in business
  as in politics and sport; supported by more women than ever.
  
  So, is it men’s aggression that has to change or just men?
  
  Or should we just keep developing technology that does men out of jobs
  and gets women into them?
  
  Confused, Frank
  
  Dear Frank
  
  There’s no doubt women are eager to participate in the public world of
  work. They need financial independence and want their share of public
  power.
  
  Globalisation creates the insecurity that fuels productivity and demand.
  Will I land a job? Will I be able to do all I must to keep it and still
  find time to marry and have a family? These are the questions that
  preoccupy so many young people, male and female.
  
  Perhaps it seems disingenuous for author Susan Faludi to call off the
  gender wars when men started fighting back. The fuel for change is
  palpable male distress and younger people’s search for non-gendered
  analysis and solutions.
  
  Male aggression is real, and it is not acceptable. It does and should
  matter that women are heavily outnumbered in Australia’s boardrooms and
  parliaments. But acknowledging how the world has come to feel so
  oppressive to all of us is going to require a more sophisticated
  understanding of power and oppression than \`\`Women have it bad, so men
  as a gender must be responsible and have it better’’.
  
  Leslie
  
  Dear Leslie
  
  So, if \`\`the fuel for change is (partly) palpable male distress‘’,
  does that mean there might be gain from men’s pain? Well, that might
  make it all worthwhile after all. And if \`\`younger people’s search
  fornon-gendered analysis and solutions’’ means understanding how we got
  into this mess, and some non-aggressive ways out of it, a lot of us men
  might just be in that.
  
  I especially like the bit about how we all need a more sophisticated
  understanding of power relations than the old \`\`Women have it bad, so
  men must have it better’’ argument. That will go down with some guys who
  aren’t feeling too flush about things. As for the gender wars, I think
  some of us men might still be struggling with the realisation that our
  old weapons (power, influence, money and control) might be emotional
  boomerangs. To put that another way, how much pain are we willing to
  endure to maintain our fragile hold on power?
  
  My original question still stands, though: \`\`When there are equal
  numbers in the boardrooms, will women do it differently or will
  oppression and aggression still feel the same?’’
  
  Encouraged, Frank
  
  Dear Frank
  
  That is a hard question. Joan (Kirner) and Moira (Rayner) think so, but
  there really is no hard evidence. So far, it looks as if putting a few
  or some women into the power hierarchy as it stands doesn’t change
  things.
  
  I suspect that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely -
  no exceptions made. Some studies suggest \`\`female’’ characteristics
  like intuition, good listening skills and non-aggression can be found
  among all oppressed minorities; essential skills for managing those in
  power.
  
  Women’s long association with raising children may also explain their
  nurturing skills. But, as men increase their active participation in
  fathering their children, men’s skills in these areas will also
  increase.The values inherent in raising children - selflessness,
  sacrifice, interdependence - stand in stark contrast to those of the
  competitive market.
  
  The inculcation of these values in both men and women is an important
  step in preparing men and women to face the real challenge of the next
  century: the destruction of individualist \`\`economically rationalist’’
  values, policies and practices.
  
  Here’s my question: do men do, should men do, fatherhood differently to
  the way women do motherhood?
  
  Leslie
  
  Dear Leslie
  
  Yes, I think so. Men have to model different ways of being. Men have to
  model ways of being whole (emotionally and rationally) that many of us
  still have not come to terms with yet - especially when it comes to our
  sons.
  
  I have never met Joan, though Moira might remember me from WA. But I
  have seen those characteristics of intuition, good listening skills and
  non-aggression among Aboriginal men and women in the north-west and
  Central Desert regions. Seemed to work for them, sort of … eventually.
  
  And, in the light of your reminder about inherent child-raising values,
  I guess that takes us to the heart of the challenge. On Friday, I heard
  Sister Anne Forbes interviewed on ABC’s 7.30 Report after her evacuation
  from Dili. She said: \`\`I just pray we can learn to rule the world with
  our hearts instead of our heads.’’ By the time Sunday Age readers see
  our debate, the people she spent the last days with may well be dead.
  
  I guess our challenge is how to reconnect \`\`the heart’’ with the head
  on equal terms. Could men and women join forces, maybe?
  
  Cautiously, Frank
  
  Dear Frank
  
  I’m still not sure what different ways of being you would like to see
  men model for their sons, although my own two boys leave me in no doubt
  that it is to their fathers that boys look for a role model. Are you
  saying that women are naturally society’s \`\`hearts‘’ and men its
  \`\`heads’’? In Victoria, middle-aged women are less supportive of the
  Premier, Jeff Kennett, than middle-aged men, but I don’t think
  femaleness accounts for this. Rather, it is that mothers are usually
  more involved in their children’s lives than fathers, and so notice and
  care more when hospitals and schools deteriorate.
  
  I agree that society needs to cultivate and value virtues associated
  with women such as nurture and compassion. But these value aren’t really
  female any more than their opposites are intrinsically male. We value
  what we know, and what we know comes from our experience. As men and
  women have more of the same experiences in the paid workforce and at
  home, they will come to know and value more of the same things.
  
  These shared experiences, knowledges and values are the basis of the
  joint assault force you propose. To achieve it, we must continue to work
  towards a society in which women and men work as equals and in equal
  proportions outside and inside the home. Equality is the basis of the
  human liberation both men and women seek, and from which both men and
  women will benefit. Ironically, it is only when women and men achieve
  social equality that we will finally know whether and what sorts of
  natural differences exist between the sexes.

  Victoria’s intellectuals are blind to the Premier’s popular appeal.
  Here’s why.
  
  ROBERT Manne on this page on Monday (\`\`The state of silence‘’)
  bemoaned the apathy of Victorians towards Jeff Kennett’s undercutting of
  democracy. Such indifference, argued Manne, means Victorians must
  ultimately bear responsibility for anti-democratic outcomes such as the
  silencing of public servants, the nobbling of the director of public
  prosecutions and the auditor-general, and the demonising of
  \`\`quality’’ media such as the ABC and The Age.
  
  Manne’s argument exemplifies the frustration of academic and
  journalistic intellectual elites - aka the chattering classes - at our
  inability to use our knowledge and reason to convince \`\`ordinary’’
  Victorians to punish the Liberals at the ballot box tomorrow.
  
  Having grown up in Reagan’s America, this frustration has a familiar
  feel for me. Like Victorian intellectuals today, American intellectuals
  back then were aghast at the anti-democratic policies and practices of
  the Reagan administration. And, like their Victorian counterparts now,
  American intellectuals then sought to persuade their countrymen that
  Reagan’s contempt for democracy merited his removal from office.
  
  But more importantly, America’s chattering classes refused either to
  acknowledge or to analyse - in public at least - the indifference of
  most Americans to their knowledgeable and well-reasoned rejections of
  Reagan’s demagogic and populist leadership. Indeed, the most profound
  analyses of Reagan’s enduring popularity were that he was made of teflon
  and that the average person was incapable of understanding the
  importance of the separation of powers to American democracy.
  
  Like America’s elite in the 1980s, Victoria’s intelligentsia in the
  1990s have either ignored their inability to stop the rising tide of
  Jeff-worship, or proffered condescending explanations of the public’s
  failure to heed their warnings.
  
  With so much ink having been used on the subject of why Victorians
  should vote against Kennett, it may be appropriate to dedicate some
  space to pondering the indifference of the vast majority of Victorians
  to this message.
  
  In my view, this ineffectiveness stems from the inability of Victorian
  intellectuals to recognise and acknowledge that we - unlike most
  Victorians - are stakeholders in the processes essential to democracy.
  Intellectuals assume that public policy decisions are, and ought to be,
  knowledge-based, and that we will be the source of much of that
  knowledge.
  
  We believe that democratic participation gives power to \`\`the people‘’
  to shape and share in the exercise of power. Most importantly, we
  include ourselves among \`\`the people’’ who not only have a
  responsibility to participate, but whose participation is valued, and
  will make a difference to the way things turn out.
  
  Many Victorians lack the sense of enfranchisement and empowerment that
  we intellectuals presume. They don’t expect to participate in decisions
  that affect them, nor necessarily see the value in doing so. They would
  like a fair go, but don’t necessarily expect they will get one.
  
  It may be that our assumptions about the nature of power and our
  relation to it are learnt early. When I am treated unjustly, I rant
  about ringing the ombudsman, or bang out indignant letters of complaint
  to my local member. My husband’s upbringing was less privileged than
  mine. He watches these energetic bouts with a wry smile and asks,
  \`\`Why don’t you save yourself the trouble and just bend over and take
  it?’’
  
  I see my efforts as meaningful and necessary gyrations in the search for
  a justice I deserve and that can be achieved. He sees them as silly
  ram-like batterings at a system that owes me nothing, and will see me
  where it wants me in the end. For him, the only realistic approach to
  power is to placate its hunger, and by so doing, avoid the worst of its
  wrath.
  
  This attitude to power explains the Victorian public’s love affair with
  our despotic Premier, and their antagonism to the nation’s intellectual
  elites.
  
  In the eyes of \`\`ordinary’’ Victorians, Kennett’s more realistic
  understanding of the realities of power puts them on an equal footing
  with intellectual elites. The Premier’s intuitive - rather than
  knowledge-driven - style of decision-making strips the intelligentsia of
  their privileged access to the Kingdom’s decision-makers. His disdain
  for the dogged pursuit of power and influence by special interestgroups
  sees him cut through the red tape of the process-lovers, to get on with
  the business of governing for the majority.
  
  Kennett has power and he is on the side of \`\`ordinary‘’ Victorians.
  For many Victorians, cultivating the favor of powerful friends is the
  best - indeed the only - way to avoid \`\`bending over’’.
  
  Like the Premier, many Victorians see the pursuit by media organisations
  such as the ABC and The Age of honest and accountable government, as
  stupid and irrelevant. Far from seeing their interests served by
  highbrow reporters on the trail of the truth, many Victorians seem to
  concur with Kennett’s assessment of such scrutiny as the nitpicking
  obsession of pedants with little grasp of the concerns of \`\`ordinary’’
  Victorians.
  
  If we are to fathom why the majority tomorrow will fail to heed our
  calls to protest against the upending of democracy in Victoria, we
  intellectuals need to take a hard look at ourselves. We must acknowledge
  how our alignment with power shapes our assumptions about, and valuing
  of, democracy, and how those with a different understanding of how power
  operates, and a less robust sense of personal entitlement, have come to
  see us - not Kennett - as the enemy.

  IVF advances may make the working lives of women harder, not easier.
  
  EVERY woman knows that children scuttle careers. It starts with
  pregnancy and the salary rise and promotions that never come. Then on to
  maternity leave, rarely paid, usually begrudged; that is, if there are
  no plots to restructure your job out of existence in your absence. The
  unreliability of nannies (yours had to be the only one who didn’t have
  chicken pox as a child) and the restricted hours of centre-based care
  make you inflexible enough to be passed over for interesting and/or
  career-building assignments due to a lack of \`\`seriousness‘’ and
  \`\`commitment’’.
  
  But wait. Can it be that science has contrived to rid women of the
  insistent and inflexible demands of their biological clocks? Hang on to
  your ovarian tissue, girls, because now, at the IVF clinic nearest you,
  it’s tissue-banking time.
  
  Just pop into your nearest IVF clinic, bank your twentysomething ovarian
  tissue - brim full with fresh young eggs - and get back to work
  confident that your fertility is just a regraft away. Now you too can
  work like the boys. Into the night. Weekends. Get flown overseas with
  just a moment’s notice. And with no interruptions for childbearing and
  rearing, and no children to temper your zealous devotion to the job,
  there’s nothing to stop you maintaining the pace for years.
  
  What did you say? The freezing and regrafting procedure isn’t that easy?
  Lots of eggs are lost in the removal, freezing, thawing and grafting
  procedures? Nasty adhesions around the ovaries may prevent natural
  conception even if the re-grafted tissue works perfectly?
  
  And what’s this about the unknown long-term health risks of the
  super-ovulation and hormonal stimulation - and the added time it takes
  to actually get a bub in the hand - should an IVF conception eventually
  be required? And then problems with mature-age motherhood? Not as easy
  to gestate the little mites when older what with the gestational
  diabetes and blood pressure problems that often dog older-age
  pregnancies. Not to mention the sheer exhaustion experienced by older
  mothers carting the little ones about, and getting up several times in
  the night to feed them.
  
  Of course, infertility specialists are likely to overcome some, if not
  all, of these glitches by the time women now in their 20s are ready to
  re-embrace their fertility. Ways around operative and re-operative
  adhesions, extensions to the shelf life of grafts in older women, and
  even counters to the age-related pregnancy problems and exhaustion
  experienced by older mothers are all future possibilities.
  
  For women, the real problems with tissue banking may be social, not
  medical. Problems closely associated with the pervasive assumption that
  such technologies always give women greater choice and freedom, with
  those who don’t want to participate free to opt out. In fact, while such
  technologies expand some women’s choices, they may severely restrict the
  freedoms of others.
  
  This phenomenon is not new. Writing about his experience in an IVF
  program, academic Paul Lauritzen describes the mere availability of
  reproductive technologies as tyrannical and coercive. The existence of
  multiple treatment options for his retrograde ejaculation turned his
  infertility from a fact of life for which he was blameless to a choice
  to be childless for which he was responsible.
  
  Frozen ovarian tissue grafts will expand some women’s reproductive
  freedom, but at the cost of contracting the freedom of other women to
  choose. Women who truly want to go full bore at work until they hit
  menopause, then have children later in life, now have that option. But
  women who prefer to avoid the invasiveness and uncertainty connected
  with this new medical procedure, not to mention physical and social
  stresses associated with older motherhood, may be out of luck.
  
  Stripped of their reproductive inevitabilities, women who leave the
  workforce to have kids at what their bosses deem inopportune times will
  be seen to have chosen such timing, and consequently be held responsible
  for any resulting inconveniences to the company and co-workers.
  
  Women who \`\`choose’’ to have children while still young may be held
  solely and fully responsible for any downslide in their work prospects
  during pregnancy and when they return from maternity leave. After all,
  they could have chosen to have children at the endpoint, rather than the
  highpoint, of their careers.
  
  Maternity leave, too, may become a thing of the past. Women who choose
  to have children while still in the workforce, the argument might run,
  must take full responsibility for the career and financial costs
  associated with this choice.
  
  So young lady, get ye to a tissue bank. Or perhaps your union, lawyer’s
  office or nearest women’s group. Because, if women ever had the freedom,
  however vague and unvoiced, to conceive children unassisted and when
  they were young, they may be about to lose it.
  
  In the future, all women may need an as-yet-unwritten clause in their
  awards or individual employment contracts - a clause that gives them the
  right to have children naturally, and at the time of their choosing,
  despite the scientific possibility to do otherwise.

  Knowing the identity of their biological parents gives children a sense
  of who they are.
  
  IS IT right for doctors to create embryos from donor eggs and sperm for
  random donation to infertile couples? Should couples with \`\`spare‘’
  embryos left over from successful IVF treatment \`\`donate’’ them to
  couples still trying for a baby?
  
  Arguments against such practices are usually grounded in conservative,
  often religious ideas about how babies ought to be made: by married
  couples engaging in \`\`natural’’ acts of intercourse that may - God
  willing - result in conception.
  
  For religious conservatives, the problem with embryo adoption is part
  and parcel of the problem with pre-marital sex, contraception, and
  infertility treatments such as IVF: the division of sex, marriage and
  procreation into separable and interchangeable parts.
  
  But conservative ideas about family formation and the role of the
  Almighty in human generation are not de rigueur for those opposed to
  embryo adoption. Embryo adoption can, and in my view should, be opposed
  because of the critical role biology plays in our society in creating a
  child’s sense of who they are, where they belong, and why they matter.
  
  Since the industrial revolution, when all rights and responsibilities
  for children - as well as children themselves - were placed in the hands
  of the nuclear family, biology has played a fundamental role in
  children’s understandings of who they are and where they belong.
  
  When Margaret Thatcher announced \`\`there is no such thing as society,
  only individuals and their families’’, she signalled the rise of
  economic rationalism as the dominant Western economic and social
  paradigm.
  
  An economically rational society is an itinerant and isolating one that
  espouses values that are the antithesis of those that bind individuals
  together. Extended families and local communities disintegrate in the
  absence of values such as trust, interdependence and responsibility,
  forfeiting their historical participation in the establishment of
  children’s knowledge of self and place.
  
  In such individualistic societies, it is largely children’s biological
  parents who are able to give children a sense of continuity: an
  understanding of who they are in relation to all those who have come
  before them. It is this social fact that partially explains why so many
  children and adults have found the experience of being adopted so
  traumatic.
  
  Recently, the first children born from anonymous sperm donations have
  begun telling similar stories of social dislocation and not belonging.
  Like those who have been adopted, these young people see the search for
  their biological parent/s as a critical step in discovering their
  \`\`true’’ identity.
  
  There is little doubt that that those adopted or conceived from
  anonymous sperm donation feel deprived in large part because most of the
  people in the world are raised by their \`\`own’’ parents. But this is
  precisely the point. The deprivation suffered by many adopted children
  and the children of anonymous sperm donors is profoundly social in
  nature.
  
  It is because - and only because - children lack a sense of belonging to
  a community from which they could draw a sense of self and place, that
  voluntarily creating more children who will suffer this deprivation
  becomes ethically dubious.
  
  ABC-TV’s Australian Story recently aired a program about a young woman
  who has continuing contact with the couple who adopted her baby. The
  child knows and loves his biological mother and, as he grows, will be
  told the circumstances that led her to relinquish him. By allowing the
  young woman to have an ongoing relationship with her biological child,
  such \`\`open’’ adoption procedures may go a long way towards minimising
  the distress adoption has caused in the past to both relinquishing
  mothers and adopted children.
  
  But providing ways for the relatively few children placed for adoption
  each year in Australia to maintain contact with their biological parents
  is a far cry from deliberately creating such children through the
  practice of creating and/or adopting embryos. While any child conceived
  from donated eggs or sperm has the right, on their 18th birthday, to
  full identifying information about their biological parents, such
  legislation falls far short of adequately compensating children for
  their loss.
  
  As numerous adult adoptees reveal, it is the non-deliberate nature of
  their conception that made the loss they had suffered as a result of
  their adoption easier to bear. No one had meant any harm. But if the
  child knows they were intentionally conceived in order to be
  \`\`donated‘’ by the infertility specialist, or donated by their
  biological parents to another infertile couple, all bets are off. Such
  children, worries one adult raised by adoptive parents, may wind up
  feeling like \`\`a commodity, a powerless pawn at the disposal’’ of the
  specialist, their biological parents, or both.
  
  As my research into women’s views of abortion showed, all solutions to
  an unwanted pregnancy - be it abortion, adoption or keeping the baby -
  involve pain. But unwanted pregnancies do happen, and for the few women
  who choose to resolve them by opting for adoption, open adoptions seem
  the way to go.
  
  But better still would be to refuse to conceive and/or \`\`donate’’
  those always intended to be raised by their non-biological parents. What
  possible defence will we give - when such children come knocking on our
  doors in 18 years time - for failing to do so?

  Late abortions are emotive fodder for those who deny women moral agency.
  
  ABORTION is in the news again, and once more the terms of the debate are
  heavily weighted against women. As usual, the anti-choice movement is
  trying to stir up anxiety about second-trimester abortions as a means of
  depicting women as unethical foetal containers.
  
  Those immersed in the abortion debate have long recognised that
  undermining women’s moral agency, not upholding the rights of the
  foetus, is the centrepiece of anti-choice strategy. Examples abound, but
  the most obvious is the anti-choice attitude to abortion choices in the
  hard cases: when the pregnancy is life-endangering or the result of rape
  or incest. If the anti-choice movement really opposed abortion because
  it denies the foetus its right to life, then they would oppose all
  abortions - hard case or not - with equal determination. After all, how
  the foetus is conceived has no bearing on its \`\`right to life’’.
  
  However, polls show that few anti-choicers outside the Pope’s intimate
  circle believe a women ought to be forced to sacrifice her life to bring
  her embryo to term, or to bring to term an embryo conceived through rape
  or incest.
  
  What the hard cases demonstrate is that what really lies behind
  anti-choice sentiment are mistaken views about the motives, intentions
  and feelings of women who choose abortion. Anti-choice rhetoric abounds
  with caricatures of women who seek abortions: women who abort because of
  their careers or their desires to go on ski trips or get into bikinis.
  The aim of the anti-choice movement is to convince the public to see
  abortion as proof that too many women hold all the wrong values about
  motherhood, womanhood and material possessions. That women who choose
  abortion are, to use Fred Nile’s shorthand, snarling hard-faced
  pro-abortion feminists.
  
  The fretting of anti-choicers about late-term abortions is part of this
  strategy. So while anti-choice concern appears to be about the
  almost-viable foetus, the strategy is really designed to demonstrate the
  incapacity of women to act as moral agents. What kind of a woman, they
  ask, could care so little for her baby that she would choose to delay
  having a termination for so long?
  
  The female, rather than foetal, target of anti-choice rhetoric is summed
  up well by anti-choice campaigner Margaret Tighe’s wonderment about why
  a woman seeking a second-trimester abortion doesn’t just \`\`go on and
  allow [her] baby to be born - I’m sure the Mafia would be happy to kill
  it for a much cheaper rate’’.
  
  The irony is that women’s intense concern for the wellbeing of their
  foetus and others whom they love and to whom they feel responsible is
  behind most decisions about unplanned pregnancies. Far from seeing
  herself as locked in an evolutionary and political conflict of interests
  with her foetus, the woman sees herself as responsible for her foetus:
  its protector, and the only person who can make the best and most caring
  decision about its fate.
  
  A woman doesn’t see her abortion decision as ethically justified because
  her rights override those of her foetus. She deems it ethical only if
  she has made a careful, responsible decision to forgo motherhood because
  she does not believe herself capable of parenting in the way she feels
  is right. Many of the women in my study, for example, felt strongly that
  before they had children, they should be financial, have a partner and
  be ready to take on the responsibilities of parenthood.
  
  Just 5per cent of abortions in Australia take place after 12 weeks’
  gestation. Half of these are done after 16 weeks, the vast majority for
  grief-stricken women with tragic amnio or scan results.
  
  If the anti-choice movement were really interested in reducing
  second-trimester rates, they would lobby to remove legislative
  impediments to Australian women accessing RU486. Ten years’ experience
  in France has shown that when women gain access to the abortion pill,
  the overall number of abortions remains steady, but more are had earlier
  in pregnancy.
  
  The anti-choice movement could also put its considerable funds into
  unearthing and providing all women with access to foetal diagnostic
  tools that are safe to use earlier in pregnancy, allowing women who
  terminate because of a heartbreaking diagnosis to do so sooner.
  
  And the movement could lobby for policies that would limit the abuse and
  ignorance that lead women to delay. An English study recently concluded
  that nearly all women seeking second-trimester terminations have severe
  social and psychological problems. Like the 12-year-old girl found to be
  26-weeks pregnant by her teacher. Her father in prison, her mother
  preoccupied with other children (she thought the girl’s weight gain was
  puppy fat), the girl said she had been raped in the lift of her block of
  flats. It turned out the alleged rapist was sexually involved with the
  mother.
  
  But, of course, the anti-choice movement has no intention of doing any
  of these things - because concern about the viability or rights of the
  foetus is not really the cause of their anxiety about second-trimester
  abortions. Second-trimester abortions are simply the emotive fodder used
  to gain public support for the goal of prohibiting all women from
  accessing safe and legal abortions at any point.
  
  Behind calls for prohibition is the belief that women so lack moral
  agency that the state would be justified in stripping them of their
  reproductive rights, thereby forcing all who conceive to mother.

  Protecting our loved ones is only natural in a world of un-met misery.
  
  TALK of human failings has been rife in The Age these past few weeks.
  First Peter Singer castigated us for spending spare dollars on luxuries
  rather than the needs of the world’s poor. Then Pamela Bone contrasted
  our ridiculous sentimentality for euthanased animals with our supposed
  indifference to starving children.
  
  Singer has spent much of his professional life trying to convince us the
  compassion we feel for those we love is a moral failing. Such feelings
  cloud our judgment and get in the way of a dispassionate assessment of
  the more deserving object of our ethical attention. Should his mother
  and a scientist known to be on the cusp of a cure for cancer both fall
  off a boat, with the time to save only one, Singer has argued he would
  and should save the scientist.
  
  When the New Yorker revealed that Singer spends his own money on private
  nursing care for his Alzheimer’s-affected mother rather than on feeding
  the world’s poor, many believed Singer a hypocrite.
  
  The truth is far worse. Paying for the private nursing is not Singer’s
  way of acknowledging he has been mistaken all these years about the
  value of the love, fidelity, gratitude and reciprocity that go into the
  partial attachment he has to his mother. Rather, Singer’s spending
  patterns simply reveal him to have an embarrassing weakness of will; an
  inability to live up to the standards he believes right. It is different
  when it’s your mother, he said sheepishly.
  
  The compassion we feel for those we love and to whom we are responsible
  is not a moral failing. The whole concept of intimate and enduring
  relationships becomes a nonsense if we are unable to love or be
  committed to certain people, and act on those commitments.
  
  What would we feel about the person who didn’t instinctively move
  towards their drowning mother? Or the parent who walks out the door with
  a cheery \`\`Sorry dear, can’t go to your school play, got to feed the
  starving children in Africa’’?
  
  I also don’t believe the strong reader response to The Age’s report on
  culling at Melbourne’s zoos means these readers lack the right amount of
  compassion for starving children. Not only do we want, and need, to
  focus most of our compassion on those for whom we care and feel
  responsible, we also, like Singer, want to act on such feelings. We feel
  compassion for the animals in the zoos. But, more importantly, we feel
  we understand the problem (a zoo policy that allows healthy animals to
  be put down) and believe we have the power to change it.
  
  World hunger is a different kettle of fish. I feel confident most people
  feel as much compassion - if not more - for starving humanity as they do
  for the meerkats. However, I suspect many are far less confident about
  the cause of the problem, and what they can do to help.
  
  Back in the 1970s, I gave my weekly allowance to an organisation
  collecting for the starving people of Ethiopia. The television
  voice-overs sourced the tragedy to the ravages of drought. I still
  remember the shock of discovering - years later - that the real source
  of food shortages in that part of the world is civil unrest.
  
  Of course, starvation is starvation, whatever the cause, and it is
  highly improbable those doing the starving had any say in how the good
  people collecting aid moneys made their case. But the point is that when
  we give money, we trust that the agency taking our funds actually
  understands the problem, and is giving it to us straight. Discovering
  this is not the case may leave us feeling used and deceived.
  
  This sense of disempowerment is exacerbated by the relentlessness of the
  world’s problems. If the policy is changed at the zoos, there will be a
  satisfying sense of closure. (There! That’s fixed and I helped.) There
  will also, in all likelihood, be a long break before there is a need to
  feel for and act on behalf of those animals again.
  
  In contrast, the never-ending stream of misery pouring from our radios
  and televisions offers neither closure nor respite from the insistent
  feeling - engendered by our compassion - that we are obligated to help.
  When will it all end, we wonder. Nothing ever changes, we wail. Like the
  dogs in the learned helplessness experiments, many of us resign
  ourselves to the daily onslaught of un-met human misery, convinced
  there’s no point in trying to make things different, and no longer
  willing to try.
  
  I am not excusing our reluctance or refusal to do what we can for
  unknown others in need. Most of us can and should do more. Indeed, I
  like Singer’s suggestion that we donate 10percent of our earnings to
  charity. But we betray a fundamental misunderstanding of the feelings
  and behavior necessary to maintain meaningful human relationships -
  families, friendships, communities - when we dismiss as moral weakness
  our honoring of the impulse to put the needs of our own children,
  parents and friends first.
  
  In the same way, it is far too glib to propose a compassion deficit as
  the reason relatively little fuss is made when images of starvation in
  far-away lands hit the front page. It is far more likely our silence is
  the outcome of our inability to understand the nature of the problem,
  and our helpless belief that nothing we do will make a damn bit of
  difference.

  JENNY McCARTNEY’S hand-wringing about the preoccupation of the modern
  Western woman with vanity and consumption (on this page, 6/1) has a
  familiar ring to it. I am 34 now, and for as long as I can remember,
  responsible society has been exhorting me and my fellow female
  travellers to consider what we might have time to think about were we
  spending less time thinking about the shapes of our bodies.
  
  While the description of the problem is accurate, the diagnosis is way
  off.
  
  It is a shame that women invest too much time, emotional energy and
  money in their appearance. But the problem is not caused, as McCartney
  and others suggest, by the failings either of individual women or women
  as a gender.
  
  For one thing, men are fast becoming as invested in their appearance as
  are women. The repetitive advice offered by men’s magazines about how to
  get an abdominal \`\`six pack’’ and slim down makes this clear, as does
  men’s fast-growing participation in plastic surgery. (They make up
  between 20 and 30 per cent of cosmetic surgery patients.) This is not a
  gender problem, but one belonging to all members of modern Western
  societies.
  
  The philosopher Margaret Somerville describes such societies as
  multicultural, pluralist, individualistic, secular, post-modern and
  post-materialist. What she means is that Australians (and Americans,
  Canadians and Britons) are no longer bound by a collective culture, a
  common religion or a shared modernist belief in the capacity of reason
  and science to fuel inexorable progress towards greater knowledge and
  social and moral improvement.
  
  We also are no longer primarily occupied, as were all humans before us,
  with the business of survival. What all these \`\`posts’’ mean, says
  Somerville, is that while we know who we were and what we used to
  believe in, we don’t know who we are and what we believe in now. This
  leaves us with a bit of time on our hands and a historically
  unprecedented lack of identity and sense of purpose to guide our use of
  it.
  
  The same existential nasties still plague us - who are we and what is
  the purpose and meaning of our lives? - but there are fewer givens and
  minimal guidance to help us choose from an ever-expanding array of
  belief and identity choices. Should we become a Buddhist, or a Wicca
  Witch? Volunteer our time to save the environment or build a CV in
  pursuit of a career?
  
  While existentialists such as Jean-Paul Sartre urge us to revel in our
  freedom to define the essence of ourselves and our lives, some
  experience such vast freedoms and the accompanying panoply of choices as
  distinctly unliberating. Confused and without the navigational compass
  provided by a core sense of self and purpose, we are vulnerable to the
  entreaties of any passing group or ideology that claims to have the
  answers.
  
  In capitalist countries, the most extensively promoted and widely
  available answer is consumerism. A certain car promises jump-in-the-air
  exuberance and certain margarines claim to deliver mothers much
  sought-after affirmation and appreciation of their sacrifices.
  Particular perfumes or clothing labels pledge to make us feel ourselves
  to be a certain kind of person (dignified, chic, worth it).
  
  The products we are told to buy change like the weather. The message
  that we must buy something to be something remains the same.
  
  It was inevitable that the pressure to define ourselves by where we put
  our bodies, and what we put them in, would give way to pressure to alter
  them. Striving for a particular shape at the gym keeps us busy, gives us
  a certain self-defining look and helps us achieve the work success
  and/or spunky partner that contributes to a socially valued identity.
  
  Plastic surgery can take us where the gym cannot, as well as delay the
  inevitable identity crisis facing those who have put most of their
  identity eggs in the young and pretty/handsome/fit basket. Of course,
  tying our identity up with our looks is not always a matter of choice.
  Many men having face-lifts say a more youthful appearance is essential
  to keeping or succeeding at their job.
  
  But it doesn’t have to be this way. Pollster Daniel Yankelovich says
  Americans yearn to break free of the boundaries and limits of material
  possessions, career and money and find some form of transcendence. Simon
  Longstaff, of the Sydney-based St James Ethics Centre, says the same is
  true for Australians. Generation X employees in particular seek
  meaningful work in companies in which they can feel proud.
  
  The ultimately unsatisfying nature of the answers that consumerism gives
  to our existential queries also provides a window of opportunity into
  which more worthy and substantive solutions to our post-modernist
  dilemmas can be levered.
  
  But the first step to embracing such opportunities is to stop viewing
  consumerist self-obsession as the peculiar moral failings of individual
  women or a peculiar genetic failure unique to those with two
  Xchromosomes.
  
  Vanity is merely the symptom of identity deficit disorder, an ailment of
  our particular time and place that affects us all. To remedy it, we will
  need historically situated and socially based solutions.

  A lot has been said in the past two weeks about the devastation wrought
  on children by bullies. I wince when I hear the stories, wince through
  identification and with shame.
  
  I was bullied in school - but I was also a bully.
  
  It is easier to talk about being a victim than of victimising others, to
  speak of abused innocence rather than malevolent guilt. It’s also easier
  because I remember so much more about the emotions and strategies of
  victimisation - the initial show of defiance that began the bullying,
  the weeks spent hiding out during recess in the library, and the
  negotiated settlement that brought me respite, but turned the heat on a
  new victim.
  
  When it happened the next time, several years later in a different
  school, I waited out my social exile with greater equanimity. I still
  hid out, this time with those on the periphery of my gang forced to take
  remedial English during lunch, but was confident that adherence to my
  mother’s instruction - “don’t react and they’ll find someone more
  interesting to tease” - would eventually bring the warring party to the
  table. When it did, I turned the bristling discontent at the general
  nastiness of gang leadership and its penchant for internal bullying into
  a revolt that landed me in the gang’s Top Dog position.
  
  In America, such a girl wins the epithet “most popular girl”. I
  discovered this when, several years after graduating from university, I
  ran into a boy who’d been in my year at school and who introduced me to
  his mother with this title.
  
  During those years, I was unaware of the power our gang’s casual cruelty
  or even indifference had over classmates - they were terrified of us,
  something I learned in my last year of high school. I had dropped out of
  the main high school to become a student at the Alternative (or “A”)
  school after ditching cheerleading, gaining a few stones and performing
  other rituals associated with a popular-girl-drop-out. I was washing my
  hands when a fellow “A”-schooler casually remarked: “I remember when you
  and your gang had the biggest screaming match in here. You were there,
  and Amy was there and Cynthia was crying and then someone called me a
  geek and pushed Vicki into a stall and she hit her leg and got a bruise
  mark that lasted for weeks. And then …” The story went on and on.
  
  While my new friend recalled every last insult and each casual cruelty,
  I remembered none of it. What sounded like a formative experience for
  her I couldn’t even recall.
  
  The one thing I do remember is the impact the words of a teacher had on
  my behavior.
  
  Flash back to junior high school. I’m 11 and playing Robyn to Cynthia’s
  Batman. Back then, she wasn’t just “the prettiest girl”, she was also
  “the most popular”.
  
  Our prey was Sarah, a girl cursed with parents who were among the most
  hated teachers at school. Sarah’s mother also refused to buy her a bra
  to soften out the sharp points of her developing breasts. These were the
  “crimes” as I remember them, and Cynthia and I made Sarah pay dearly.
  
  We teased what she said and how she said it, we mocked her clothes, and
  the size and wantonness of her breasts. We encouraged the boys, all
  eager to curry our favor, to give her titty twisters.
  
  Ms Moore, a kind grandmotherly woman, held us back one afternoon after
  dismissing the rest of the class.
  
  “You are both beautiful and bright girls,” she said gently, “but you are
  behaving cruelly to Sarah.”
  
  Cynthia and I protested that it was the boys, but Ms Moore cut us off.
  “I think you both know what you are doing and it’s wrong. The other kids
  look up to you and follow you, if you stop, they’ll follow your lead.”
  
  She dismissed us with a disappointed wave of her hand.
  
  Cynthia was incensed that we had been singled out for treatment when the
  whole class had participated in Sarah’s torture. I listened to her rant
  in silence, mortified and deeply ashamed.
  
  I made sure in the intervening years that I remained silent and
  peripheral to the group when we’d roam the playground in our clogs -
  earning us the moniker “The Herd” - in search of a victim.
  
  I still remember trailing The Herd with Jill, both of us trying to
  become as small as possible when proceedings had begun with the day’s
  victim. We were ashamed but remained silent for years, too afraid that
  speaking up would turn the abuse on us.
  
  When I ascended the “most popular” throne, my reign was characterised by
  an absence of internecine and extra-curricular bullying and Jill’s
  status in the group metamorphosed from hanger-on to “second most popular
  girl”.
  
  But I’ll forgive our victims if they didn’t even notice.

  The latest theory out of America about rape is not just wrong, it’s
  dangerous.
  
  AMERICAN band Green Day’s Nice Guys Finish Last came in at No. 89 in
  this summer’s Hottest 100 on Triple J. But if the social Darwinian
  theories of American academics Randy Thornhill and Greg Palmer are
  right, some of the guys who finish last in the race for partners aren’t
  very nice guys.
  
  You’ve got to say one thing for Thornhill and Palmer, they sure know how
  to grab media attention. A few weeks ago, they were Dr Nobodies: one
  holed up in the anthropology department at the University of Colorado,
  the other with his face pressed to the glass of scorpionfly cages in New
  Mexico. Now their theories have been headlined in The Chicago Tribune,
  The New York Times, USA Today, Time Magazine, The Washington Post and
  The Guardian. They’ve been on Rush Limbaugh’s radio program, CNN, the
  CBS Early Show with Bryant Gumbel, and NBC’s Today Show, to name a few.
  
  Clearly the strategy of accusing feminist beliefs - in this case that
  rape is motivated by a male thirst for power rather than sex - of being
  one-eyed and evidence-free is the calling-card for success with the
  overseas and domestic press.
  
  Unfortunately, both Thornhill and Palmer seem unperturbed by the fact
  that the evidence they provide to support their claims is flimsy and at
  times nonsensical.
  
  They contend that rape is an unchangeable though undesirable biological
  phenomenon, much like a tornado or flood, and that it is about sex (by
  which they mean the Darwinian, programmed desire of all animals to pass
  on their genes). Men who have been unsuccessful in attracting a female
  with whom to copulate consensually use rape as a strategy to pass along
  their genetic legacy.
  
  But the most persuasive evidence Thornhill and Palmer could muster - and
  I am truly too embarrassed to repeat their less convincing supporting
  facts - are that most rape victims are women of child-bearing age, and
  that rape occurs in a variety of animal species.
  
  What they fail to mention is that most rapists are also of child-bearing
  age. Not only are these men more likely to have greater access to
  similarly aged women, but women of this age are more likely than the
  very young or very old to be out and about and so at risk of stranger
  rape. They are also more likely to be socially and sexually active and
  so at higher risk of “date” rape.
  
  Evolutionary academics have a penchant for picking from the natural
  world that which suits their usually sexist theories, and ignoring the
  rest. This means that the naturalness of human breeding and
  child-rearing practices are never explained with reference to the
  extracurricular sexual activities of the female emu, which roots around
  while the male stays back at the nest hatching the eggs. Instead, they
  are seen as akin - in this case - to the mating habits of scorpionflies.
  
  The scorpionfly, we are told, has a clamp-like appendage that seems
  specially designed for rape. While no similar appendage has yet been
  located on the human male, our headline doctors proffer this discovery
  as proof of the pervasiveness of rape in the animal kingdom, and so the
  naturalness and immutability of its occurrence among humans. In my view,
  scorpionfly behavior tells us as much (or as little) as does emu
  behavior about what is natural for humans. Call me a nut.
  
  But the strongest piece of evidence the Darwinian theory of rape has
  going for it - other than prime-time ratings - is the simple fact that
  many sexual assaults do not involve the rapist penetrating the woman’s
  vagina with his penis. And even when he does, he doesn’t always
  ejaculate. In addition, men rape other men, old women and children, a
  third of whom are boys. This, if I am not mistaken, puts the
  men-rape-to-spread-their-genes-around theory in a bit of a bind. It
  means that unless the evolutionary drive isn’t the brightest light in
  the harbor, it is a bad explanation for why and whom men choose to rape.
  
  And if rape is a “successful” reproductive strategy, as our academics
  claim, you’ve got to wonder for whom. Sexual selection is a key aspect
  of Darwin’s survival-of-the-fittest theory. Put crudely, it gives female
  desires a strong say in the selection of a species’ characteristics.
  Peacock plumage is a lightning rod for the bird’s predators, yet by
  making the cock more attractive to the hen, the bird with the largest,
  most colorful plumage is at an advantage in the sexual selection stakes.
  
  If a woman knocks back a bloke’s request for consensual sex, and he
  rapes her, he upsets the delicate balance of sexual selection by -
  should he actually impregnate her - spreading his \`\`unfit’’ genes
  around. Good for the individual male in question, maybe. Good - in
  Darwinian terms - for the human species? I don’t think so.
  
  Thornhill and Palmer’s reinstatement of the boys-will-be-boys thesis
  about why men rape has upset both men and women. Men are peeved at being
  re-tarred with the all-men-are-potential-rapists brush. Women involved
  in counselling sexual assault survivors are worried that such
  theoretical walks in the woods might reverse hard-won political, legal
  and treatment trends that lay responsibility for sexual violence at
  men’s feet, rather than at women’s hemlines.
  
  But they needn’t worry. Claims by some angry anti-feminists that
  Thornhill and Palmer’s work is being knocked off by an aggressive case
  of feminist political correctness - the standard ploy for keeping
  anti-feminist agendas in the media for longer than they merit - won’t
  work for long. Thornhill and Palmer’s thesis simply doesn’t stack up.
  And there are too many nice (and knowledgeable) men and women that say
  so.

  Working parents may not be able to rely on the women’s movement to help
  them.
  
  JOHN HOWARD is no feminist. So perhaps it’s no surprise that his
  recently stated desire to promote a better balance between work and
  family by extending school hours went down like a lead balloon with
  feminists.
  
  While the reasons for this are complex, several important ones suggest
  that the women’s movement may no longer be the best organisation to
  articulate the plight of working parents, and to fight for a
  re-balancing of their employment and family responsibilities.
  
  The difficulties that school hours and school holidays pose for working
  parents are legion. While schools are only one institution posing
  problems for working parents, and institutions only one source of the
  imbalance equation, Howard’s comments provided an opening to press for a
  round-table discussion on the issue. Such a summit should include
  high-level representatives of parents, teachers, young people, business
  and government.
  
  Polls in America, Britain and Australia show that women nominate the
  lack of balance between their work and family responsibilities as their
  most pressing problem. Yet emerging data suggests that men increasingly
  expect to play an active role in raising their children, despite
  spending an average of four hours more a week at the office than women.
  
  Indeed, Australian Bureau of Statistics figures last week showed that
  about a third of managers, professionals and associate professionals -
  most of whom are male, parents and aged between 35 and 60 - want to work
  fewer hours.
  
  So why did the women’s movement drop the ball on Howard’s
  need-for-better-balance comments? One important reason was the desire
  not to antagonise teachers (most of whom are women) and the teachers
  union, which is a traditional ally. The union came out early against the
  plan because of understandable fears that its implementation would be
  inadequately funded, and so come at the cost of already overburdened
  teachers.
  
  But good mummy/bad mummy politics may also have played a part in the
  speedy rejection of Howard’s plan. Letters from concerned parents and
  children flooded newspapers, defending the well-earned right of children
  to go home at 3.30 to frolic in the creek, pick daisies in the park and
  otherwise rejuvenate.
  
  The Opposition Leader, Kim Beazley, joined in the condemnation of
  uncaring parents who might support the plan when he rejected it on the
  grounds that he would \`\`not want (his) child (riding home) on the
  roads’’ at 5pm.
  
  The sub-textual condemnation of working parents in general and working
  mothers in particular is not hard to discern, although several letters
  spelt it out anyway: children should not suffer longer hours at school
  for the convenience of their career-driven mothers. Such charges of
  selfishness were not only levelled at any woman who would dare speak up
  in support of the extended school hours plan, but tarred all those whose
  children are enrolled in out-of-school-hours programs.
  
  Good mummy/bad mummy politics are a landmine for the women’s movement.
  Many women marching under the anti-feminist or the
  I’m-not-a-feminist-but banners believe, rightly or wrongly, that the
  feminist movement supports only working women, and devalues the role of
  those who choose to defer or play down workforce participation to care
  for their children.
  
  The women’s movement’s support for Howard’s proposal would only further
  entrench these women’s beliefs that feminists see little value in their
  decision not to work, or to work part-time to be there when the school
  bell rings at 3.30.
  
  Limited resources (for example, the Howard Government recently de-funded
  the Women’s Electoral Lobby) is another reason the women’s movement
  would benefit from concentrating all its attention on traditional
  feminist and unquestionably gender-based issues concerning women and
  work - issues such as equal pay, sexual harassment and glass ceilings.
  
  Ironically, such a concentration may also bring more women back into the
  feminist fold because nearly all women believe - no matter how
  stridently anti-feminist their rhetoric - that they have a right to as
  much pay, as much safety and as much opportunity for advancement at work
  as any man.
  
  Bringing men into the fight for work/family balance better reflects the
  reality and ideal of male involvement in parenting. More importantly,
  until working fathers start kicking up a fuss - and threatening to down
  tools, alongside working mothers - nothing is going to change.
  
  School hours are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the
  problems facing working mothers and fathers. Working parents missed the
  opportunity that Howard’s comments offered to begin a discussion at the
  community and political level about the degraded quality of life they
  and their children have as a result of the incongruence between
  institutions such as school and work, and the demands of parenthood. It
  may be that we can no longer expect the women’s movement to take up this
  fight on our behalf.
  
  Perhaps, if we use the time until the Government’s next political
  opening organising a new movement for change - I’d call it Parents for
  Balance - we won’t have to see the next opportunity float by.

  I LOVE The Vicar of Dibley and Dawn French’s vicar, Geraldine Granger.
  But after most episodes, my stomach hurts - figuratively, that is. Which
  may be better than the literal way the vicar’s must feel. Because at
  some point in each episode of the show, Geraldine does some serious
  eating: a freezer’s worth of icecream, a cupboard full of chocolate
  bars, an entire Yule Log. That sort of thing.
  
  I know that as a feminist I’m meant to feel liberated by the vicar’s
  eating. Because - and here I quote French’s own website - underlying
  French’s comedy sketches about her \`\`chocaholism‘’ and her weight is a
  \`\`message for all of us to read. Dawn French is fat. And beautiful.
  And proud.’’
  
  French believes, the website goes on, that being big is \`\`something to
  celebrate rather than be ashamed of‘’. Indeed, French has launched her
  own clothing shops that provide \`\`beautiful clothes’’ for big girls,
  and she has posed nude for Esquire magazine in a bid to create
  \`\`modern images‘’ of women where \`\`big means beautiful’’.
  
  I support French’s contention that big women can be beautiful, and
  should be proud. I believe \`\`society‘’ and \`\`the media’’ should get
  off the backs of all women - be they Calista Flockhart or Camryn Manheim
  - about their body size. But is that really the message the vicar
  delivers?
  
  To some degree, yes. Geraldine is not just her crammed cream buns, and
  ironically it is when she is not eating that the \`\`fat is beautiful’’
  message comes through loud and clear. The vicar is clearly happy with
  and proud of her body.
  
  But when the vicar begins eating, all bets are off. This is not because
  I’m squeamish about fat people eating - yes I know they had to get fat
  somehow - but because of the way and the reasons why the vicar eats. She
  eats compulsively, sometimes in a highly stylised or ritualised manner,
  usually when she isn’t hungry and as a way of expressing - or it is
  repressing? - her feelings.
  
  When anorexics and bulimics do this, we label it a disease and try,
  often fruitlessly, to treat it. We understand eating in this way is a
  symptom of these women’s unhappiness: a sign of anger and powerlessness
  turned in against the self. Yet when the vicar eats an entire
  display-sized freezer full of Haagen Daz as a sop for her broken heart,
  we laugh. When she proceeds on to the avalanche of Crunchies stored
  under the sink with a resigned \`\`I suppose I better start on these
  then‘’, we enthuse, \`\`right on sister!’’
  
  It’s easy to see how we got so confused. Big \`\`role models‘’ for women
  are in short supply. French not only accepts this position
  enthusiastically, she uses her social and financial clout to expose the
  consumerist evils of the diet industry and the bias against fat women
  that riddles our society. She rightly lambasts the entertainment
  industry for pigeonholing fat women by insisting all roles have to have
  \`\`big’’ in the job description.
  
  French and her characters challenge the stigma about women eating at all
  in public, little less eating fattening things and lots of them - and we
  love her for it.
  
  Yet in our adoration, we have ignored the fact that some of Geraldine’s
  attitudes and behaviors around food cross the line. We wouldn’t cheer so
  briskly if, after downing the last chocolate bar, the vicar made a brisk
  joke about toothbrush handles and headed for the toilet. But does
  wolfing down food - despite being full and as a salve for emotional pain
  - display any less confusion about the relationship between eating and
  emotion than wolfing it up?
  
  Research tells us that most women who are compulsive eaters aren’t
  happy. Food runs their lives and they feel out of control. Women deserve
  the freedom to be whatever size they want and to have a healthy
  relationship with food. The model French provides in the vicar takes us
  only half way.

  It’s easier to talk about immigration than about why we’re having fewer
  children.
  
  LAST week the Prime Minister reopened the debate about Australia’s
  population. After years of Hanson-inspired silence, there are even
  whispers of a bipartisan policy approach.
  
  Debates in Australia about population policy typically disintegrate into
  haggling about migration numbers, and this time was no different.
  Indeed, some media outlets didn’t even bother to report Howard’s
  interest in a comprehensive debate about population, while others gave
  only a one-line mention to his open mind on population. Instead, the
  media focused on the Government’s policy shift on migrant numbers.
  
  Population is not a synonym for migration, so why do politicians and the
  media constantly equate the two? More importantly, who loses out when
  they do?
  
  The size of our population is primarily determined by how many babies we
  have. Over the past decade, Australia’s fertility rate has dropped
  precipitously. Australian woman averaged 1.9 babies at the start of the
  1990s; by the end of the decade the figure was 1.75.
  
  What this means is that each year Australians move further away from
  bringing enough children into the world - around 2.1 per woman - to
  replace the number of Australians dying.
  
  In this, we are far from alone. Few Western countries have fertility
  levels that are at or above replacement levels.
  
  Yet despite sporadic fretting about declining fertility in the Western
  world - an Italian demographer recently predicted the demise of the
  Italian people unless that country was able to halt the fall in its
  fertility rate - no committees are being assembled and research
  commissioned to investigate the problem and propose policy solutions.
  
  One reason is the difficulty in even gaining agreement that falling
  population is a problem. Some contend, among them the New South Wales
  Premier, Bob Carr, that our current numbers are overwhelming our fragile
  ecosystem and limited infrastructure.
  
  Those in favor of population growth tend to be economic rationalists
  convinced that greater numbers will fuel economic prosperity and lift
  our international standing. In addition, patriarchal societies have long
  seen child-bearing as a woman’s patriotic duty. As Jeff Kennett
  discovered, this can make any mention of the issue politically risky.
  
  If declining fertility represented the desire of increasing numbers of
  women and men to have fewer children or no children at all, I’d fully
  support the current do-nothing-and-for-God’s-sake-don’t-talk-about-it
  approach.
  
  However, what little data is available suggests that the steady decline
  in Australia’s birthrate since 1961 is evidence of the ever-widening gap
  between the number of children we want, and the number of children we
  have.
  
  The problem with falling population, in other words, is that it
  represents an erosion of women’s and men’s freedom to embrace
  parenthood.
  
  For instance, one study found that tertiary-educated Australian women in
  their 20s intended to have an average of 2.3 children each, but as they
  moved into their 30s, their expectations dropped sharply. At current
  rates, these women are not even likely to meet their lowered fertility
  expectations.
  
  Less educated women, while wanting on average just under two children
  each, come much closer to having the number they want. However, this may
  be about to change. New figures from the Australian Institute of Family
  Studies show that while fertility rates are dropping for all women,
  those of less educated women with poorer job prospects are declining
  quickest of all. What all this means is that the longstanding
  relationship in developing countries between higher rates of female
  education and lower rates of fertility doesn’t explain fertility
  patterns in the developed world. It seems higher education and
  employment levels don’t lead women to want fewer children, but to have
  fewer than they want.
  
  The reasons for this are not hard to guess. Getting educated takes time,
  and leads women to put off having children. Getting established in a
  career also takes time, and leads women to delay even longer. Getting so
  established at work that a woman is able to negotiate a family-friendly
  work arrangement that won’t bankrupt her, turn her hair grey or put her
  on the mummy track could conceivably - in a time of unequal opportunity
  and pay - take a lifetime.
  
  The limited lifespan of female fertility means such delays may result in
  a woman having fewer children than she intended, or no children at all.
  
  The upshot of all this is that the incompatibility of child-bearing and
  child-rearing with the demands of the lean and mean modern-day workforce
  - and the aggravation of that incompatibility by sex discrimination - is
  an issue that bears directly on the population question. No wonder
  politicians are happy to restrict debates on population to questions of
  immigration. Debates on the causes of declining fertility could make
  arguments about migrant numbers look like fun.
  
  But curtailment of this important debate comes at a high cost for
  present and potential parents and children. So, as our political leaders
  gear up for the annual carry-on about migrant numbers, prospective and
  actual parents need to ensure their elected representatives canvass all
  the causes and cures for our declining numbers.
  
  The wellbeing of our families - and the existence of those we hope to
  have - depends on it.

  A new ruling may end discrimination in access to donor sperm.
  
  SHOULD everyone have the freedom to parent? Fitness for parenthood has
  been a hot topic in Victoria recently. Reports of children locked in hot
  cars, and the Melbourne Magistrates Court’s dismissal of charges against
  two gay police officers who used IVF to have a baby, have forced us to
  think about who is - and is not - fit to parent.
  
  Questions of parental fitness are unlikely to have confronted the
  parents of the children left in cars, because most were - or appeared to
  be - straight, married and fertile. But because both police officers are
  gay and the female cop is involved in a stable de facto relationship
  with another woman, they are forbidden under the Victorian Infertility
  Treatment Act from access to assisted reproductive technology, including
  donor sperm. The act also denies treatment to single women.
  
  The thinking behind these denials is clear: that it is not in a child’s
  interests to be born to single women or lesbian couples, because these
  women are not fit parents.
  
  The singling out of single women and lesbians as unfit parents is
  staggeringly inconsistent and unfair. Widows are single parents, yet no
  one suggests the lack of a male partner makes them unfit mothers.
  
  Being gay is like being black or male or straight - a natural attribute
  beyond a person’s control and irrelevant to her capacity to get the job
  done. Numerous studies examining the wellbeing of children of single
  women and lesbians show such children generally fare well.
  
  The impulse to differentiate between those who should and should not be
  entrusted with the responsibilities of parenthood is ubiquitous,
  understandable and - at times - honorable. Who among us hasn’t muttered,
  “there oughtta be a law” upon news of a particularly heinous case of
  child abuse?
  
  Thoughts of restricting the freedom to parent, however, founder on the
  rocks of implementation. When, how often and in what manner would the
  parental fitness of the enormous population of fertile people be
  assessed, and by whom? How would a person deemed unfit to parent be
  stopped from having a child: mandatory weekly pregnancy tests and forced
  abortions?
  
  Controlling the physically infertile or those - such as lesbian or
  single women - facing social infertility is a less overwhelming task.
  Perhaps that’s why there are various state laws and codes that attempt
  it.
  
  Parenting is a responsibility, not a right, and the past behavior of
  some individuals may suggest they are not up to the task. But the key
  concepts here are \`\`past behavior‘’ and \`\`individuals’’. While it
  may be legitimate to deny a person the right to infertility treatment at
  a particular time because of what he or she did - raped a child or
  committed another violent crime, for instance - it is wrong to deny them
  treatment because of who they are. Would the state propose or the public
  support attempts to restrict access to infertility treatment to those of
  Greek heritage because they are Greek?
  
  Basing criteria for excluding individuals from treatment on behavior
  rather than identity assumes all prospective parents are fit, and places
  the burden of proof to show otherwise on the Government.
  
  For many people, children give their life a meaning and purpose they
  cannot envision getting elsewhere. This makes depriving people of their
  freedom to have children as serious as hell: something to be done only
  on the basis of evidence, and only as a last resort.
  
  Not only is discrimination against single women and lesbians morally
  wrong, the former unquestionably contravenes the Federal Sex
  Discrimination Act. A little-reported Human Rights and Equal Opportunity
  Commission judgment handed down the day before last Christmas found the
  Royal Women’s Hospital discriminated when it denied a woman access to
  donor sperm because she was single, and awarded damages against the
  hospital. Melbourne IVF specialist Dr John McBain has just launched a
  case in the Federal Court that, if successful, will strike down the
  discriminatory provisions of the ITA.
  
  However, single women may be able to gain access to donor sperm before
  McBain’s case is decided. That is because any hospital that denies them
  treatment may - should the woman file a complaint - wind up in the
  Federal Court on a sex discrimination charge.
  
  The federal sex discrimination commissioner, Susan Halliday, says: \`\`I
  am happy to receive complaints on this issue and, where there is
  legitimate discrimination on the basis of marital status, I will accept
  those complaints.’’
  
  My advice to any woman who fears she is running out of time and is
  willing to call herself single is this: get ye to your nearest
  infertility clinic with a copy of the HREOC judgment in your hot little
  hands! There are no guarantees, but you never know your luck in a big
  city.

  Both new parents, not just mum, should get time off work.
  
  Nurse to Kathy Lette, in excruciating pain from labor, and awaiting the
  father of her child in the ward: \`\`Don’t worry. Some men just don’t
  want to be here.’’
  
  Lette, angrily: \`\`Hey. I‘d prefer not to be here!’’
  
  TONY BLAIR has admitted he isn’t sure whether he’ll take paternity leave
  inMay, when wife Cherie is due to drop the couple’s fourth bundle. While
  Cherie was publicly expressing her interest in seeing Tony take
  advantage of his right to leave, he was mumbling about his pressing
  responsibilities to ensure the country was properly run.
  
  An astounding 57 per cent of Britons agreed that, while it is a good
  idea for a new father to take time off to help, Tony’s job was too
  important for him to do so.
  
  Of course, Cherie also has an important job. She’s a QC, a judge and a
  leading employment rights lawyer. However, no prizes for guessing how
  the British public would have responded had she announced her intention
  to get straight back to work after the baby was born. \`\`I have a
  courtroom to run,’’ one can hear her insisting, while she dodges rotten
  tomatoes and the deafening sound of public accusations of bad
  motherhood.
  
  The point, of course, is that despite the calendar showing the year
  2000, many people still hold distinctly 1950s views about the
  differences between the feelings mothers and fathers have about new
  babies, and their respective responsibilities for child care.
  
  Such dated mythology holds that the maternal instinct leads women to
  yearn to provide infant care, and to be uniquely suited to doing so. So
  fulfilled are women by nurturing babies in their bodies and at their
  breasts that they don’t even notice - little less mind - the devastating
  impact the baby has on their former existence as a grown-up. They yearn
  to take time out from their careers and to be there at those 3am feeds.
  The symbiotic nature of the maternal-child bond also means the baby is
  completely satiated by its mother’s - but only its mother’s - nurturing
  and love.
  
  So where exactly does that leave Dad? Most likely folding the laundry,
  screening calls and worrying about paying the mounting pile of bills
  with no money coming in. No wonder he yearns to stay at work, or to get
  back as soon as possible. It is at work that his role outside and inside
  the family is socially recognised and sanctioned: as paid worker and
  family breadwinner.
  
  While both the British and Australian Governments mandate the provision
  of parental leave (up to 52 weeks for Australian mums and dads, and 13
  weeks for British dads and 40 for mums), only British mums are entitled
  to be paid for any of that. While the enormous costs to working mothers
  of unpaid maternity leave are recognised, the cost to working fathers is
  less often discussed.
  
  The governments’ refusal to ensure adequate paid paternity leave
  reinforces the view that men are dispensable at home, but not at work.
  Few families can afford to go without both earners for long, and
  maternal mythology and the greater likelihood that a workplace agreement
  will ensure the woman gets at least part of her maternity leave paid,
  makes it more likely the person staying at home will be mum.
  
  The Swedes solve this problem by providing a full year of parental leave
  paid at 85per cent of the lost wage, at least a month of which must be
  taken by the father or forfeited. By paying fathers and mothers to
  parent, the Swedish Government is reinforcing family-values talk with
  real action - action that ensures parents understand that their
  contribution as a parent as well as as a worker is socially valued.
  
  Blair has been criticised by some commentators for refusing to make what
  amounts to the symbolic gesture of taking a week or two of paternity
  leave. But taking paternity leave must have more than symbolic value to
  truly transform the social and parental roles of men and women.
  
  Regardless of which way Blair jumps, the behavior of British fathers
  towards paternity leave - and paternity in general - is unlikely to
  change until they are told, in both words and dollars, that they are as
  needed and important at home as they are at the office.

  Giving Sorrow Words, By Melinda Tankard-Reist, Duffy & Snellgrove,
  $17.95
  
  Are women who have abortions free moral agents or coerced victims?
  
  THE bulk of Giving Sorrow Words consists of 19 edited stories of women’s
  grief after abortion. The stories, and the introduction and afterword
  that sandwich them, emphasise female victimhood. In Melinda
  Tankard-Reist’s world, women are coerced into having sex and abortions
  they don’t want by their husbands, their parents, their doctors and, of
  course, feminists and abortionists.
  
  Quoting American anti-pornography campaigner Catharine MacKinnon
  approvingly, Tankard-Reist asserts that women have been tricked into
  believing they want and benefit from the contraceptives and abortion
  that underpin their sexual freedom. Instead, abortion was legalised to
  serve a man’s requirements for sexual access to women and free him of
  the inconvenient results of that access, children.
  
  Indeed, reading Giving Sorrow Words is like time-warping back to the
  victim feminist hey-day of the late 1970s and "80s. There’s Adrienne
  Rich asserting that abortion is violence against women, Catharine
  MacKinnon insisting that most women only have sex because they are
  regularly forced or pressured, and Germaine Greer claiming that women’s
  real vulnerability in the matter of reproduction makes their claims to
  any choice in the matter a fiction.
  
  Such victim rhetoric - now largely discredited - reflected the struggle
  of radical feminists to explain why women continued to mother - some
  even pursuing painful infertility treatments to do so - despite their
  assertions that motherhood was the locus of female oppression.
  
  Similarly, Tankard-Reist struggles to depict women as helpless,
  indoctrinated, coerced victims who lack any trace of moral agency in
  order to explain why they have sex when they don’t want to become
  mothers, and abort unwanted pregnancies. It is only once she has
  demonstrated that all women have sex, use contraception and have
  abortions against their will, that she can claim that the prohibitionist
  policies on abortion supported by her long-time employer Senator Brian
  Harradine actually liberate women.
  
  It’s a big agenda, and one at which she fails miserably. Because what
  becomes clear as one turns page after page of what even Tankard-Reist
  admits makes bleak reading is that what women find so painful are
  problematic pregnancies, not problematic abortions.
  
  As the stories, and the recent NHMRC Information Paper on Termination of
  Pregnancy in Australia makes clear, one of the biggest predictors of
  ongoing ambivalence after abortion (a phenomenon experienced by only 2
  per cent of aborting women) is coercion. This coercion can come in the
  form of social circumstances - such as unemployment - that women feel
  preclude them from being a good mother, and abusive or threatening
  husbands/boyfriends or parents.
  
  Aside from the ongoing pursuit by feminists of social equity and justice
  for women, feminist abortion service providers operating in public
  free-standing clinics seek to enhance female autonomy by adhering to
  best-practice information and counselling guidelines. Such an approach
  acknowledges the woman’s values and competence as a moral
  decision-maker.
  
  It is unfortunate that proper counselling is an expense some private
  operators seek to avoid. Perhaps if Tankard-Reist changed tacks and
  encouraged Harradine to stop trying - in line with his religious
  commitments - to derail, defund and legally harass such clinics, there
  would be fewer sorrowful women needing their stories told in the first
  place.

  HOW DOES this generation define a transcendent relationship, a perfect
  twosome, the ultimate love? In his construction of the relationship
  between Gen-X FBI agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder, the Australian-born
  creator of The X-Files, Chris Carter, has taken a leaf from the
  Victorian era, and added a distinctive 21st-century twist.
  
  Since the start of The X-Files, Carter has insisted there would be no
  shagging between the two agents, despite studio pressure for what he
  derisively refers to as a \`\`David and Maddy‘’ thing. Carter’s reason?
  He wanted their relationship to be \`\`more interesting’’ than that.
  
  But what could be more interesting than shagging? Throughout the early
  days of the series, before all my energy went into staying on top of the
  conspiracy sub-plot, I yearned for the agents to consummate their
  relationship. Judging from X-Files Internet bulletin boards and chatroom
  buzz, I was far from alone. Neither character was with anyone else, at
  least not for long, and each death-defying adventure tested and
  confirmed the soundness of their trust in one another in a world
  increasingly exposed as irrational and conspiracy-ridden. They were
  clearly falling in love; why didn’t they just go to bed?
  
  Of course, Carter is not the first to explore the possibilities of
  platonic love. Indeed, it is only in the past hundred or so years that
  Western societies have seriously entertained the possibility of
  combining true love, sexual desire and the business of marriage all in
  one relationship. Before this, the person with whom one was passionately
  \`\`in love‘’ was rarely either the person one desperately wanted to
  shag or to shack up with domestically. While spousal pairs saw to the
  business of running a household and creating and raising children, messy
  and unpredictable sexual passions were the province of the lover. True
  love was typically reserved for a special or \`\`sentimental’’ friend of
  the same gender.
  
  This was not only because it was believed that sexual passions were
  ephemeral and, thus, inappropriate in any relationship in which
  stability was required, but also because the meeting of mind and spirit
  characteristic of true love was unlikely to take place between members
  of the opposite sex. Upper-class men and women were raised and educated
  separately and lived their lives in separate \`\`spheres’’. Not only did
  they have little in common, they also were raised to profoundly distrust
  one another. Men were encouraged to think of women as their intellectual
  inferiors.
  
  Scully and Mulder are also very different. In an inversion of the usual
  stereotype, Scully is the rational medical scientist, and Mulder the
  instinct-driven paranormal expert. However, because their relationship
  is grounded in trust, intellectual respect and their shared search for
  \`\`the truth’’, these differences are seen to draw the pair closer and
  enrich the meaning of their journey together, rather than estrange them.
  Indeed, it is the rock-solid nature of their trust - a trust that
  contrasts strongly with their attitude to the rest of the world - that
  is the basis of their transcendent love. In my dreams, Mulder tells
  Scully, you were the only one who told me the truth. Even when my world
  was falling apart, you were my constant, my touchstone.
  
  With these words, I felt my fervent desire to see them fall into bed
  together evaporate. They could; they didn’t have to; who cared? Where
  else could sex take them that they hadn’t already been?
  
  Two episodes later, having realised they no longer needed to avoid sex
  because of the Victorian fear - couched in modern-day lingo - of
  \`\`screwing up the relationship‘’, Scully and Mulder kiss. It happens
  right after they have successfully vanquished a millennium cult and are
  watching the ball descend in Times Square on television. Then they smile
  at one another. \`\`The world didn’t end,’’ Mulder mumbles. \`\`No, it
  didn’t,’’ Scully replies. And, with their arms around one another, they
  head down the hall to begin the New Year.
  
  Scully and Mulder are Gen-Xers engaged in the quintessential
  21st-century relationship - it takes place at work, is based in trust,
  respectful of intellectual difference and shag-neutral. Such a prototype
  should be unsurprising for a generation whose youthful reality, unlike
  those who came immediately before, included venereal diseases that kill
  and increasing amounts of time spent in cyberspace, where the nature of
  sex - among other things - is constantly evolving.
  
  So maybe this couple will shag and maybe they won’t. The important thing
  is that their relationship neither needs sex, nor needs sex kept out of
  it. This love is other than that.

  A woman-centred approach to birth includes the right to choose drugs.
  
  CHILDBIRTH was the most painful experience of my life. I did it both
  times without any pain relief beyond nitrous oxide gas, but only the
  first time was by choice. The second time, had I been able to choose, I
  would have had an epidural, or at least some pethidine or morphine.
  
  I didn’t have a choice because I was cared for exclusively by midwives
  in a birth centre. I liked the birth centre, and I liked laboring under
  the care of midwives who had looked after me during my pregnancy.
  Because I didn’t regard either of my low-risk pregnancies as illnesses,
  I felt there was no reason for my labor to be overseen by doctors in a
  hospital ward.
  
  But while the birth centre I attended, like most in Australia, had
  \`\`standing orders’’ to provide me with gas, I had to reconsider my
  options when I wanted more serious painkillers. I could remain at the
  birth centre under the care of the midwives I knew and trusted - and
  accept what I saw as unacceptable amounts of pain - or I could transfer
  to a hospital ward and into the primary care of doctors I didn’t know,
  in order to get the pain relief I wanted. Some choice!
  
  While most Victorian women labor under the care of midwives, only a tiny
  percentage have midwives as their primary carers.
  
  A recent national report has called for resources to be made available
  to address the unmet demand for birth centres in every state. In
  addition, doctors will face increasing pressure to allow midwives to
  assume the status of primary carer for all women having normal, low-risk
  births.
  
  One of the reasons doctors are under pressure to cede more of the
  responsibility for normal births to midwives is because of what the
  World Health Organisation considers unacceptably high levels of
  intervention in births, where the doctor calls the shots.
  
  WHO believes 85 per cent of women should give birth without any
  intervention, Australian women have a significantly higher intervention
  rate.
  
  Opposition to intervention in normal births has come from a number of
  groups. One such group is a coalition of midwives and mothers and forms
  part of what is known as the \`\`natural childbirth movement’’.
  
  Historically, this movement’s embrace of intervention-free birth and
  exclusive breastfeeding as \`\`natural" and \`\`best for baby’’ has been
  part of an overall belief in the natural capacity of women to give birth
  to, feed and care for children.
  
  These beliefs support a view that in most cases pain relief, like most
  birth interventions, is unnatural and unnecessary, damaging for the baby
  and can possibly disrupt the natural bonding process that occurs at
  birth.
  
  Feminists are longstanding - though strange - bedfellows of the natural
  childbirth movement. Feminists also seek less medical intervention in
  childbirth, but their objection to intervention is that it strips women
  of their \`\`control’’ of the birth process.
  
  Many feminists are unsupportive of pharmacological pain relief because
  it deprives women of an \`\`active‘’ and \`\`conscious’’ birth and is
  the tool of the enemy - the medical profession that usurped the control
  female healers and midwives once had over birth.
  
  Of course, both groups have practical and ideological reasons for their
  less than enthusiastic stance on pain-relief drugs. The reality is that
  the current range of pain-relief drugs can disrupt a woman’s labor,
  leading to a \`\`cascade’’ of unwanted interventions such as a drip to
  get things moving again, a baby suffering respiratory distress and/or a
  forceps or caesarean delivery.
  
  But having defined a woman-centred/feminist birth as free from
  pharmacological pain relief, both natural childbirth advocates and
  feminists tend to minimise the pain of labor by employing euphemisms
  such as \`\`intensity’’, and exaggerate the efficacy of the
  non-pharmacological forms of pain relief such as baths and massages, or
  both.
  
  While I can see how this happened, I can’t support it. Any group batting
  for women must accept that some of us want a less interventionist and
  more woman-centred birth, and the best pain-relieving drugs money can
  buy.
  
  Not only should natural childbirth advocates and feminists fight for the
  right to dispense such drugs to informed and consenting women, they
  should put their considerable skills and energies into fighting for a
  better choice of pain relief than what is now available.
  
  Although I would have taken what was on offer, my real choice would have
  been a drug that effectively managed my pain, but also had a negligible
  impact both on my foetus and the course of my labor.
  
  Pain is not noble, and it is not \`\`intensity’’. It is pain, and it
  sucks. Women should be given a choice about the sort of pain relief they
  want.
  
  If they decide to have drugs, they should have the right for the drugs
  to be delivered by the carer of their choice - be it a midwife or a
  doctor. Those who want to take the pharmacological option need a wider
  range of choices than those currently available.
  
  A woman-centred approach to birth is about expanding women’s rights and
  choices, and having effective pain-relieving drugs during labor is as
  legitimate a choice as any other.

  BREASTFEEDING: what could be more simple? Best for mother, best for
  baby, the obvious and necessary feeding choice for all mums, and the
  only one ethical health professionals can support. Most women reading
  this would find such "facts’’ familiar.
  
  The gut-wrenching feelings of guilt and inadequacy that accompany such
  pronouncements might also feel familiar. Because when it comes to
  breastfeeding, most of us feel like failures: either because we didn’t
  try to or didn’t succeed at breast-feeding our babies, or we fear we
  didn’t feed for long enough.
  
  Women are consistently told that the nutritional superiority of breast
  milk makes breastfeeding the only \`\`choice‘’ for any mother who really
  cares about her baby. To ensure the maximum number of women \`\`choose’’
  breastfeeding, public health officials, health professionals and
  breastfeeding advocates see themselves as justified in doing whatever it
  takes to \`\`support‘’ breastfeeding and to \`\`actively discourage’’
  formula feeding.
  
  Women may decide not to initiate or to continue breastfeeding for a
  range of reasons. They may not feel comfortable exposing their breast in
  public, they may \`\`fail’’ because of supply problems or mastitis, or
  they may have had enough after three or four months and want to hand
  over primary care to Dad.
  
  The bar that today’s \`\`successful‘’ breastfeeders must leap is
  considerably higher than that needing to be vaulted by previous
  generations. Twenty years ago, breastfeeding was recommended for three
  months. Soon after target was set at six months. Now the World Health
  Organisation says all women (regardless of where they live and the
  adequacy of alternative food supplies) should breastfeed \`\`into the
  second year and beyond’’. Accordingly, many Australian researchers have
  begun pushing the government to adopt one-year targets.
  
  The benefits claimed for breastfeeding are also on the rise, although
  advocates consistently fail to disclose the significant controversies
  among researchers about whether such benefits exist and whether they are
  caused (or just correlated) with breastfeeding. Selective reporting of
  research findings is also rife.
  
  My favorite is a recent study that showed that while breastfeeding
  lowered breast cancer rates in pre-menopausal women, it appeared to
  raise the incidence of breast cancer in post-menopausal women. You’ll
  find the former finding in the fact sheets distributed by the La Leche
  League; the latter is strangely absent.
  
  But the biggest problem is that breastfeeding advocates confuse
  decisions about breast milk with decisions about breastfeeding. Even
  women who have no doubts that breast milk is nutritionally superior to
  formula may make an informed and caring decision that, in their
  situation, breastfeeding is not the best choice.
  
  This is because women don’t base infant-feeding decisions only on the
  respective qualities of the milk, but also on the costs and benefits of
  each feeding method to their infant, their other children, themselves,
  their partners and their family as a whole. For example, a woman may
  weigh up the \`\`risk’’ to her infant of giving some formula at three
  months so she can return to her full-time job, against that of losing
  her job altogether or falling out of the loop because of the extensive
  amount of time needed during the work day to express milk. Not only
  might the woman value her job as an important source of self-esteem and
  financial independence, her income may be essential to the family’s
  meeting its commitments to a mortgage or private school.
  
  When a woman makes a decision according to her own values about how she
  is going to feed her infant, this decision merits support and respect
  regardless of what it is. For this to happen, a number of policies,
  practices and attitudes are going to need to change.
  
  The first is the accuracy of the information disseminated to women about
  breast and formula feeding. Such information needs to distinguish
  between infant milk (breast and formula) and infant-feeding decisions.
  It must also either reveal all the confusing and contradictory findings
  and debates about the relative merits of breast milk and formula, or
  report only those findings about which there is little disagreement.
  
  There also needs to be changes in workplace structure and attitudes to
  enable women who want to breastfeed to do so for as long as they wish
  without fear of losing their job. Extended paid parental leave is the
  most critical of these, but proper workplace facilities in which women
  can take adequate nursing breaks during the day are also important.
  
  But such changes do not mean all women will choose to initiate
  breastfeeding or to feed for extended periods of time. Health officials
  and professionals who believe it would be unethical to support anything
  but breastfeeding must seriously rethink the meaning of ethical and
  professional behavior when it comes to caring for new mothers. It is
  unethical for health professionals to use their considerable power and
  authority to coerce (subtly or otherwise) competent and informed women
  to make decisions that accord with the health professional’s view of
  what is right.
  
  It is even more unethical for such professionals to refuse to respect,
  to withdraw support from, or seek to undermine women’s decisions they
  deem \`\`wrong’’. Their moral and professional responsibility is to help
  women understand the information women see as relevant to their
  decision, and then to respect women’s capacity as competent informed
  adults to make the best decision for them.
  
  Ah, respect for female autonomy and moral agency. What could be more
  simple?

  She is pushed to have all the tests, then damned if she terminate late
  
  Abortion is in the criminal code in many states in Australia, including
  the state of Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital. However, in
  1969 the state court ruled that abortion was defensible if the doctor
  honestly believed on reasonable grounds that it was necessary to
  preserve the woman’s physical or mental health. While this judgements
  has resulted in Victorian women having good access to safe termination
  services early in pregnancy, it also clearly established abortion as a
  medical prerogative, not a woman’s “choice,” or “right.” Indeed, after
  the story of the 32-week abortion was leaked to the press, the Royal
  Women’s quickly established an inquiry to reassure the public that they
  would be assessing the reasons doctors had for performing the
  termination.
  
  News reports of the complex case at the Royal Women’s - about which
  nothing has been heard from the woman herself - have focused less on the
  legal aspects of the case, and more on the ethical issues usually seen
  to surround late-term abortions: the late gestational age of the fetus
  and the seriousness of its predicted disability. While only 5 per cent
  of terminations are performed after 14 weeks, around half of these are
  done because of potential damage to the fetus.
  
  My research suggests that while most women see abortion as a moral
  issue, they nominate different ethical concerns to the masculinist ones
  mainstream academics and journalists glibly presume to be at issue. Such
  views equate “viable” fetuses with babies born, and consequently reduce
  pregnancy to an issue of “fetal location.”
  
  Women, not surprisingly, see the relationship between mother and fetus
  as meaningful and at the heart of the moral issues that surround
  abortion. Many see the pregnant woman as morally obliged to commit as
  early as possible either to gestating the fetus and raising the child
  that results, or to obtaining a termination.
  
  The Royal Women’s case demonstrates how social and medical attitudes and
  practices surrounding pregnancy may, by imposing alternative ethical
  requirements on pregnant women, alienate them from their own intuitive
  understanding of the range and limits of the moral obligations that
  arise from the “pregnant relationship:” the evolving relationship
  between the pregnant woman and her fetus.
  
  During pregnancy a woman is becoming a mother, a process she completes
  when the child is born. At the center of this becoming is her evolving
  relationship with her fetus. For most women this relationship is
  initially only known, not felt (“The line in the box on the stick says I
  am pregnant but I don’t feel anything.”), but it comes to occupy the
  center of her thoughts, dreams, hopes and body by the time the baby is
  due. Most women increasingly come to love the fetus inside them as it
  progressively makes its presence felt in her body and life. As time goes
  on, they grow eager for the baby to emerge from their bodies, where they
  will “consummate” the relationship begun in-utero, through sight, smell,
  touch and nurture.
  
  The existence and practice of antenatal screening imposes other ethical
  imperatives on women, while the limitations of the screens may hinder
  the normal development of the relationship between mother and fetus.
  
  Ethicist Paul Laurtizen believes the mere existence of medical
  technology can compel people to “choose” it. In other words, if a woman
  does not choose to have a pre-natal screen and she gives birth to a
  disabled child, some will see her as having chosen to have a child with
  a disability (and therefore as solely responsible for the social and
  financial costs of its care).
  
  The vast majority of doctors are enthusiastic supporters of antenatal
  screening. They assume women do and should choose these tests only when
  they are willing to terminate a fetus with a disability, and many expect
  and encourage women to choose termination when test results are
  “negative.”
  
  This enthusiasm takes place against a backdrop of social
  indifference~~~~some would say antagonism~~~~towards people with
  disabilities.
  
  However, some antenatal tests, such as the one for dwarfism, can only be
  performed very late in pregnancy.
  
  These pressures put women in a bind. They are seen as morally
  irresponsible if they decide against screening, or refuse to terminate
  an anomalous fetus, but are castigated as callous and unmaternal if they
  do decide to terminate a disabled fetus late in pregnancy. In addition,
  the pressure to screen and terminate runs counter to the attachment and
  commitment many women feel and believe they should feel to their fetus.
  
  Some may seek to resolve these dilemmas by holding off coming to know,
  love and commit to the fetus inside them until they have been given the
  medical “all-clear.” Remaining “tentative” about their pregnancy, to use
  ethicist Barbara Rothman’s phrase, may be a woman’s best way of
  protecting herself emotionally as she tries to negotiate the
  contradictory moral demands imposed on her by the medical profession and
  society.
  
  Some have argued that the Royal Women’s Hospital case demonstrates the
  ethical burdens faced by the medical profession and the urgent need for
  law reform. I would argue that what this case mostly demonstrates is the
  untenable moral and practical burdens imposed on pregnant women in
  Australian society.
  
  As the technological management of pregnancy increases and the tools in
  the medical armory expand, women are faced with increasingly difficult
  and intensely personal moral decisions, and increasingly harsh social
  judgments of the way they make them—no matter what they choose.
  
  Greater respect for women’s moral agency and support of their struggle
  to make moral choices that make practical sense in an increasingly
  complex and constraining world are desperately needed.
  
  Reforming the law to put the choice in women’s capable hands is only a
  start.

  Dated views about women and work are deservedly dying out.
  
  What’s happening in cultural politics? All we find out is filtered
  through the eyes and ears of people whose formative experiences occurred
  at least 20 years ago. They seem to have grown conservative and dull,
  and are frightened of new ideas. A gulf has opened between what they are
  saying and what younger people are thinking.
  
  Mark Davis, Gangland (Allen & Unwin, 1997)
  
  \`\`WHY don’t they all shut up already?’’ wonders a friend as the papers
  erupt again with the familiar anti-working woman/anti-child-care
  diatribes of the previous generation. While the impetus for these
  flare-ups varies, the parameters and content of the debate never change.
  
  The same old questions about women, work and the care of children are
  being asked and answered by the same old people: ageing baby-boom
  journalists and academics who raised their young families in the 1970s
  and ‘80s on the basis of advice they received from the child-development
  \`\`experts’’ of the ’50s.
  
  These child-care dinosaurs share a number of assumptions and values.
  They assume that the care middle-class mothers give their kids is the
  \`\`gold standard‘’ and thus all middle-class mothers should provide all
  of the care for their children, especially those under five. Because
  mothers \`\`should’’ be caring for their children, dinosaur thinking
  proceeds, they are the ones that \`\`leave them‘’ in child care and are
  consequently responsible for the \`\`consequences’’.
  
  These assumptions and values lead the dinosaurs to keep asking the same
  questions they’ve been asking since the late 1960s: should women/mothers
  work?
  
  Of course, back in the 21st century, few members of Gen X and Gen Y -
  those currently considering parenthood or raising young children - can
  relate to these assumptions and values, or the questions they generate.
  As recent large-scale, longitudinal studies of Australian women and my
  own research demonstrate, younger women assume the role of work in their
  life and value paid employment as an important source of identity and
  independence.
  
  In contrast with their baby-boomer predecessors, increasing numbers of
  young men are comfortable with women’s educational achievements and
  supportive of their career aspirations. For most of them, the question
  \`\`should women/mothers work?’’ is laughable and the assumption that
  only a child’s mother is capable of providing excellent care is dubious.
  
  Indeed, recent evidence suggests a considerable number of young men,
  possibly up to a third, want to be and believe they should be active
  fathers: sharing the work of breadwinning and the hands-on work of
  caring for children with their partners. In such relationships, both
  parents make, and share responsibility for, decisions to share the care
  of their children with one another and with granny and/or a paid carer.
  
  Because many Gen Xers and Yers assume both parents do and should engage
  in paid employment and share responsibility for child care, the
  questions they’d like to see asked and answered revolve around the
  proper division of work and care responsibilities. How should parents
  divide these tasks between themselves? What role should the state and/or
  employers play in sharing the responsibility for children, either
  directly or through policies and practices that help parents balance
  work and family responsibilities?
  
  Such debates are not without precedent. Indeed, countries (such as Swede
  and the GDR) that assume - rather than contest - women’s involvement in
  paid employment ask them regularly, although the answers vary
  considerably.
  
  While the child-care dinosaurs have and will continue to strangle such
  debates, their reign is nearly over. The boomers, those propagating the
  current paradigm and those buying into it, are ageing. In seven to 10
  years, the last of their kids will have fled the nest and concerns about
  superannuation, aged-care beds and pensioner concessions will be
  uppermost in their minds.
  
  It is simply inconceivable that a generation on the cusp of retirement,
  clutching dog-eared copies of W.D.Winnicott’s 1957 tome on child
  development, will continue to muster authority in debates about the
  having and raising of young children. Not just because their ideologies
  are so far past their use-by date, but because many in the coming
  generation of prospective and actual parents will have spent a fair bit
  of their childhood in centre-based care or the care of someone other
  than their mothers. They simply won’t be vulnerable in the same way as
  were their parents to dinosaur scare-mongering about the damage caused
  to kids by non-maternal care.
  
  My advice to those of the current generation and the next, who have been
  alternately aggravated and bored by the latest rounds of the child-care
  \`\`debate’’, is to hang in there: we are listening to the death throes
  of the child-care dinosaurs.
  
  Don’t expect it to be quick or quiet. Surely the dying of the giant
  lizards rarely was. But be prepared with questions, ideas and solutions
  for when all has finally gone quiet. The debate has ossified for far too
  long; we’ve got a lot of work to do.

  Women don’t turn to IVF lightly. Men are fleeing fatherhood.
  
  HAS anybody listened to what Lisa Meldrum is - and is not - saying about
  her decision to pursue sole motherhood using donor sperm? She notes:
  \`\`All young girls dream of a husband, a house and a family, but it’s
  just not the way it is for everybody and it wasn’t that way for me. And
  this is what it has come to.’’
  
  Meldrum is not alone. Research suggests that while most women who expect
  to mother but wind up childless come to accept and enjoy life without
  children, a small number are unable to relinquish their dream of
  motherhood. In my study of circumstantially childless women, this small
  group wants \`\`the whole package’’: marriage and motherhood. But,
  having failed to find a partner, or one willing to have children, these
  women despair of giving up their dream of motherhood too.
  
  Such women have thought long and hard about whether they can be
  \`\`good’’ mothers raising a child alone. They’ve considered male role
  models and time and financial management issues. They’ve anguished over
  the sort of relationship they feel is important for their child to have
  with their biological father, and how to provide it.
  
  Several women I know ultimately decided against sole motherhood because
  they wanted their child to have a relationship with the biological
  father, and couldn’t find a man willing to donate sperm, or to do so
  with a willingness to have a continuing relationship with the child.
  Women who push ahead with their plans to mother do so because they
  believe they have found good solutions to what they accept are vital
  issues facing mothers and children born from donor sperm.
  
  While the controversy has been depicted as a battle of rights, \`\`moral
  panic’’ would be a far more accurate description. At the core of our
  anxiety is the growing social and economic autonomy of women, and the
  declining role of men in the formation of families.
  
  Earlier this week a conservative commentator lambasted Meldrum and other
  single women for the \`\`me, me’’ nature of their desire to mother. The
  charge is that women’s new control of sometimes considerable resources
  has turned them from their rightful 1950s role as promoters of the
  interests and desires of others: men and children.
  
  At the heart of this panic is the subconscious realisation that it has
  always been women’s economic dependency - not their naturally selfless
  natures - that led them to accept social roles that relegated them to
  being means to other people’s ends.
  
  Even more anxiety-producing is the (mistaken) belief that what Meldrum
  was asserting in her court action - and what the court was affirming in
  its decision - was that men are unnecessary in the important business of
  forming families. The worry is that women’s economic independence and
  advances in reproductive technologies have led increasing numbers of
  women to conclude that men (as people, not sperm donors) are incidental
  to the having and raising of kids.
  
  But while the evidence clearly shows that most women want men to be real
  players in the family, it also suggests a gap between what women expect
  from male partners, and what men are willing and able to provide.
  Because middle-class women no longer have to marry for money, they are
  increasingly rejecting men unable or unwilling to provide them with
  emotional companionship and to share the domestic load. There is growing
  evidence that increasing numbers of men would prefer a new car to a new
  baby, and up to one-third may be reluctant or unwilling to undertake the
  commitments of a stable relationship, little less those of fatherhood.
  
  What all this suggests is that as women have become choosier about their
  life partners, fewer men are even putting their hands up for the job.
  
  This tension - between what women want and what men can and want to
  provide - is at the heart of the current debate. We must resist the
  Canberra-led charge to arrest our anxiety by taking pot shots at sole
  mothers, and search instead for the more lasting calm that comes from
  finding solutions to the right questions.

  Feminists expect fathers to do domestic work, so how can they tacitly
  exempt mothers from paid work?
  
  THIS is how I remember a conversation last week between me and two other
  mothers of grade 1 children:
  
  Mother 1: Does your child sleep at night?
  
  Me: Yes, why? Doesn’t yours?
  
  Mother 1: She gets up two or three times a night.
  
  Me: I think it’s because I did some “controlled comfort” with him when
  he was little; it teaches them how to put themselves back to sleep when
  they wake up.
  
  Mother 2: I think “controlled comfort” is barbaric.
  
  Mother 1: Well, I’m just exhausted.
  
  Mother 2: Me too. Actually, half the time she sleeps in my bed. That’s
  why I could never get a job. I’m too exhausted: motherhood is my
  full-time job.
  
  Is it really barbaric to set limits for your children? To expect them
  to, say, put themselves to sleep and to sleep in their own bed? Or is it
  simply weak and self-indulgent to refuse to draw the line, and to
  characterise this refusal as evidence of maternal love and dedication?
  
  This is not an idle question (although I am sure some of you are wishing
  I’d left it idling). Rather, it is an explosive issue that the women’s
  movement has long sought to stifle with the rhetoric of “choice”. So
  while feminists have long struggled to enshrine all women’s social
  freedom and legal right to work, regardless of whether they are married
  and/or mothers, most have argued that the decision to engage in paid
  work or to make motherhood a full-time job is a woman’s prerogative.
  
  But which mothers exercise this prerogative? Not working-class married
  ones whose wage is the only thing that keeps the family income above the
  poverty line. And not, since the most recent federal budget, the single
  woman of school-age children whose mutual obligation to society now
  demands she enter the workforce, or be in the process of becoming
  “job-ready”.
  
  No, the opportunity of making motherhood a long-term job is available
  only to women who are either independently wealthy or whose husbands’
  salaries push them safely into the “middle class”. Only middle-class
  women are socially lauded as “good” mothers for refusing to engage in
  paid work, while working-class women doing the same thing are labelled
  “unemployed” or - if receiving benefits - “dole bludgers”.
  
  So are unemployed middle-class women of older children really “good”
  mothers or are they women unable to enter the workforce - at least at
  the level they would be forced to start back on, having spent so many
  years out of the workforce? For those with minimal education or job
  experience, the former may be the case; the latter is extremely likely
  for the remainder, given inadequate maternity leave provisions and a
  lack of career-track part-time employment and guaranteed re-entry at
  exit level of seniority.
  
  Here’s some more anecdotal evidence. All the women I know who remained
  out of the workforce until two or more children reached school age found
  it extremely difficult to get back in at all, or at a level commensurate
  with their skills. All felt that employers wanted to know what they were
  doing all that time and considered the answer - raising children -
  inadequate, particularly once the children they were talking about were
  older than two.
  
  Some of these women bit the bullet and took whatever work they could
  get, often finding that, once in, they progressed quickly through the
  ranks - although none are back where they would be had they never left.
  Others got angry, disillusioned, scared (or all of the above) and either
  got pregnant again, or started talking up - as per mother 2 above - the
  strenuous demands of mothering school-age children.
  
  Indeed some, once they saw the job-opportunity writing on the wall,
  worked hard to make those demands more strenuous. It’s amazing how
  demanding children can become when their every need and desire for a
  mother’s time and energy is indulged.
  
  Feminists must get off the fence and argue - without the classist waffle
  of “choice” - that all women have a right to, and should engage in, paid
  work once their children are out of nappies, or not long after. Without
  paid employment, women lack social identity, social status and social
  freedom. From the woman who feels ignored at the cocktail party once she
  reveals her long-term maternal role, to the victim of domestic violence
  lacking the means to take her kids and flee, paid work gives women
  things long-term motherhood never can or will.
  
  And in the same way feminists insist it is men’s moral and social
  responsibility - not prerogative - to share domestic work, so must we
  insist women have an obligation to share the work of bringing home the
  bacon. The best and most equitable way for this to be done is for both
  partners to work part-time.
  
  Indeed, once all women with older children engage in paid work, few are
  likely to find it barbaric to set boundaries and limits for their
  children. This is because they will no longer rely on the endless amount
  of maternal work, generated by a lack of boundaries and limits, to
  justify their lack of paid employment.
  
  Motherhood will become as fatherhood is now: just one of the
  responsibilities that women undertake in the course of busy lives, not
  the only one.

  By Anne Summers, Random House Australia, 2003. Paperback RRP $29.95
  
  TEASE: Who better than Anne Summers, a woman who lists among her
  achievements the best-selling book Damned Whores and God’s Police,
  advisor to former Prime Minister Keating and Officer of the Order of
  Australia for services to journalism and women, to write about the most
  pressing social problem of our time: the tragic imbalance between work
  and family responsibilities, and the devastating impact it is having on
  women’s well-being and the nation’s capacity to reproduce itself?
  
  Heaven knows there has been no shortage of column inches dedicated to
  the problem, as well as diligent hand-wringing and sympathetic clucking
  noises from the Howard government. Yet while the problem seems to worsen
  almost hourly, the Government does nothing. The reason for this, Summers
  explains, is that the Government’s ideological preference for
  traditional family arrangements - where Daddy brings home the bacon and
  Mum cares for house and kids - precludes it from implementing policies
  designed to reduce working women’s stress.
  
  To the contrary, this bias leads the Government to blatantly
  discriminate against families where both parents work by viciously
  underfunding childcare, and implementing tax and benefit policies that
  leave families with two earner $75 a week worse off on average than
  those with only one. Summers argues that Australian women are often
  unaware of such discriminatory policies because of the government’s
  decision to either eliminate or enfeeble the agencies that in the past
  not only would have publicly argued against them, bout kept ongoing tabs
  on the impact they were having on women’s equality.
  
  Close to forty years on the political stage has done nothing to taint or
  muffle Summers’ activist indignation and thirsting for justice. She is
  not afraid to name names in her expansive discussion of how both Labour
  and Liberal politicians have failed women, as well as tossing bouquets
  at the few men - Victorian QC Chris Maxwell comes in for special mention
  - who use their power and influence to pursue justice for women. Given
  that she was amongst the band of optimistic second-wave feminists who
  confidently predicted that the mere presence of more women in Canberra
  would make a difference, I particularly admired her willingness to
  express disappointment in the 60 female members and senators who now
  comprise over a quarter of pollies on the Federal benches for failing to
  agitate on behalf of women. Emily’s List (the Labour women’s
  organization that funds progressive female candidates) rightly comes in
  for particular scrutiny for its inability - despite requiring all the
  candidates it funds to demonstrate that they are pro-choice and
  pro-childcare - to “galvanise” women to act on these commitments once
  elected.
  
  Throughout the book, Summers reveals herself to be a woman who doesn’t
  just get mad, but gets active. She writes unselfconsciously (as if
  everyone leaps into constructive action when their fundamental values
  are challenged) about her outrage at Prime Minister Howard’s failure to
  appoint a female Governor General, and his subsequent leaking to the
  media that he desired to do so (leaving the clear impression that there
  wasn’t a single woman in the country who was qualified). Grabbing a copy
  of Who’s Who, it took Summers less than an hour to come up with 45 names
  of women who were more than qualified for the post.
  
  I must admit to being somewhat disappointed by the analysis Summers
  provides of the causes of - and cures for - the work/family crunch and
  resultant “fertility strike.” Unlike her discussion of violence and the
  subterranean but highly politically sophisticated way in which the
  Howard government has “disappeared” women from the political agenda -
  where she clearly knows her way well around the factual and conceptual
  terrain - she consistently fails to call on the intellectual apparatus
  needed to make sense of the varied and complex things women want, do and
  settle for when it comes to work and family. There is no doubt this
  areas is complicated, with seeming contradictions at every turn. What to
  make, for instance, of repeated surveys that show that young Australian
  women are as committed as young men to the paid workforce (to remaining
  “attached” to it and progressing up the career ladder), but others that
  reveal substantial numbers of women claiming to “choose” total
  withdrawal from the paid workforce or insecure part-time non-career
  related jobs when they become mothers? “Constrained choice” and the
  meaning of being a “non-chooser” in liberal democratic societies like
  Australia are just some of the concepts found in thoughtful feminist
  analysis of women’s work/life decisions that would have assisted Summers
  to both explain such trends, and point the way ahead.
  
  But if you’ve got a pulse and care about justice for women, you’re sure
  to finish the book itching to do something - anything - to catapult
  women’s quest for equality back on to the national agenda. Wisely,
  Summers is prepared, dedicating her final chapter to a list of “ten ways
  to change the world” and a directory of the relevant organizations and
  individuals to contact to make your displeasure known. Since going to
  press, she has even put this information up on her new website
  (annesummers.com.au) where - with the aid of hyperlinks - it is even
  easier to get started.
  
  “Don’t get mad,” Summers advises, “get justice.” The rest she knows, is
  up to us.

  USUALLY he amazes, but this time we were appalled.
  
  That’s because this time, when Steve Irwin stepped into the arena at his
  Sunshine Coast wildlife park and used one hand to feed a dead chicken to
  a 4m crocodile named Murray, clutched in the other was his tiny
  one-month-old son, Robert.
  
  For some, the hubbub that followed is a whole lot of fuss about nothing.
  Why call the child protection authorities or threaten Irwin’s nomination
  for Australian of the Year? The man is an expert and knew exactly what
  he was doing.
  
  Irwin himself agrees. “I was in complete control,” he insisted at a news
  conference the day after the incident. In complete control? Come on,
  whoever is?
  
  And that is precisely the point.
  
  The reason Irwin has found himself on the sharp end of so much
  finger-pointing is that his behaviour provides us an opportunity - as a
  society — to trumpet to the rooftops our collective values and standards
  about the right way to raise kids.
  
  What we Australians tend to believe (rightly, in my view) is that
  regardless of how much risk Irwin was actually putting his young son at,
  any risk at all ~~- if it is avoidable~~- is too much when it comes to
  children. Particularly children that are so young that not only do they
  lack any capacity to defend themselves, but even to express their
  feelings or desires about what is happening to them.
  
  Far from being petty or over the top, the chatter of disapproval
  surrounding Irwin’s decision to make his young son part of the show
  serves an important social purpose: constructing and then reinforcing
  our collective moral beliefs about how parents should - and should not -
  behave.
  
  But beneath such values talk lurks something more sinister. A belief, or
  perhaps just a suspicion, that men simply lack what it takes to be good
  parents to young children.
  
  Like Michael Jackson, who just over a year ago became embroiled in a
  similar controversy when he dangled his infant over a hotel balcony,
  Irwin comes across as a man of his generation: a loving, enthusiastic
  and seemingly hands-on father.
  
  But this may be the problem, because the behaviour of both superstars
  seems to have unearthed longstanding beliefs that, when it comes to
  looking after infants fathers just don’t have what it takes.
  
  They are simply too noisy, too rough, too danger loving - in a word, too
  unwomanly - to provide the gentle care and tender nurture that young
  children need to thrive and to survive.\
  This is mostly rubbish, though like all lies it does contain a grain of
  truth.
  
  And that is that while fathers are more than capable of caring properly
  for children of all ages, they will not parent in the same way as
  mothers. While there is no doubt that modern-day fathers are still
  feeling their way towards a child-rearing style that is uniquely their
  own - and that getting the precise formula right may take time - it is a
  certainty that as long as men are less risk-averse than women, fathers
  will raise their children in more thrill-filled ways than do mothers.
  
  And while dangling kids near crocodiles and over railings is extreme and
  should be ruled out of bounds, I feel confident in saying that exposure
  to the different parenting styles of both genders won’t damage kids.
  
  It may even do them good. For in observing - early on and on a
  day-to-day basis - the ways mums and dads think, show love, play and
  simply go about the business of getting things done, kids are learning
  the most valuable lesson of all: that in most of the ways that matter,
  women and men are pretty much the same.
  
  But it’s those differences that keep things interesting.

  WE still don’t know exactly what sparked the terrible flurry of violence
  that cost David Hookes his life.
  
  But if early reports are correct, it appears he may have been defending
  the girlfriend of one of his colleagues — a woman who had been abused or
  slighted by someone in another group at the Beaconsfield Hotel.
  
  If this is true, David Hookes lost his life because he was defending
  another’s honour.
  
  Acting, you might say, like a good Samaritan.
  
  The parable of the good Samaritan is usually seen as a biblical lesson
  on the virtue of helping strangers. In fact, the tale - about a
  Samaritan who overlooks the longstanding and deeply felt enmity between
  Samaritans and Israelites to help a Jew in need - contends that earning
  God’s love requires us not just to put ourselves out for strangers, but
  also for mortal foes. But what about loving yourself, or more precisely,
  being able to look at yourself in the mirror? What about making the
  world the kind of place that you, and those you care about, want to live
  in: a place not just to survive, but to thrive?
  
  For some, good Samaritans are fools: naive suckers or idiots lacking
  discretion who will surely, given enough time, get themselves hurt or
  killed.
  
  But I see the Samaritan as righteous, even heroic.
  
  To understand why, you need only picture a world in which neither the
  concept nor reality of the good Samaritan exists. Sadly, this exercise
  doesn’t require imagination, just some historical recollection.
  
  In 1964, Kitty Genovese, a waitress in her late 20s, was murdered on the
  streets of a working-class suburb of Queens while 38 of her neighbours
  listened, looked on, and even discussed among themselves the mayhem
  below, but did nothing to help - not even phone the police. The attack
  lasted for more than 30 minutes, the assailant fleeing and returning
  three times - feeling unsatisfied, he later told the court, that he had
  not finished what he set out to do. During the final phase, the attacker
  used the knife with which he’d been stabbing Genovese to cut off her bra
  and underwear so he could rape her.
  
  Few of Genovese’s neighbours expressed regret for their inaction;
  instead, they justified it by an unwillingness to “get involved”.
  Shocked, in pain and dazed by blood loss, one can only imagine what
  Kitty Genovese felt in the final moments of her life. “Alone” must
  surely have been high on the list.
  
  Genovese’s death offered all New Yorkers a glimpse of what life would
  become - what they would become - in a world without the non-specific
  caring and general decency of good Samaritans. Because when we give to
  another person, not because they are our child or a friend, and not
  because we expect something back, but because they need our help, we
  make that person live and matter in our eyes.
  
  Not only do we dignify them in this way, but we let them know they are
  not alone, and in so doing, reduce our own sense of isolation, too.
  
  Reaching for the good Samaritan in ourselves is about being all we can
  be, instead of the least we can get away with; about moving towards a
  world that trades on love, instead of fearfully shuffling backwards
  towards the abyss.
  
  But regardless of what prompted this week’s tragedy, to many, David
  Hookes is already a hero. One of the paramedics who struggled to revive
  him at the scene said as much.
  
  An inspired player, incisive coach, and straight-shooting commentator,
  his life was too short and unfairly taken. He will be missed.

  The budget will encourage single working women to have children - but
  more needs to be done
  
  Has the budget left the single and childless out in the cold? Speaking
  on our ABC this morning, Peter Costello said, “no.” According to the
  treasurer, the fact that most childless singles will one day form
  families means they will - and know they will - eventually be the
  beneficiaries of handouts to new mothers and couples with kids.
  
  Costello is right, and his claim points to an important and often
  ignored cause of Australia’s plummeting fertility rate. According to my
  research, one of the reasons some women hesitate about having children
  is that they notice the tough time contemporary mothers are having
  balancing work and family, and don’t want to share their pain. To
  continue to behave as though government policy and workplace practices
  only affect today’s parents, instead of the potential parents of
  tomorrow, is both naive and dangerous.
  
  Here’s how it works. A single women works alongside a number of women
  with children, some single mums, others married with partners. Or she’s
  got sisters, cousins or friends who have kids. During lunchbreaks, on
  the phone, at family events, over dinner, these mothers tell their tales
  of trying - and in modern-day Australia - failing to achieve their
  desire to be good parents in happy marriages and, at the same time,
  remain valued employees. Childless women listen to complaints mothers
  make about the costs of childcare, and their worries about its impact on
  their kids. They hear about the arguments mothers have with their blokes
  over who does the drop-offs, washes the clothes, feeds the dog and takes
  the day off when the child is sick. They guiltily observe, as childless
  commentator Sian Prior admitted, mothers being “punished for not staying
  back late in the office” and are aware that their own career advancement
  comes at the expense of these “exhausted but determined” women.
  Childless women hear and watch all this and they think: I want to
  mother, but not like this. And they delay a little longer.
  
  Childless men are also paying attention to what’s going on around them.
  Despite the hype, growing numbers of them are committed, when they
  finally do become fathers, to being “accessible” and intimately involved
  in their child’s life. One survey found that many want to reduce their
  hours when their kids are young. But in a country where growing numbers
  of men are insecurely employed, maternity leave - little less paternity
  leave - remains pie-in-the-sky, and where workers who do less than 40
  (and in some industries 60) hour weeks miss out on promotion and pay
  rises, they know these ambitions have little chance of being fulfilled.
  So they too delay.
  
  How big a helping hand does the budget lend parents and, consequently,
  those considering becoming them? It’s a step in the right direction, but
  unfortunately, still far less than what is needed to considerably
  improve the capacity of parents to simultaneously fulfil their ambitions
  to be both good parents and successful workers. Unfortunately, this
  means it is insufficient to convince the deliberating and planning group
  of potential parents - those I call the Waiters and Watchers - to say
  “yes” to having kids.
  
  What else will be necessary? Men are more likely to take paternity leave
  if it is offered beyond the first year of a child’s life, and a recent
  study from Brown University contends that in families where the father
  shoulders half the burden of the “second shift,” mothers say “yes” to
  more kids. This suggests that if parents were given enough money to fund
  one year of leave at nearly-full pay which they could use until the
  child went to school - the current situation in Norway - they would be
  able to divide the childcare burden between them, while each retained a
  firm foothold in the workplace. This sort of package would give parents
  the option of totally avoiding paid care in the first few years of the
  child’s life if this was their preference, or alternatively combining
  parental and paid childcare across a larger number of years. Of course,
  for such a plan to work, high quality childcare needs to be the norm and
  must become affordable which, at around $50 per day per child, it not
  now the case.
  
  This should, as long as it was coupled with changed social attitudes
  about what “good” mothers and fathers do, new workplace attitudes about
  the “seriousness” of part-time workers, and government guarantees to
  parents that their job, or one at the same level and wages, will be
  waiting for them when they return, would decrease the economic and
  social costs currently born by those raising the next generation.
  
  And, as a result, should lead many of those currently considering
  parenthood to finally take the plunge.

  British filmmaker Julia’s Black’s documentary My Foetus won’t screen in
  Australia until August 8, but debate has already begun about whether the
  film should be censored, and the impact it will have on political debate
  about abortion.
  
  The film, made while Black was pregnant with her first child,
  reconsiders an abortion she had over a decade earlier. It shows a
  four-week pregnant woman having a suction termination, as well as foetal
  remains at 10, 11 and 21 weeks gestation. The filmmaker claims, in an
  article in The Observer, to present both sides of the “reality” of
  abortion: balancing what she describes as “shocking, repulsive, and
  confrontational” images of aborted foetuses with the circumstances and
  emotions of the unhappily pregnant women forced to choose.
  
  There is no question in my mind that My Foetus should be screened. For
  one, it is an unprecedented opportunity for the public to see
  foetal-remains accompanied by accurate captions and commentary. For too
  long, the anti-choice movement has mislabelled images of older fetuses
  as those of 14 weeks gestational age or younger (not coincidentally, the
  period when approximately 95 per cent of abortions take place). For too
  long, the anti-choice movement has used voice-overs in propaganda films
  such as The Silent Scream (in which the ultrasonographic images used are
  so fuzzy and unclear as to be unrecognisable without narrative
  direction) to imply women who abort are heartless and cruel.
  
  More importantly, pro-choice advocates have long seen the foetus as the
  property of the other side: accepting anti-choice claims that if the
  fetus is admitted to be both human and alive, abortion must be
  acknowledged as morally wrong and made illegal - again.
  
  Yet, as fetal imagery becomes increasingly ubiquitous (who amongst us
  hasn’t seen an ultrasound image or an anti-choice billboard?), this
  position has become increasingly politically risky. Black is right to
  feel that the pro-choice movement must reclaim the foetus, though I
  disagree with her assertion that the reason the movement has shied away
  in the past is the “repulsiveness” of foetal remains.
  
  No, the real problem with focusing on the fetus is that it leaves women
  - literally - out of the picture. A typical fetal image is of a
  balled-up cosmonaut in a circular, disembodied capsule. It is rare for
  the line surrounding the fetus to even gesture at its reality as a
  woman’s womb, or to the geographical relationship of the capsule to the
  rest of the woman’s body (is she sitting or standing? In which direction
  are her feet and face?)
  
  More importantly than her body, a focus on the fetus leaves the woman’s
  life out of the picture: her partnership status; her ability to parent
  well; her plans and ambitions for the future. Yet it precisely this
  context, and the way the woman approaches and makes her decision, that
  makes her choice comprehensible, and provides its moral texture and
  meaning.
  
  The anti-choice movement knows this. That is why the “hard cases” -
  unwanted pregnancies resulting from incest and rape, or those that
  threaten a woman’s life - split the movement in two. Because while such
  foetuses are as alive and human as any other, most refuse to condemn
  women who abort in such circumstances. Better than any other, these
  cases show it is our judgements about women’s motives and intentions
  that determine our moral evaluation of her particular abortion. And
  experience shows such judgements to be harsher for strangers, and kinder
  for friends. Abortion clinic staff repeatedly report doing terminations
  for anti-choice protesters, only to find them - weeks later - on the
  picket lines again.
  
  As Black’s film testifies, feeling bad about abortion (or, more
  precisely, feeling bad about finding oneself in the position of having
  to face the decision at all) is testament that our moral sensibilities
  are finely tuned, not that abortion is wrong. Most people who choose
  divorce, particularly those with children, feel less than exultant about
  having to make that decision; yet few believe this proves the choice was
  wrong, or should be legally denied.
  
  Black rarely spoke of her long-ago abortion. Few of the one in three
  women who will have an abortion in their lifetime do. She says she wants
  her film to change that, and the laws that in both the UK and many
  states in Australia that hand doctors ultimate control over whether a
  woman can get an abortion; requiring women “to plead insanity to end an
  unwanted pregnancy.”
  
  The truth is no one knows what the reaction of the Australian public
  will be to the film. But there is no reason why, if Black has done her
  work well - ensuring both women and foetuses remain in the frame - than
  supporters of abortion rights have anything to fear. It is a anti-choice
  myth that women don’t really know what they are doing when they
  terminate, and that seeing foetal remains will reveal some previously
  unrealised “truth” about the procedure.
  
  The morality of abortion is, and will always be, far more complicated
  than that.

  Night Thoughts in a Time of War by Bob Ellis, Viking, 2004.
  
  TEASE: Most people are familiar with at least some of Bob Ellis’s long
  and impressive resume. The author of seventeen books, including the
  bestselling Goodbye Jerusalem, Goodbye Babylon and First Abolish the
  Customer, he’s also written and directed features and documentaries
  including The Notradamus Kid and Bastards from the Bush. He’s won or
  been nominated for numerous honours, including the Premier’s Literary
  Award.
  
  Ellis is also a Labour speechwriter and quintessential leftie insider.
  These days he works for Bob Carr, gets medical referrals from SA Premier
  Mike Rann, and dines with Natasha (“Tash”) Stott-Despoja and her
  (extravagantly wanting, to Ellis’s mind) fiancé, Ian. He has regular
  encounters with political big-wigs who impress him with their, “reason
  and skill” (Kevin Rudd), the “sedate” manner in which they move
  “securely into history” (Whitlam and Graham Freudenberg) or their “rose
  lips” and “dreamy girlish beauty” (Maxine McKew and Stott-Despoja). In
  return, they praise him for getting things “as usual, dead right” (Susie
  Annus), for being “old-fashioned, but in a very, very nice way” (fellow
  speechwriter Carol Green) and by laughing hysterically at his political
  wit (Carr).
  
  Some may find such windows into the personal relationships, intimate
  thoughts and general comings and goings of contemporary power-brokers
  offers welcome relief from the recycled press releases and 20-second
  grabs that now substitutes for current affairs reporting in this
  country. Others may see it as nothing more than name-dropping from an
  aging man preoccupied with his own death and anxious about his own place
  - and the place of the ideas he’s championed all his life - in history.
  
  Make no mistake about it, Ellis is a good guy. He feels for the needy
  and is contemptuous of the greedy, and never fails to use his influence
  to ease the suffering of the most forgotten and abused in Australian
  society. He gave hospitality to Ali Bakhtiyari, the man whose sons fled
  from detention but were refused refuge at the UK Consulate, and vainly
  worked his contacts to prevent the children being shipped back to
  Woomera.
  
  There is also evidence, on numerous occasions, of a fine turn of phrase.
  I love Ellis’s description of taking his two dogs “for a whiffle on the
  beach among the seaweed and the gulls and a town meeting of other
  yelping dogs near the big tree”. With a few deft phrases, his
  description of witnessing an IRA bombing in London back in the 1970s,
  puts us right there.
  
  Yet death confronts us on every page. Ellis admires his mother’s fight
  against her “final descent” and rages against the dying of his own
  personal light. He repeatedly laments the under-appreciation of the
  contributions to politics and culture of dead white men he knew
  personally or admired from history (does he fear a similar fate?), and
  the denial of legitimacy to the varied excuses such men had for failing
  to live up to expectations (as he fears he has?).
  
  For those disinterested in this theme, the text offers little refuge.
  While those who already share Ellis’s world view may take comfort in his
  passionate rehearsal of various left-wing lines (he’s anti-Iraq war,
  anti-Israel, anti-Bush, and pro asylum-seekers), those needing sustained
  and logical argument to be persuaded of the wisdom of Ellis’s assertions
  will be disappointed. His attitude seems to be that you’re either with
  him or a’gin him: if it’s the former you need no persuasion, while those
  in the latter camp will never be convinced, anyway. As a consequence,
  what’s on offer is never weightier than a moment-by-moment recounting of
  recent events surrounding the war in Iraq, accompanied by Ellis’s
  evaluation of whether any particular political action or attempt at spin
  will “play”.
  
  Which leads me to my final reservation about Night Thoughts and all
  books of it’s genre (Noam Chomky’s 9/11, Gore Vidal’s Perpetual War for
  Perpetual Peace): volumes that purport to offer a comprehensive analysis
  of a recent event by “a great thinker of our time”. If journalism is the
  first draft of history, what exactly are such books? They claim to
  provide more than the fact-reporting and superficial analysis
  necessarily characteristic of writing forced to conform to the 24-hour
  news cycle, yet starved of both distance from the event and the
  perspective offered by time, their significance can be doubted. While
  they are almost certainly catering to a book-buying market desperate to
  make sense of our rapidly changing world, I remain sceptical - both in
  theory and from experience- about their capacity to deliver.
  
  A friend currently enjoying Night Thoughts says such criticism misses
  the point. “Ellis is not trying to say anything particularly new or
  insightful. You read it because something big - like the war in Iraq -
  happens and you think to yourself, ‘Now I wonder what a bloke like Ellis
  would think about that?’”.

  The Playboy symbol is enjoying a resurgence in popularity. What does
  this signify?
  
  It’s everywhere. In the smartest shops in Acland Street, and featuring
  in trendy Chapel Street in Prahran. On natty little terry short and the
  smart canvas gym-bag purses that are the currently the pinnacle of
  street-wear chic. The Playboy Bunny logo is back. The question is: what
  does its return mean?
  
  I’m going to nail my colours to the mast here. When I see that Bunny,
  the image that comes to mind are of tall, large-breasted women with
  strap-on fur tails tottering somewhat unsteadily on spike-heels; their
  painted red lips stretched into a fake-looking smile as a diminutive,
  bathrobe-wearing Hugh Hefner snakes his wizened, overly tan arms around
  their waists.
  
  The Bunny logo also makes me think of Gloria Steinem, who was young and
  pretty enough to go undercover as a Bunny Cocktail waitress at the
  Playboy Club in New York City. Though I wasn’t even born when her expose
  of the degrading and oppressive conditions women endured working in this
  supposedly glamorous job appeared in Esquire in 1963, I was impressed
  with her insights - published years later in a collection of essays -
  into the cost of Bunnyhood not just to the minority of women who don
  overlarge pink ears or pose for centrefolds, but to all women who live
  in societies where Bunnyhood is seen as a suitable career aspiration for
  young girls of talent.
  
  This is what the Bunny logo means to me, and perhaps to other
  feminist-minded women and men of my, and more mature, vintages. And this
  is why I won’t buy anything that carries it. But Bunny-stamped items are
  selling well particularly - according to my local shop girl - to women
  in their teens and early twenties. The question is: why?
  
  Perhaps the reason is simple, and actually suggests something quite
  positive. The traditional Playboy model is far more rounded and
  healthy-looking than the under-fed, under-slept female form idealised in
  so many women’s magazines. Maybe in wearing the Bunny symbol, what young
  women are saying is that they are proud of their womanly curves, and
  prefer them to looking like a heroin-addicted stick.
  
  Another positive take on the Bunny’s return is that in donning this
  long-standing symbol of female oppression, women are reclaiming it as a
  sign of empowerment. In the same way that Gays reclaimed as a symbol of
  unity and pride the pink triangle that the Nazis used to brand and
  oppress them, young Bunny-wearing women are boldly proclaiming their
  faith in a world where Girl Power reigns and feminism - simply because
  it is no longer needed - is a thing of the past. In such a world girls
  can freely embrace both their femininity and sexuality without fear of -
  as one Girl-Power scholar puts it - its “usual worrisome baggage.”
  
  A less optimistic interpretation, however, is that women’s embrace of
  the Bunny reflects their sense of disillusionment with - rather than
  empowerment within - the post-industrial world in which they are coming
  of age. Maybe, more than we realise, young women are tuning in when we
  older ones complain of unequal wages, sexual harassment,
  family-unfriendly policies and impenetrable glass ceilings at the
  workplace. Perhaps they observe when those zealously guarding the reigns
  of power either ridicule our distress, or ignore it. For such young
  women, the Playboy symbol may hold out the time-honoured promise that if
  they’re pretty, “put out” and otherwise play their cards right, there is
  a way for them to make it to the top of the status and income pile: on
  the arm of a wealthy and powerful man.
  
  So which interpretation is the correct one? The evidence, in my view, is
  in favour of the Bunny as a symbol of Girl Power. Sure, there are
  differences in the way the Gay Pride movement reclaimed the pink
  triangle and the reappearance of the Bunny logo. The former was a
  self-consciously political act by a grass-roots activist movement, while
  the latter is nothing more than a marketing experiment. Nevertheless,
  there are natty shorts with the Bunny on it and many more without -
  ditto cute handbags - and significant numbers of young women are
  choosing to buy the former. Given what we know about the optimism of
  youth in general, and the disinterest of so many young women in a
  feminism they see as irrelevant to their lives, there is good reason to
  believe that in embracing the Bunny, young women see themselves as
  reclaiming male-centred ideas of femininity and female sexuality, and
  making them their own.
  
  It’s hard not to admire them. Certainly, you can’t blame them. Given the
  choice of viewing the future in such a promising light or as hedged and
  barricaded by entrenched, often subterranean but always fiercely
  defended power and privilege, who wouldn’t choose the former? And isn’t
  the belief that such a world can exist, indeed does exist, a necessary
  prerequisite for actually bringing it about? “You go girls,” I want to
  cheer. And so I will.
  
  I just hope they’re right.

  In the great debates about family/work balance and fertility rates,
  let’s not forget men.
  
  Someone had to do it. And I figured, it might as well be me. In the
  long-running debate about Australia’s fertility debate, someone had to
  point out that baby-making and baby-raising is not a solitary business.
  This means that it simply doesn’t make sense to keep pointing the finger
  of blame for Australia’s low birth rate at women alone.
  
  As I argue in my new book “What, No Baby: why women have lost the
  freedom to mother and how they can get it back” (extracted in Good
  Weekend 22/1), there is little question that men’s desire and decisions
  impact significantly on whether women who desire children actually wind
  up mothers. The truth is men can derail women’s maternity plans by
  failing to partner, failing to prove themselves good father material or
  simply refusing to have the kids that they promised their spouse years
  earlier they would want “one day”. Such problems, among others, are why
  it just doesn’t make sense to leave men out of discussions about the
  whys and wherefores of Australia’s low birthrates.
  
  But I know there are Australian men who have the incomes and credentials
  to be part of the problem, but have chosen instead to be part of the
  solution. That single men exist who are willing to commit to women they
  love within a reasonable time frame or when an unplanned pregnancy
  intrudes on well-laid plans. Men who, the moment they realise they are
  “just not that into” the maternity-yearning woman beside them, let her
  know so she can find someone who is. I realise that the nation has
  plenty of men willing to put aside their own anxieties about career and
  money - and ignore the fact that physiologically they still have time -
  so they can say “yes” to partners who want to get pregnant while they
  are still young.
  
  I call such blokes “the gorgeous men”.
  
  In fact, not only have men been wrongly excluded from discussions about
  Australia’s low fertility, but notions of “choice” have been promulgated
  that palpably lack the sophistication to accurately describe what women
  do when they decide against kids. To put it simply, women don’t always
  do what they choose to do. In particular, my research makes clear that
  while the vast majority of women want to mother, their freedom to choose
  children at any particular point is shaped and limited by a range of
  social circumstances and attitudes.
  
  It would be both unfair and illogical of me to claim that while women’s
  decisions about children are constrained by social attitudes and
  structures, men behave as they do because they are naturally rotten to
  the core. Instead, I have sought to examine not just what men do when it
  comes to partnering and parenthood, but what they want to do and would,
  if they were really free to choose.
  
  Not surprisingly, there are plenty of reasons for male hesitation when
  it comes to partnering and parenthood. Foremost among them is the desire
  of men to fulfil their obligations to their partners and kids without
  committing career hari-kari.
  
  Sadly, research suggests that the handful of men who really do swear off
  breakfast meeting, leave at 5:00 to pick up at creche and refuse to work
  weekends find themselves in the same career cul de sac as working
  mothers. Indeed, Australian managers are good at making clear to men in
  more ways then one that any worker who modifies his schedule to
  accommodate new fatherhood will be struck off the A-list for the crime
  of being inadequately “serious”. For instance, one study found that just
  8% of Australian manager believed fathers should be entitled to 52 weeks
  unpaid leave after the birth of a baby, while a mere third supported a
  five-day a year “special family leave” entitlement.
  
  What all this suggests is that most Australian workplaces remain hostile
  to anyone who removes their nose from the grindstone, not to working
  mothers per se. While social convention and pay inequality ensure that
  it is largely women who will attempt to modify their work patterns to
  achieve some semblance of balance between work and family - and wind up
  on the Mummy Track for their troubles - working fathers who attempt a
  similar juggling act will suffer the same career misfortune.
  
  In the same way that women don’t want to have to take it on the career
  chin when they become a mother, many men are also reluctant to fulfil
  their obligations to their partners, kids and - given the joy of
  fatherhood - themselves at the cost of their satisfaction and
  advancement at work. And why should either sex have to pay such a high
  and enduring cost (in superannuation and lifelong earning capacity, to
  name a few) for doing the right thing?
  
  My answer is that they shouldn’t. In the same way that women are
  entitled to resent the high costs Australian society demands of those
  who have children and to refuse to buy into manipulative claims that if
  they really loved their children they wouldn’t complain, men should also
  resist any assertion that if they were really gorgeous men, they would
  simply suck up whatever punishment the workplace doles out to active
  dads, and talk about how they were never really all that
  career-oriented, anyway.
  
  Rather, both genders need to join hands and insist that enough is
  enough. That’s it’s become too hard to have children in Australian
  society today, and that something - other than the present and future
  backs of working mothers and gorgeous fathers - has to give.

  WINSTON Churchill said that a fanatic was a person who couldn’t change
  his mind and wouldn’t change the subject.
  
  According to the dictionary, a fanatic is a person marked by an extreme,
  unreasoning enthusiasm for a cause.
  
  At times, some of Australia’s prominent civil libertarians sound like
  fanatics - most recently when defending the rights of odious recidivist
  sex offenders such as Victoria’s Mr Baldy, due for release from prison
  in August.
  
  Mr Baldy was locked up for serial crimes of kidnapping and shaving the
  heads of young boys before assaulting them. Soon after his first release
  from jail, he attacked a young child again.
  
  I know it’s the job of Liberty Victoria’s vice-president, Jamie
  Gardener, to condemn the intention of the Bracks Government to introduce
  electronic tagging of repeat offenders like Mr Baldy. And I know it’s
  his job to say things such as: “Liberty views with grave concern any
  adding-on of sentences to people who have served their time set down by
  the courts, (because this) is not something that is consistent with
  human rights.”
  
  But what folks like Mr Gardener often seem to forget is that no civil
  right, no matter how important, is absolute. The rights of repeat sex
  offenders like Mr Baldy need to be balanced against those of the
  children to be protected from being his next victim.
  
  Otherwise, when absolute rights clash, impenetrable deadlock is the
  result, and all chance of consensus are lost.
  
  The question is, does the Bracks plan get that balance right? I think it
  does.
  
  Mr Gardener’s worry seems to be that tagging offenders punishes them
  twice ~~- first by incarceration, then by monitoring~~- for the same
  crime.
  
  But this is not a continuing worry. If the tagging legislation passes,
  future sentences will include post-release surveillance rather than
  adding it on at the end.
  
  This means that this problem - technically termed “double jeopardy” -
  falls away.
  
  The real infringement of electronic surveillance is on a prisoner’s
  rights to privacy. WHETHER the data from their bracelet is downloaded
  daily through the phone or transmitted in real time, those wearing
  electronic tags will be living in the Panopticon - an architectural
  figure envisioned by political philosopher Jeremy Bentham.
  
  It has a central tower around which is built an annular structure
  divided into cells that extend the entire width of the building to allow
  both inner and outer windows.
  
  The occupants of the cells are isolated from one another by walls, but
  able to be observed collectively and individually by an unseen observer
  in the tower.
  
  The problem for the prisoners of the Panopticon is that they can be seen
  - and know they can - but they are unable to see in return. They have no
  idea of who is looking at them, when, and what - if anything - those
  people plan to do with the knowledge they gain.0
  
  Even if data on their movements is not to be used against them
  (something that is not the case with the electronic tag, which will most
  likely be used to ensure prisoners conform to whatever movement
  restrictions the courts sets down as a condition of their release),
  those in the Panopticon suffer a complete loss of privacy and the
  dignity and personal power that comes with it.
  
  But if the electronic tags actually stop paedophiles from re-offending,
  then this loss must be weighed against the gain of increased community
  safety.
  
  According to Don Thomson, Professor of Forensic Psychology at Charles
  Sturt University, we have reason to think that tagging will deter
  offenders from committing further crimes against children. If the
  prisoner knows an alarm will sound if he violates prescribed boundaries,
  he’s unlikely to do so on pain of either being caught in the act or, if
  the violation is discovered only later, the certainty of being convicted
  and locked away, perhaps for good.
  
  And there is some evidence from a handful of studies that electronic
  monitoring, if combined with effective therapy, does reduce rates of
  reoffending.
  
  But this is the rub.
  
  While the government is effusive about the benefits of surveillance,
  there’s been no mention of increased funding for the evaluation and
  provision of effective treatment for sex offenders. Yet is it critical
  that such funding be provided, not only to ensure we get value from the
  money spent on the bracelets, but because treatment is the best way to
  make the community as safe as we can for children.
  
  According to Professor Thomson, money is desperately needed to both
  properly evaluate which treatments work and to provide them to convicts
  inside and outside the prison walls (where the temptation of real
  children running around provides the one true test of cure).
  
  Until funds to do this work are found, we can’t really look our children
  in the eye and say we’ve done all we can to make them safe.
  
  Because the best way to avoid released prisoners re-offending is not to
  track them, but to change them.

  As Prime Minister John Howard put it: “You can’t have a situation where
  every time somebody dares to express a view, they’re jumped upon from a
  great height and it’s said the issue is back on the agenda.”
  
  He’s right. The country needs to take a few deep breaths, and a long
  view on abortion politics.
  
  We all know there is a strident coterie of conservative, misogynist men
  in the inner circle of Government who are not only completely opposed to
  women having a right to choose abortion at any stage of pregnancy, but
  determined to do something about it.
  
  What this means is that over the next few years we are going to be
  hearing a lot from this powerful posse about female irresponsibility
  when it comes to contraception. We’ll be getting an earful about callous
  feminist career-women who selfishly choose abortion instead of
  motherhood, or depressed and regretful “post-abortive” women who
  demonstrate the folly of society trusting the female of the species to
  make important decisions about their own futures, and they’ll be heaps
  about the number of abortions that Australian women have. They’ll be
  more assertions than you can shake a stick at about the tragedy of
  “late-term” abortions (a term that will never be defined but will be
  applied to all terminations done after 12 or 14 weeks) and our ears will
  be bashed with graphic descriptions of termination techniques used after
  the first trimester.
  
  It will be implied that abortion causes breast cancer despite the US
  National Cancer Institute stating unequivocally in 2003 (based on a meta
  analysis of all existing population-based, clinical and animal studies)
  that “having an abortion or miscarriage does not increase a woman’s
  subsequent risk of developing breast cancer”. It will be asserted that
  abortion causes post-traumatic stress, despite Ronald Regan’s Surgeon
  General, the anti-choice C. Everett Koop, concluding that psychological
  problems from abortion were “minuscule from a public health
  perspective”, and a panel of the American Psychological Foundation
  concluding in 1989 that terminating an unwanted pregnancy posed no
  hazard to women’s mental health.
  
  Questions will be raised about the safety of Mifepristone (RU 486), a
  drug unavailable in Australia as a result of past anti-choice activism
  despite it being used safely for many years by millions of women in at
  least 19 countries. Assertions will be made about the unfairness of
  making anti-choice taxpayers subsidize women’s abortions through
  Medicare (though the entitlement of bike-riders to withdraw their taxes
  from the building of roads, will not be mentioned).
  
  My point is twofold. First, we’ve got a long, long way to go until the
  next federal election. From this point until at least then - and maybe
  longer, given current predictions about time needed for Labour to become
  competitive again - we can feel confident that anti-choice Coalition
  forces are going to use their power and influence in any way they can to
  stir the pot on the abortion issue.
  
  Are we going to jump every time any one of them says, “boo”? Dance like
  marionettes whenever they tug (the same old) string? How many times can
  and should we “debate” the same issues, particularly when - despite all
  the argy-bargy at the tail end of last year - a national public opinion
  survey done by the ANU showed 81% of Australians agreeing that women
  should have a right to choose?
  
  Which brings me to my second point. Putting a question on notice (as
  Boswell has done) is not “reigniting the debate.” Politicians repeating
  their well-known personal views on the issue (as Beazley has done) is
  not “re-igniting the debate”. In fact, these contributions - such as
  they are - are barely newsworthy. If I may quote dictionary.com, a
  debate is a “discussion involving opposing points”.
  
  But what is the “point” of Boswell asking for precise numbers of
  terminations, given he’s among the crowd that thinks even one is too
  many. Isn’t it a foregone conclusion he’ll conclude, no matter what
  figure he gets, that it’s too high? Thanks to the prolonged discussion
  last year on the topic, we know what anti-choice MPs think about
  abortion: they don’t like them, or approve of the women who have them.
  What we don’t know is what the legislative intent is of the MPs who keep
  doing whatever it takes to return abortion to the news. As co-conveners
  of Emily’s List Joan Kirner and Claire Moore put it yesterday, a public
  debate on this issue run by politicians without any declared legislative
  change is “at best unnecessary and at worst misleading.”
  
  What are anti-choice MPs plotting to do to women’s freedom to get an
  abortion? How are their secret plans going to affect the freedom of
  Australian women and couples to decide for themselves if and when
  they’ll have children?
  
  Such revelations would not only be newsworthy, they would provide the
  information for a real debate, and a fair political battle, to begin.
  Once the doors of all those prayer sessions and secret meetings are
  flung open, Australian women and families will finally know - instead of
  having to guess - precisely how their reproductive freedoms are going to
  come under attack in the next few years. Experts will be able to
  evaluate and make comment on how women and couples, from city and bush
  and those of greater and lesser means, would be affected by mooted
  administrative changes and legislative proposals. The media could ask
  politicians to state their voting intentions, and Australian women and
  couples would finally know how they, and those they love, are likely to
  be affected by the changes proposed.
  
  So let’s stop the pseudo-debate, and let the real one begin.

  Ita Buttrose & Dr Penny Adams. Penguin/Viking, $32.95
  
  TEASE: Motherguilt bills itself as a book in which Australian women
  “revel their true feelings about motherhood” and one that assists women
  to “deprogram themselves” from the powerful and unique “epidemic of
  guilt” experienced by today’s mothers.
  
  The strength of the book is the myriad of women’s voices found on each
  page. Both celebrity and “ordinary” mothers confess their parental sins
  and doubts, and express their views on a wide range of maternal
  experiences (mothering the “not-so-perfect” child, the experience of
  breastfeeding, maternal competitiveness in the playgroup).
  
  It’s not easy for women to admit they’ve found mothering unbearably
  boring, or that they’ve sometimes put their child’s need second to their
  own, when such admissions can lead them to be labelled a “bad” mother.
  Yet, 69-year old Jean risks this by sharing her disappointment with her
  early mothering experience. “I can remember thinking,”, she recounts,
  “‘If this is my life, my God, I’d rather be dead’.” Journalist Adele
  Horin take us into her confidence with her tale of sending a sick child
  to school so she could get to work, while presenter Joanna Griggs
  confesses that she has the “time of her life” when away from her
  children covering sport for Channel 7. As the authors rightly note,
  women’s sharing of their maternal battle stories “has a curative power
  all of its own”.
  
  Sadly, the rest of Motherguilt seems dedicated to wounding, rather than
  healing. Instead of alleviating women’s guilt feelings about motherhood,
  it appears dedicated to affirming their current levels of moral angst,
  or even making them worse. For example, the authors assert without a
  shred of research evidence that contemporary mothers use abortion as
  contraception, see babies as “fashion accessories” and, in failing to be
  relaxed and happy mothers, deny their children the carefree childhood
  that is their “inalienable right”. Stay-at-home mothers are castigated
  for giving up their professional careers and allowing their kids’ school
  lives to take on exaggerated importance, as well as providing a poor
  role model to their children by helping them cheat on homework
  assignments.
  
  But it is working mothers who really need to duck for cover. According
  to the authors, their reliance on prepared and fast foods coupled with
  their failure to serve up a family meal every night is the cause of
  increased rates of childhood obesity; their busy lives and
  competitiveness causes stressed, depressed and ADHD kids who miss out on
  time to “gaze at the clouds drifting by, watch a butterfly flit around
  the garden or throw pebbles in a pond”; while their lack of time to
  listen to their teenagers increases adolescent drinking and anorexia.
  
  Similarly alarming “facts” and accusations appear throughout the book,
  though they must always be taken on faith as no sources - either in the
  text or in notes - are provided.
  
  But most disturbing are the authors’ conclusions about the causative
  role contemporary mothers are playing in the downfall of the nation’s
  children. This is Ita:
  
  > The growth in children’s illnesses and mood disturbances has occurred
  > in line with mothers’ greater participation in the workforce. Could
  > this be coincidental? Can any intelligent woman seriously believe such
  > a thing without doubt of any kind? Surely it is impossible to overlook
  > something many mothers would prefer to close their eyes to - that
  > perhaps children have become the \`victims’ of the female ambition to
  > have it all.
  
  She continues:
  
  > Many women got it wrong, and I include myself in this indictment. It
  > is all too obvious that children need more of their mother’s time than
  > we have been able to give them….Perhaps, most of all they need their
  > mums to be in less of a hurry….If, as mothers, we need to feel guilty
  > about anything it is children. We have short-changed them. They have
  > been sending out signals for years now but we have preferred to be
  > blind to what has been going on.
  
  This quote tidily encapsulates all that is wrong with Motherguilt. The
  unsupported alarmist claims; the uncritical acceptance of complex and
  heavily-freighted ideas like “having it all” without any interrogation
  of the sexist 1950s norms they encode; the imputation that children need
  only their mothers and the corresponding silence about father-absence
  and its impact on women’s work and guilt-loads as well as children; the
  firm yet tautological claim that the one thing mothers should feel
  guilty about is children (what else would women feel motherguilt about?)
  
  A recent letter to the Australian Book Review noted that “even a badly
  written book has cost the author blood and sweat”. It was not a plea for
  merciful reviewing, but could be read as one, and as a non-fiction
  writer myself, I am sensitive to the harm done by a bad review.
  
  But whatever compassion I feel for the authors, I feel much more for
  their potential female readership. Indeed, I feel obligated to do what I
  can to warn women of the disconnect between what this book promises and
  what it delivers.
  
  Because I just can’t bear the thought of a young mother - anxious,
  insecure, perhaps even teetering on the edge of depression - wandering
  into her local bookshop in search of something that might help her to
  understand her situation better and lift her spirits, leaving instead
  with a load of Motherguilt.

  Women academics under-achieving has nothing to do with biology or
  inclination
  
  Since the middle of January, when he theorised that an important reason
  for the shortage of tenured female scientists and engineers in
  American’s top universities and researcher institutions was women’s lack
  of “instrinsic aptitude”, calls for his resignation have been coming
  thick and fast. His defenders have fought back, insisting that Summers
  has been unfairly shouted down by a politically correct cadre of
  feminists.
  
  A transcript of Summers’ remarks on the Harvard website show his
  speculation on the causes of female scientific and mathematical
  under-achievement was three-pronged. Discrimination plays a small part,
  Summers opined, but the rest of the problem could be slated home to
  women’s natural mediocrity (their under-representation in the left tail
  of a bell curve measuring scientific and mathematical IQ), and their
  unwillingness to work hard.
  
  But while has been his claims about female biology that have caused him
  so much grief, it was the Harvard President’s “high-powered job” thesis
  that really irked me.
  
  Essentially, it re-badges institutional gender inequity as the morally
  neutral consequences of women’s work and family “choices”. High-powered
  jobs, says Summer, demand 80 hour weeks, time flexibility, continuous
  and diligent effort throughout the lifecycle and a mind that is “always
  working on the problems that are in the job, even when the job is not
  taking place”. Married men, says Summers, have historically been more
  “prepared” to make this “commitment” than married women.
  
  There’s no doubt that the thesis that women (bless their deep and
  karmically balanced souls) are “opting out” of the rat race and
  “redefining success” - rather than bashing their heads against iron
  ceilings - is extremely popular at the moment. A 2003 cover story in the
  New York Times Magazine put the case this way. Beneath a photo of a
  mother and baby cuddling at the foot of a ladder, it asked “Why don’t
  more women get to the top?”. The answer: “They choose not to.”
  
  Convenient? I’ll say. But the trouble is that there’s no evidence that
  when mothers have real choice, they dump their plans to have the same
  “all” as men have always enjoyed and sedately file home. Instead, what
  data there is suggests that when women do give up and accept life on the
  Mummy-track, a lack of real options to balance work and family is the
  cause.
  
  The key to all this is the contrast between what choice looks like in
  the abstract, versus its appearance in the real world. In the abstract,
  unspoken and patently false presumptions about the full and fair context
  in which women make decisions about career and family lead to
  disinterested conclusions that women’s failure to achieve is the
  consequence of their work “choices”. In the real world, women know they
  can only make authentic choices consistent with their needs and values
  when there is an adequate range of high quality options available, and
  they are free to decide between them.
  
  Here’s just some of what a 2004 US Government Accountability Office
  report found when it asked women science students and academics why they
  worked at smaller institutions, taught more, and more often on a
  part-time basis: behaviour that they all knew significantly reduced
  their odds of successfully competing against the men in their department
  for tenure.
  
  Firstly, most female PhD student said they intended to seek a position
  at a small college, where they’ll teach more and research less, in order
  to maintain a work family balance. Secondly, women said they worked
  part-time more often then men in order to juggle family life with a
  tenure track position. Thirdly, they complained that because they
  shoulder the bulk of the second shift at home but their male colleagues
  don’t, gender-neutral university assistance programs to parents - like
  an extra year after a baby is born to publish before a tenure decision
  is made - does nothing more than further advantage their male colleagues
  in the tenure competition at their expense.
  
  What all this, not to mention logic, suggests is that women “choose”
  their health, sanity and the well-being of their children and their
  marriage against their own career advancement in the same way animals
  caught in steel trap traps “choose” to gnaw of their legs.
  
  And when women aren’t trapped? Anecdotal evidence (and that’s most of
  what’s around, given the dearth of high-quality family-friendly
  employment) suggests that they stay, excel, and achieve.
  
  In fact, the only real chance of ever testing Summers’ thesis about the
  role biology plays in women’s work patterns is to eliminate the effect
  gender discrimination and bias has on them. Only when the playing field
  is truly level - both at home and at work - will we know whether men
  keep rising to the top because they really are the cream.

  Having found a lost a “son”, the Minister should be less critical of
  others
  
  The message from Health Minister Tony Abbott remains unequivocal:
  Kathleen Donnelly, the mother of his wrongly assumed son, Daniel
  O’Connor, is a “nice” girl.
  
  As the latest twist in the ongoing adoption reunion story broke on
  Monday night, Abbott made his continuing fondness for his old girlfriend
  clear, despite his newfound awareness that she was sexually involved
  with other men during the years he believed they were having an
  exclusive affair.
  
  While reporters repeatedly invited him to dump on Donnelly, Abbott
  refused to pass judgement about what he described as “hot-blooded young
  people”.
  
  “We were all pretty wild back then so I am not in the business of making
  critical judgements. She is a great girl and this doesn’t change any of
  that”.
  
  Indeed, in his interviews with the press last month, Abbott has
  suggested that his “callow” decision to go overseas during Donnelly’s
  pregnancy must also be understood in the context of his youthful
  immaturity. Presumably, a similar explanation accounts for the couple’s
  failure to use contraception throughout their years of intimate
  involvement.
  
  Such sentiments should be music to the ears of the vast majority of
  Australians who support a woman’s right to choose. They imply that
  having recently tried to give parents access to their teenager’s medical
  records in order to stop their “open-slather sexual activity”, and to
  restrict the access of women and couples to safe and affordable
  abortion, Tony Abbott has seen the error of his ways.
  
  Having refused to judge or condemn Donnelly for past mistakes, or
  behaviour inconsistent with his moral values, is Abbott finally prepared
  to recognise the arrogance of his past judgement of other woman and
  couples who - like he and Donnelly - had sex and unintentionally wound
  up pregnant? To realise that like he and Donnelly, we are all nice
  people doing our best to live what we see as moral lives but at times
  get waylaid by cloudy judgement, immaturity or sheer bad luck? That
  everyone deserves to have their behaviour and decisions interpreted in
  the context of their limits, and the framework of their lives?
  
  If Donnelly can violate Abbott’s code of sexual morality but still be
  judged a nice girl, then why not the rest of us? If the definition of a
  nice girl (and boy, for that matter) is a person who does their best to
  live well in a complex world where things don’t always go to plan, don’t
  we all qualify?
  
  What remains unclear is whether Abbott’s complex personal situation will
  lead him to question his rigid and long-held views of female sexuality
  and reproductive obligation. Remember, he comes from a family that
  Donnelly says froze her out the moment they discovered she was pregnant.
  Will Tony Abbott’s intimate engagement with the real world, with all its
  shades of grey, collapse the nice girl/slut distinction that has driven
  his agenda on sexuality and reproduction for so long?
  
  According to psychologist Dr Susie Allanson, a counsellor of 15 years at
  the East Melbourne Fertility Control Clinic, the odds are regrettably
  slim. Over the years Allanson has counselled a number of women who are
  not just morally opposed to abortion but have actively campaigned
  against it being safe and legal. Yet, when they have found themselves
  unhappily pregnant, they decide in favour of abortion.
  
  The problem, says Allanson, is that while such women sympathise with
  their own situation and feel confident their case justifies an abortion,
  most refuse to allow their experience translate to compassion for other
  women facing the same dilemma. Instead, these women prefer to see their
  experience as unique and so no challenge to their abortion politics or
  their uncompromising judgement of all aborting women - except
  themselves, of course - as murderers.
  
  Hypocrisy? You bet. And the worry is that Abbott will fall victim to
  this most universally despised moral failing, too. That instead of
  recognising that the personal limits and situational complexity
  characterising his case precisely mirror the dilemmas others face on the
  sexual, contraceptive and unplanned pregnancy front, that he’ll insist
  on seeing them as one-off and one-of-a-kind. That rather than preserve
  the freedom he and Kathleen had to make their own decisions - even
  mistakes - and to take responsibility for them, he’ll continue to do all
  in his power to deny those caught in a similar bind the freedom to
  choose with dignity, according to their own needs and values.
  
  According to Dr Allanson, imposing one’s rigid views on others relieves
  the stress of those who find the contemporary world chaotic.
  “Must-abating about others,” says Allanson, “gives such people a sense
  of control”.
  
  Tony Abbott has had control of his sexual and reproductive world and
  now, as Health Minister in a government about to take control of both
  houses of parliament, he is about to assume unprecedented control of
  ours. The question is whether he will finally allow the evidence of his
  own experience to collapse his rigid views about how others should
  behave when it comes to sex, contraception and decisions about unplanned
  pregnancies. Or will his rigid views about nice girls and sluts live to
  see - and to guide the nation’s health policy - another day?

  by Marg Vandeleur, Penguin. RRP $22.95
  
  TEASE: Spritely, sure-footed, rich with colour and authentic
  understanding of place, The Catch by first-time author Marg Vandeleur
  maintains its innocence and light-heartedness on a potentially
  chin-dragging topic: the shortage of suitable men for
  desperately-ticking women.
  
  At close to 36, curvaceous and pleasantly placid Colette (Letty) is
  feeling her eggs age as she struggles to recover from a break-up with
  her longstanding philandering boyfriend, and to find a suitable man with
  whom to produce the baby for which she longs. A longing that she
  attempts, though fails, to adequately explain to her child-indifferent
  best friend, an insouciant lesbian novelist named Jules:
  
  No Jules didn’t feel it. Perhaps that was where her ease, her lightness,
  came from. The longing for a baby weighted Letty down. It was an
  undertow to her existence. The further from her grasp it slipped, the
  more intense the churning.
  
  After a somewhat predictable romp for a suitable man through Melbourne’s
  tragic dating scene (where angry divorced men and pathologically shy
  ones fail to arrest her attention), Letty discovers that it’s no stroll
  through the park finding a suitable donor amongst paternity-longing gay
  men either. But finally Jules hits gold and introduces her to her match,
  the queenly and caring Robert. Having abandoned the noisy landmark
  Fitzroy street cafe Marios as a suitable site for the initial meet and
  greet, she and Jules set the rendezvous at a pub across the street from
  a pram-packed park. Robert is quick to list his qualifications for the
  job:
  
  I’m kind. I’m not the smartest guy in the world, but I’m not dumb
  either. I find little things amusing. I’ve always wanted a baby and now
  my clock is ticking double-time. I’d make a lovely father. And I’ve had
  all the tests. I’ve got about seven hundred thousand billion sperm or
  something like that. A lot.
  
  Never self-indulgent, or obviously politically correct (the narrative’s
  attaching of parental longing to both straight and gay men and women
  deftly undermines any essentialist understanding of Letty’s quest),
  Vandeleur paints a picture of the quintessential modern woman facing the
  “What, no baby?” problem. The problem faced by too many educated,
  interesting, and accomplished Australian women in finding the right sort
  of man to love and share the work and sacrifices of parenting before the
  sands of their fertile years run out.
  
  But while Letty’s arduous journey through donor selection and
  self-impregnation leave us with no illusions about the significant
  “catch” attached to the desires of single women for motherhood, and
  Letty makes no bones bones about her desire to “catch” the right man,
  neither does she intend to be “caught” in any old relationship simply
  because she knows her time is running out. Her self-esteem so
  fundamental to who she is as to need no remark, Letty understands - and
  proceeds on the principle - that she is better off parenting a donor-bub
  alone then partnered to a man who doesn’t attract her physically and
  emotionally (her pet hate is scuffed shoes with a business suit). It’s
  hard not to like Letty as she doggedly pursues her maternal dreams
  through “Weekly Weighers” and several failed pregnancy attempts without
  losing her sense of humour, proportion, or compassion for the various
  trials of her gang of colourful friends.
  
  Her emotional needs met by her friends, her financial by her own
  start-up business, Letty seems to demonstrate the truth of recent
  research findings that while women still want me, they don’t need them.
  And it is the gap between what women desire, and men are willing or able
  to produce - at least for those in the current “transitional” generation
  like Letty - that is causing all the angst.

  For me, school holidays are like housework: highly demanding,
  ever-present and seemingly never done. My problem, in a nutshell, is
  while I’d be happy to have the kids at home, the demands of my work mean
  this only sporadically and occasionally possible. Most of the time, I
  need care. This means that every time those dreaded two weeks draw near,
  my “to-do” list looks like this.
  
  First, reschedule and otherwise shift as much work as possible away from
  the period in question. Then, ask my partner what days might be
  available at his office when the other directors won’t have their kids
  with them, clients won’t be visiting and he’ll be able to shift his
  workload around enough to send a few employees home so that he can park
  our kids in front of computer games and the world wide web for the day.
  Simultaneously SOS everyone on my “working parents” email contact list
  to discover if we can coordinate care swaps (of the “I’ll take your
  older one Friday if you’ll have mine on Monday but only if both of us
  can make similar arrangements for the younger ones on those days too” -
  type) or mutual activities (of the “mine will only go to sports camp if
  your child goes too” - type). Finally, ring up both sets of grandparents
  and plead for the odd day or three
  
  By the time that final Friday arvo bell rings (one hour earlier than
  usual, just to add insult to injury) my desktop resembles a war room.
  Phone ringing, palm pilot synching, incoming e-mail indicator bobbing
  like a jack in the box, and - as testament to my weeks of effort - a
  calendar hastily blu-tacked to the wall splattered with victorious blue
  tics and a measle-rash of red question marks.
  
  Perhaps not surprisingly, I find this process depressing. Not just
  because of the persistence, eye for detail and logistical ingenuity it
  entails, but its sheer repetitiveness. It feels like I’ve only just
  recovered from organising myself for one school holiday, when the next
  one looms. I also find it frustrating that in spite of my efforts, my
  children nearly always end up attending programs that are either low
  quality, exorbitantly expensive or - when things really go pear-shaped -
  both. And I’m one of the lucky ones: at least I can afford some paid
  care. A recent study showed that many Australian parents can’t, and are
  instead forced to take their annual leave at different times to cover
  the mismatch between the demands of work and those of school breaks.
  
  The truth is that the decision to divide the approximately 11 weeks
  annual leave to which teachers and students are entitled into three two
  weeks breaks, and five weeks around Christmas, reeks of 1950s
  assumptions about parental work patterns that have relevance for
  families of today.
  
  ABS figures show that around half of families with children under 15
  have both parents in the workforce. While many mothers (and a handful of
  fathers) reduce their hours to reconcile the daily incongruity between
  school and work hours, part-time work doesn’t solve the problems caused
  by school holidays. For this, parents need a “term time” clause in their
  contract. In one UK survey, 38% of women and 32% of men said they did or
  would use such a clause if it were available to them. With 47% of women
  and 34% of Australian men rating the freedom not to work during school
  holidays as important, one might imagine a similarly enthusiastic
  response here.
  
  Yet many scholars now believe that parents are increasingly interested
  in changing the world so they can balance work and family, rather than
  using “special benefits” solutions to reduce the imbalance. In part,
  this is likely to be because of the negative impact parental use of
  part-time work, flexi-time and other such arrangements tends to have on
  their wages, career progression and job security. Instead, parents want
  institutions - like work and school - to change to better suit them.
  
  How could this be done? My proposal is that for most of the year, school
  should be a heads down/bums up affair, with breaks of only one week
  during the spring and autumn. This leaves around 8 weeks for an extended
  break over the summer which could start before Christmas and run through
  most of February.
  
  Not only would this approach keep kids out of the classroom during the
  hottest days of the year, and return to families of lesser means the
  freedom to holiday together, it would also enable the summer camp
  business - day and overnight - to develop and thrive.
  
  Such camps would offer high quality care for children at lower costs in
  part because every year staff, food, insurance and transport need to be
  organised only once. And, mercifully, only once would also be the number
  of times parents needing care for their children during the break would
  need to examine the options, pay their money and make their choice.

  The Moral of the Story: An anthology of ethics through literature edited
  by Peter Singer and Renata Singer RRP: $49.95\
  TEASE: Over my (far too) many years of studentship and academic
  employment, I have bought (far too) many books, (far too) many of which
  have stagnated on my shelves, growing dusty and churlish from disuse.
  Amongst this unedifying lot have never been tomes edited or authored by
  Peter Singer. This is not because it is impossible to disagree with
  Singer, or to occasionally find his fearless exploration of the most
  complex, sensitive and interesting ethical issues of our times
  unsatisfying terse and one-dimensional. But rather because with the
  exception of de Botton, Singer is without peer when it comes to picking
  the right topic and penning erudite and accessible prose steeped in
  casual references to philosophical debates on similar issues dating back
  thousands of years. In The Moral of the Story, written in partnership
  with wife Renata, he does it again, compiling an anthology that
  students, academic philosophers and writers interested in ethics (and
  what writer isn’t) will pull off the shelf to thumb through again and
  again.
  
  The Singers describe themselves as editors of The Moral of the Story but
  they are much more. Clearly dedicated readers of quality fiction, they
  do a superlative job at what I’m sure was the humbling task of selecting
  - then editing for purpose and sense - the back-list of western
  civilisation. Having been refused permission by a number of authors,
  including American Psycho author Bret Easton Ellis, to anthologise their
  work in the collection, they ultimately settle on 79 excerpts by 61
  authors. These include pieces from Genesis, Sophocles, Shelly, Ibsen,
  Dickens, Arna Bontemps, James Baldwin, S. Yizhar, Ursula Le Guin, Joyce
  Carol Oates, Kathy Lette and the comic writer Douglas Adams.
  
  I was familiar with about one quarter of the material, though
  interestingly I found this neither diminished (through repetition) or
  enhanced (because of my stored bank of additional knowledge of character
  and plot) my enjoyment of the material. Instead, the pruning of each
  selection and its filing under a particular section heading (as a story
  exploring “Duties to God” or the moral issues that arise around paid
  “Work” or “War”) refocused my attention on a previously unconsidered
  aspect of a particular tale, giving the story - no matter how familiar -
  new life.
  
  But the real value-add comes in the Preface to collection, and the
  Singers’ introduction to each of the book’s 15 sections. Here they set
  the ethical scene, introducing the issues in play - and the conflict of
  values that typically arise - when considering, say, “Duties to Kin”,
  “New Life Forms” or “Animals and the Environment”. As well, those
  interested in using the book’s fictional excerpts as a teaching aid will
  find a range of issues and pertinent questions arising from each
  selection compiled at the back.
  
  Some of these introductions are done extremely well. I was particularly
  impressed with the one on “Love, marriage and sex”, in which the authors
  observe that while the decision of whether and who to marry will “have
  more impact on our lives than most other decision we make”, there has
  been “relatively little serious discussion about the values underlying
  the choice of mate”. They then briefly explore the various literary
  models of the ideal romantic relationship: Shakespeare’s depiction of
  sudden passionate love in Romeo and Juliet; de Maupassant’s contention
  in The Model that lasting love requires a “deeper union of the minds”;
  Seth’s suggestion, made through Lata’s ultimate choice of Haresh for her
  husband in A Suitable Boy, that arranged marriages based upon common
  values provides the firmest foundation for mature love to eventually
  flourish.
  
  Unfortunately, other such preemptory remarks are less consistent with
  the spirit of inquiry, rather than argument, that rightly characterises
  an exploration of ethics through literature. Indeed, what the authors
  seem to miss in their early discussion of the key differences in the way
  literature and philosophy approach ethics is the ultimately different
  aims of each for doing so. The aim of philosophical argument is to prove
  the rightness of one’s own claims, in part, by exposing the flaws in our
  opponents’ arguments. In contrast, the best books and plays resist the
  temptation to argue conclusively for a particular point of view.
  Instead, they seek to deepen our emotional understanding of the
  complexity and profundity of particular value conflicts by putting the
  sharpest most persuasive arguments in the mouths of the characters on
  both side of the case. This not only sharpens the value conflict and
  consequently the drama, but grants legitimacy to the existence of the
  conflict in the first place.
  
  “There’s no need to fight about these things,” says the philosopher.
  “This argument proves conclusively that the others are wrong and I am
  right.”
  
  “Of course we must fight about these things,” counters the writer. “Who
  but God could witness such a contest and have any idea who is right?”
  
  To avoid the emotional retreat and defensiveness that many have to
  philosophical preaching, novelists draw us into a conflict by
  emphasising its acuity, and the lack of certainty even very good people
  can feel about the right thing to do. Ironically, this suggests that the
  road to a deep and full understanding of the nature and meaning of a
  moral dilemma also leads to moral relativism.
  
  Now there’s a conundrum on which I would have like to have heard the
  Singers pronounce.

  Did unconscious sexism lead to a miscarriage of justice in the case of
  Karen Ellis? On Thursday, the Court of Appeals threw out the 22 month
  suspended sentence handed down in November by the County Court and
  re-sentenced the 37 year old school teacher to nearly three years, 6
  months of which she must serve in jail. The ruling found the initial
  sentence had violated the principle of equality, including “equality of
  concern for male and female victims and equality in the sentencing of
  male and female offenders.”
  
  “It is no longer acceptable,” said Justice Callaway, who presided over
  the appeal, “that an offender be given a different sentence solely
  because of his or her sex.”
  
  For many, the facts of the Ellis case justified leniency. Ellis had made
  full and frank admissions of her guilt and saved the State the expense
  of a trial. She was clearly remorseful, lacked self pity and has already
  suffered significant costs related to her trial and conviction. Her
  career is finished as she can no longer work with children, her
  placement on the sexual offenders registry - despite the court’s view
  that she is “very unlikely” to re-offend - ensures a future of
  considerable imposition and embarrassment for her and her three children
  and the absence of a wedding ring at yesterday’s hearing suggests her
  marriage is in trouble.
  
  As well, the then–15 year old student Benjamin has insisted that he knew
  at all times what he was doing and wanted to do it. He has even tendered
  ferociously loyal statements to the Court in support of his former
  teacher.
  
  But Ellis victimised more than Benjamin. Her behaviour was an abuse of
  both her power, and the trust placed in her - and those of all teachers
  - by students, colleagues, employers, parents and society as a whole.
  Moreover, while sex was not forced - if it was, the charge would have
  been rape rather than penetration - the law holds that children under
  sixteen simply lack the competence to consent to sexual activity with an
  adult, particularly an adult in a position of power and authority. And
  despite Ben’s assertion of being unusually mature for his age, the Court
  found that his statements reflected an “insouciance about the moral
  issues involved” that would be “disturbing” coming from anyone who
  wasn’t so young. Indeed, his Honour suggests the possibility that Ellis
  may have stunted Ben’s moral development, given the approval her
  behaviour signalled to irresponsible sexual relationships and activity.
  
  The ultimate sexism test is to read a roll call of Ellis’s crimes and to
  substitute male pronouns for female ones when the reference is to the
  teacher, and female for male when the student is discussed. Try it
  yourself on the summary of the facts of the case I’ve excerpted from the
  Court of Appeal’s ruling:
  
  A 36-year-old married teacher begins kissing her 15-year-old year 10
  student during secret meetings at school. Soon after, she collects him
  in her car, drives to her house and they have sex upstairs in the
  marital bed. One month later she collects the student and drives to her
  house to have sex. After she drops him off near his home in the early
  hours of the morning. This happens again a few days later, after which
  she drops him near the school. Days later she collects him at the train
  station and she performs oral sex on him at her house followed, the next
  morning, by intercourse. On her day off, she collects him at the school
  and again drives him to her house to have sex.
  
  I’ll be frank, and admit my feelings did change depending on whether the
  pronoun-conjured offender was male or female (though interestingly the
  sex of the victim had little impact on my feelings of disgust and
  outrage). The truth is, I intuitively felt more sympathy for the female
  teacher.
  
  Years ago I remember feeling dismayed by a study showing that students
  were more likely to rate the exact same essay highly if the name at the
  top was John, instead of Josephine, Doe. The truth is that our
  unconscious views about the capacities, culpability and characters of
  men and women do shape the way we understand events, and render
  judgements about fault.
  
  But this is not how it ought to be, and the Appeals Court has been right
  to say so, and to ensure that in the Ellis case, justice was finally
  done.

  Workers are demanding better working conditions, and conditions for
  family life
  
  If debate on this page over the last few weeks has made anything clear,
  it is that motherhood has driven a red-hot stake through the heart of
  the sisterhood - if such a thing ever existed in the first place. Equal
  pay for equal work, more funding for women’s diseases like breast
  cancer, tougher sentences for rapists: on these things most women agree.
  But as Naomi Wolf discovered during her jaunt through Australia’s
  capital cities last week, mention motherhood and the claws come out.
  
  Yet despite the difficulties women and the women’s movement have talking
  about motherhood - or more precisely the nature of the conflict mothers
  experience between work and family and how it should be resolved - it
  remains an issue of major issue concern for contemporary women. Not just
  women who already have children, but the 92% of young women who want to
  have them, as well as a steady partner and career, in the future.
  
  Feminists have been the ones who have identified women’s unhappiness
  about work/family imbalance and the main ones to suggest solutions to
  the problem, yet the women’s movement is unlikely to ever muster the
  political muscle to compel change. This is because the transformations
  required - no less than the structural reorganisation of paid employment
  and an increasingly globalised economy - are too major, and the forces
  arrayed against such change too powerful.
  
  Yet change will come. Indeed, profound changes in the size and makeup of
  Australia’s population that are already underway make it inevitable.
  
  Australian women now have on average only 1.73 children each, a
  fertility rate far below the 2.1 children per woman needed for steady
  population growth. And according to the ABS, the rapid dive of our
  fertility rate is set to continue. On one estimate, it will fall to 1.3
  by 2008. During this time, our already rapidly aging population will
  continue to age. Indeed, by 2051 the ABS predicts there will be three
  times as many Australians aged 65 to 84, and half the number of
  children, than was the case in 1971.
  
  What this means is that as the children of the largest generation we’ve
  had in quite some time, the Baby-Boomers, make their way from their
  current starting positions in the labour force to the positions of power
  their parents and those from Generation X now occupy, there will be
  increasingly smaller pools of applicants from which to select their
  replacements. Sure, business will do as it currently does today, compete
  like mad for skilled migrants to make up the difference, but given the
  low fertility scenario is happening across the western world, Australian
  business is unlikely to be successful enough to significantly relieve
  the skilled labour shortage.
  
  This is when things will get interesting. Because - unlike today -
  employers will no longer have the luxury to say, favour a childless
  applicant or a man with a full-time wife at home over a working mother
  to fill a given vacancy, the current practice of marginalizing workers -
  mostly mothers - who can’t arrive at 7:00 in the morning and put in
  face-time until 8:00 at night will end. As is always the case when
  labour is short, workers will have far more control than they do
  currently over their conditions of employment.
  
  Some will no doubt make the trade that global capitalism favours:
  exchanging increased productivity (read: more time every week at work)
  for higher wages. But I suspect many more will bargain for what is
  already and will continue to be the scarcest commodity in contemporary
  life - time. Along with their secure career-track jobs, these workers
  will demand capped time, fractional time, flexible time, work-at-home
  time and time to go visit their kids on the days the other parent -
  demanding the same conditions - is not at home with them at the
  subsidised work-place based cr&egrave;che. And it won’t just be working
  mothers demanding such conditions, it will be dads, too. Because if
  there is one way in which feminism has changed the world, it is in
  changing men’s beliefs not only about women’s right to paid employment,
  but their own responsibility to share in the work of running a household
  and raising the kids.
  
  Empty nesters wanting time to help care for their grandkids, childless
  workers wishing to donate quality time to a cherished social cause or
  hobby, the unemployed. All these groups, as well as parents, will
  benefit from the long overdue reversal of global capitalism’s relentless
  push towards the “downsizing” that means little more in their day-to-day
  lives than more time at the office doing two jobs instead of one. In the
  new world, it is more likely that two jobs will be shared between two
  and one half people, or even three.
  
  Rapidly declining fertility rates not only indicate the unhappiness of
  contemporary women and men with work/family imbalance, it points to the
  way the problem will be solved.
  
  And I for one, can’t wait.

  Start talking research methodology to journalists, and many will run
  screaming from the room. To be fair, the same might be said of some
  academics working outside the bounds of history, social or pure science
  departments. Yet, however technical and dry it seems, researchers
  working in methodology-driven disciplines know that valid methods aren’t
  a detail, but at the heart of the most important question to be asked of
  any study: can you trust the results?
  
  But while academics are under increasing pressure to promote and discuss
  their research findings in the media, they often face time-pressed
  reporters who know little about what it takes to conduct valid research.
  Sometimes, they seem to not want to know, given that knowledge that a
  piece of research is rubbish does them out of a story.
  
  The uncritical reporting of the Southern Cross Bioethics Institute’s
  launch of their report on abortion is a case in point. While the media
  widely reported the “findings” the Institute provided at their launch
  and via a summary on their website, journalists were not given
  information on the study’s conduct (how subjects were selected, the
  questions they were asked, the statistical tests used to crunch the
  numbers), and who funded it. Academics and activists attempting to do
  their homework before providing the media with requested commentary
  couldn’t get obtain such information either. When one activist asked,
  the PR consultants fielding enquiries initially promised it by email,
  only to renege later that day with a garbled excuse about only having
  permission to distribute the report - after payment via the website -
  through the post. A high-profile statistician who actually teaches
  research methods to university students was flatly refused a copy of the
  questions and told they wouldn’t be in the report either not to bother
  waiting by her mailbox, as the written report also didn’t reveal them.
  
  Despite this, the report claims to “reflect the attitudes to abortion of
  Australians generally”, though it fails to adequately explain why if
  this is so, the results are so discordant with polls by reputable
  institutions like the Australian National University, which does make
  its research questions and methods available for public scrutiny.
  
  The peer review process ensures that the value of data - and the
  conclusions drawn from it - are never taken at face value. A bottom-line
  requirement for the publication of academic articles and books is the
  provision of extensive information on how data was collected and
  crunched. Disclosure of who funded the research has, thankfully, become
  de rigour. This is because academics are trained to be sceptics, and are
  well aware of the biases that can be introduced through the way in which
  research is conduced and funded, not just how the results are analysed.
  
  Journalists are trained to be sceptics too, and the exercise of their
  critical faculties regularly protects the public from swallowing what
  those controlling the agenda want us to see and believe. During the US
  election, Australian journos reported extensively and well on the way
  “push-polling” conducted during the US election distorted the data
  produced. Yet as the Southern Cross Bioethics Institute saga makes
  clear, a lack of journalistic scepticism about what constitutes valid
  research - coupled with organisational competitiveness and tight
  deadlines - can have significant outcome for the nature and quality of
  public debate.
  
  How might things go better next time? Firstly, media academics and
  journalists need to debate amongst themselves, in peer-reviewed journals
  and magazines like the Walkley, the precise nature of their
  responsibilities when it comes to publicising research results. Is it
  the media’s role to assess the quality of data, and source the money
  behind it, before placing it before the public? Or is the provision of
  space for critical commentary on a study’s methods and findings all that
  can reasonably be required?
  
  For their part, academics must insist in their interactions with
  journalists that methodology does matter, and provide clear and
  convincing examples of why this is so. Journalists are in the business
  of asking questions. It’s not hard for them to understand that the way
  researchers ask them impacts on the responses they get. Nor should it be
  hard to convince them that data generated from surveys of large,
  randomly selected adults of all ages and both genders, is going to be
  more robust than that obtained from 12 elderly members of a church group
  plus their relatives and friends. This isn’t to say that the latter
  technique can’t be used, but that it can’t be used if the researcher
  wants to claim the results represent the views of all Australians.
  
  Academics must also develop and market short, on-site courses for media
  practitioners that elucidate the basic methodological requirements of
  good research, and the basic questions journalists must ask - and have
  answered - before any story goes to press or to air.

  By Virginia Haussegger, Allen & Unwin, $26.95
  
  It’s hard to read Virginia Haussegger, or to listen to her on radio - as
  she has been in the last week, plugging Wonder Woman - and not find
  yourself liking her. In particular, I admire her honesty. Since 2002,
  when she threw open the doors on her reproductive journey and its
  unwanted destination, Haussegger has never been anything less than
  forthright about the pain she feels over finding herself unintentionally
  childless.
  
  Haussegger’s ongoing personal journey both structures and animates
  Wonder Woman. In it, Haussegger tries to make sense of the “creeping
  non-choices” that led to the moment in the doctor’s surgery where she
  was briskly told she’d left her run to motherhood too late. The book
  also represents the author’s working through of her grief about missing
  out on motherhood, and her efforts to reconstruct a new imagined future,
  and identity, for herself as a woman without children.
  
  Haussegger writes movingly of the events leading up to the opinion piece
  that shook the world (then-Opinion editor Paul Austin nominated it as
  the piece published in recent years that generated the most response),
  and about the distress that can be found in unexpected places when
  life-long habits, like the carting of carefully labelled boxes full of
  journals and photos from city to city, are recognised as having been
  geared towards children who aren’t to be. Writes Haussegger:
  
  “When I was very young I was entranced by the few old photos we had of
  my mother and father when they were young…I desperately wanted to know
  what my mother was like when she was little…The fading photos gave some
  clues, as did the precious jewellery box my mother kept hidden
  away…Every piece held a story, every story I would demand to hear over
  and over again…Now at forty years old, I’ve built up a box of treasures
  of my own. I just don’t know who to show them to”.
  
  I cried at this line, which comes near the book’s end. The cleanness of
  the emotion a welcome relief from the turbulent confusion engendered by
  the preceding (and subsequent, as it turned out) text. Because while
  Haussegger it a wonderful raconteur, and demonstrates a clear gift for
  exploring emotions - her own and, through interview, those of others -
  she desperately lacks any capacity to think her way out of the complex
  problems she explores in Wonder Woman. Despite having read most seminal
  and popular feminist texts - from the Second Sex to the Female Eunich to
  Backlash - she clearly failed to absorb their central and most important
  message: that the personal is political. And without this understanding,
  or some structural framework to make sense of her experience and those
  of other women in terms other than those proffered by liberal
  individualism, Haussegger lacks the tools to extricate herself from the
  circular path of self-blame and DIY solutions that have characterised
  her journey, and to cut a clear path forward for her female readers.
  
  This is not to say that she does not, on rare occasions, allude to such
  politics and their potential for women’s liberation. Having begun the
  book with her familiar refrain that it’s “high time to re-think
  feminism’s messages and the \`have it all’ mantra that’s been thumped
  into the brains and parlance of post-feminist women”, Haussegger then
  tentatively contradicts the implications of this claim - that feminism
  needs a less ambitious message - with a one-line assertion that
  “encourag[ing] young women to lessen their expectations, rather than
  raise them by demanding more equity and support, is doomed”.
  
  But this theme quickly drops away, only to be briefly and somewhat
  incoherently resurrected in the book’s last few pages (I’m afraid I have
  no idea what the approvingly quoted Nicola Roxon means when she asserts
  that contemporary feminists must fight “to be ourselves”).
  
  And so we are left with the bizarre hypothesis that the real problem
  facing contemporary women is that feminists didn’t tell them they
  couldn’t have it all, rather than the fact that even in post-feminist
  times, they still can’t.
  
  The job of articulating this obvious truth was left to Shadow Health
  Minister Julia Gillard who launched the book at the National Press Club
  early this month. Gillard spoke eloquently of the need to move “beyond
  the lament” and to “go forward, to carve out more change and to do what
  we need to do now so [that the life of girls] is more full of real
  choice than that of today’s woman.”
  
  You said it, sister. The question is: why didn’t Haussegger?

  It’s been driving me crazy for years, but John Howard’s comments in
  Parliament early this week about the rectitude of mandatory detention
  and public support for it, tipped me over the edge. The time has come
  for some clarity in the minds of public figures and commentators about
  what public support for something does - and does not mean - in terms of
  morality.
  
  In fact, the Prime Minister was clearer than most. At least his
  assertion that the mandatory detention policy was both “right” and
  supported by Australians attempted to discriminate between the morally
  correct and the popularly acclaimed. Many commentators never get that
  far. At a public lecture at an esteemed university last year, I listened
  to a highly regarded intellectual give a speech in which she both
  bemoaned the Howard’s government’s failure to heed the majority when it
  came to the war in Iraq AND rolled her eyes about the ignorant
  immorality of the masses when it came to mandatory detention. In the
  first instance, mass support was used as evidence of moral rectitude. In
  the second, the lack of it was, too. You can’t have it both ways, I
  pointed out at question time. From her expression, it was clear the
  contradiction never crossed her mind.
  
  In the same way, shock-jocks and politicians dump on judges for
  sentences they deem to be “out of touch” with “community standards”, as
  if this misalignment was proof positive the judges got it wrong. Yet
  another demonstration of confusion amongst those who really ought to
  know better .
  
  The truth is that there is no necessary relationship between what’s
  popular and what’s right. At the end of the 1800s in the US, the
  majority supported slavery; this century most Afrikaners supported
  apartheid. Until relatively recently, in historical terms, many
  Australians gave the White Australia policy a tic.
  
  Why is confusion about what’s ethical, and what’s popular, so rife?
  Perhaps it’s to do with the importance to politicians of public opinion.
  If what matters - and according to some democratic theory anyway - what
  ought to matter to politicians is what the public thinks, than public
  opinion rightly becomes the arbiter of good and bad political behavior.
  From there, the equation of good political performance with good moral
  performance doesn’t require much slippage.
  
  Or maybe the belief, widely-spruiked by populist politicians, that
  “average Australians” score highly when it comes to common-sense
  morality is to blame. Since by definition, most of us are “average”
  Australians, this equates majority views with moral ones.
  
  Yet the truth is that public support for a policy indicates noting more
  than that most people like it. To gain an ethical seal of approval, the
  policy must conform to more abstract standards about decision-making
  wisdom, maximal utility or principles that crudely reduce to the golden
  rule and a steadfast commitment to never using others as a means to our
  ends.
  
  According to any such criteria, serious questions can be raised about
  the Prime Minister’s claim that the government’s approach to
  unauthorized arrivals is “right”. And following this, that he would be
  right to gag debate on the Private Member’s bills designed to make the
  policy more compassionate and fair.
  
  It’s hard to argue that a person of good character would permit others
  who’ve committed no crime - and have good odds of eventually being found
  to be a refugee - to be detained for lengthy periods or indefinitely.
  This makes the government’s migration policy problematic for those
  espousing Virtue Theory.
  
  Utilitarian ethicists are about weighing overall benefits against harms.
  Current migration policy was adopted to contain the claimed risks posed
  by large numbers of bogus asylum seekers, yet since its inception
  changed politics in the regional have seen such arrivals slow to a
  trickle. The cost to individual asylum seekers, however, remains vast
  and includes physical and mental health problems that in some cases lead
  to self-harm and - when it comes to children - what experts claim may be
  irreversible developmental damage. Negligible benefits and vast and
  significant harms: where’s the morality in that?
  
  Finally, at the heart of “do unto others” is a recognition of the human
  needs - and human rights - of others. Yet while the Government
  recognizes the human rights of Australians, detainees are treated as
  though they are less than fully human and therefore somehow deserving of
  the loss of dignity, justice and freedom they suffer. To put it simply,
  we have duties to these people - to honour their rights and of care -
  that we are failing to meet.
  
  So while it may not be popular to say it, I find little in ethical
  theory to persuade me that the Government’s policy of mandatory
  detention is right. If the Prime Minister believes otherwise, he should
  welcome debate on the issue, rather than attempt to gag it, as a chance
  to make his case.

  Male Trouble: Looking at Australian Masculinities, edited by Stephen
  Tomsen and Mike Donaldson, Pluto Press, $29.95pb, 254pp, 1 86403 121 2
  
  TEASE: In his introduction to this collection of academic essays about
  different aspects and types of contemporary Australian masculinity or,
  as the authors prefer, masculinities, R.W. Connell notes that: ‘It is
  now a familiar observation that notions of Australian identity have been
  entirely constructed around images of men.’
  
  This is a familiar observation. Another old chestnut that better sums up
  recent discussions of masculinity and men, including this book, is that
  masculinity is in ‘crisis’, and that, at least in part, the solution
  lies in ‘problematising’, ‘deconstructing’, ‘destablising’, and then
  ‘collapsing’ it. It’s all, as such language makes clear, terribly
  sociological and cultural studies in approach. Which is not beyond
  interest, once one swims beneath the dense disciplinary jargon to the
  ideas beneath.
  
  But I must be honest and say, as someone who has spent the last few
  months reading everything I can get my hands on about masculinity, that
  I have begun to feel somewhat downtrodden by the relentless negativity
  about all things male that seems to be the sine qua non of such research
  and ‘discourse’. Men, this collection argues, continue to ‘construct’
  their masculinity through the degradation of the female and homosexual;
  men pursue submissive wives using Internet sites that traffic poor women
  from the developing world; men murder men who insult their masculinity
  through homosexual advance to preserve their honour and self-respect;
  the ‘hyper-masculine’ male sporting body continues to dominate sports
  coverage, while the sexual objectification of the female sporting body
  continues unabated. And on it goes. I can only imagine the impact such a
  relentless list of ‘male troubles’ has on readers of the opposite sex.
  
  Interestingly, a more attentive reading of many of the chapters - each
  authored by academics from different institutions - reveals numerous
  possibilities for optimism. While some members of the Australian navy
  are doing their best to preserve the military as a place where dominant
  forms of masculinity are made, Katerina Agostino’s research reveals how
  others welcome women (though they often refuse to express their support
  for fear of being ‘deprived of their gender status as men’). In a
  chapter on the ‘masculinising institution’ of Aussie Rules, Nikki
  Wedgwood speaks of several young men who refuse to denigrate women or to
  use violence on the field to subordinate other males and so assert their
  manhood. Indeed, as Gary Dowsett wisely notes in his discussion of
  ‘Masculinity, (homo)sexuality and contemporary sexual politics’, some
  men are responding to the challenges social and economic changes have
  presented to male power and privilege:
  
  Of course, some men have not changed at all and others are too powerful
  to have to bother. But some sections of the male population have faced
  up squarely to the challenge of feminism and adjusted significantly. Not
  all men are unwilling to change, but the process of change is difficult,
  even when it is willingly pursued.
  
  Male Trouble seems to see itself as advancing the project of ‘reforming
  masculinities’ in two ways. Firstly, by contributing to recent public
  debates about ‘men, boys and masculinities’, and, secondly, by
  presenting cutting-edge social research to assist in the development of
  ‘agendas of change in arenas from health policy to family violence to
  primary education’. Taken on its own terms, it seems important to ask
  how well it accomplishes these tasks.
  
  I offer qualified ticks on both counts. As Connell notes, much public
  debate about men and masculinity is marred by reactionary ideas. The
  progressive outlook offered by the authors of this collection, who veer
  away from psychological explanations for ‘all the nasty things men do’
  and focus instead on ‘institutions, power relations, and social
  inequalities’, warms the chill of the current individualistic and
  biologically determinant political landscape. In particular, the use by
  most authors of the terms ‘hegemonic’ to preserve the hierarchies
  amongst men and resultant differences in masculinities was welcome.
  
  I did wish the authors had put more effort into making their arguments
  in plain English. This was the case firstly because, in several
  instances, I suspected that jargon was not functioning in its proper
  role as in-group shorthand, but, rather, obscuring a lack of analytical
  precision and depth. As well, if - as Connell seems to want -
  masculinity research is to impact on policy, lucid writing and material
  organisation is essential. Indeed, all readers, lay or academic, would
  have benefited from a standard format for each article in which the
  impetus for the work, and its place in the literature, its method,
  results and conclusions were all clearly laid out. Insofar as the
  collection makes no bones about being for academic audiences only, I
  would have preferred abstracts at the start of each piece and notes at
  the end of each chapter, rather than collected at the back of the book.
  
  The collection does provide some new and interesting research. I was
  particularly fascinated by Poynting, Noble and Tabar’s discussion of
  ‘Protest masculinity and Lebanese youth in western Sydney’. The authors
  present fascinating extracts from interviews with seven Lebanese youth,
  which show how ‘protest’ masculinities are formed through intersections
  of class, gender and ethnicity. Mike Donaldson’s chapter, ‘Studying up:
  the masculinity of the hegemonic’, looks at the lives of ruling-class
  men - a rarity in sociological research, which specialises in what one
  researcher called ‘taking notebook and conscience in hand and going
  slumming’ - in order to investigate the workings of power from another
  angle, and to explore ‘the extent to which men of great power have some
  insight into the mechanics of its influence’.

  Once upon of time there was a tribe called the Very Smarts. The Very
  Smarts lived on a island where they planted, tended and then harvested
  trees from which they carved beautiful and much-sought after canoes. But
  while the Very Smarts were wonderful craftspeople, they had neither the
  interest nor the acumen to distribute or profit from their work.
  Instead, completed canoes were rowed by the Very Smarts to the
  Teleporting tribe on the mainland. There the Teleporters would put the
  final touches on the canoe and, with the Very Smarts help, rate each
  canoe for quality.
  
  On the teleport home, the Very Smarts took care not to lose the
  parchment on which evidence of the rating was stamped. A high rating
  earned the boat builder status and power in the tribe, not to mention
  the tastiest morsels and best digs, while a low rating meant disgrace
  and despair. Once the Very Smarts were gone, the Teleporters got busy.
  The canoes were sold to highest bidder for a handsome profit, and then
  teleported to their new owners.
  
  And so it went, for as long as anyone could remember, until one day the
  Very Smarts discovered that they could teleport, too. And though it took
  awhile, some Very Smarts began wondering why they ought to allow the
  Teleporters to sell and distribute their highly prized canoes, now that
  they could do it themselves. But others Very Smarts were less sure. If
  the Teleporters didn’t rate their work, how would they know how to
  distribute social and material resources amongst the tribe?
  
  If you’ve been following the feisty debates on-line, in the press and in
  the scholarly literature about the impact of the internet on publishing,
  you’ll have no trouble recognising the Teleporters as the publishers of
  scholarly journals and the dilemma facing the Very Smarts as the same
  one confronting contemporary academics in an electronic age. To solve
  it, we need to look past the enthusiastic shouting of those championing
  an open access future, and rapid-fire press releases from publishing
  houses eager to assure us they’ve finally cracked a viable business
  model for the new age, and return to first principles. Ignoring how
  we’ve always done it and why, we need to ask the question: what is it
  that academics need from, and are trying to achieve with, scholarly
  publishing?
  
  The answer is relatively simple. Academics need timely and convenient
  access to the most up-to-date scholarship in their discipline and their
  discipline’s archives. They also want their own work published quickly
  and disseminated widely, and to be credited for their labour in ways
  that enable them to maintain their job, or even climb the ladder.
  
  The truth, though publishers don’t like to hear it, is that academics
  and universities hold most of the cards in the scholarly publishing
  game. This is not just because they do the research, write the papers
  and do the unpaid work required to provide quality assurance by
  reviewing the work of their peers. It is also because their primary
  objective is not to profit from the distribution of their work (like the
  Very Smarts, most currently earn little to nothing from the hard-copy
  and electronic distribution of their oeuvres), but to have it read and
  cited by others.
  
  In the new electronic age it is hard to see why the achievement of these
  goals requires the input of a professional publisher at all. Sure,
  publishers currently edit academic papers prior to publication which, in
  some instances, can be intensive and painstaking work. But while it has
  not been exploited much to date, the expertise to perform this task too
  also exists within the academic tribe, as clearly demonstrated by
  in-house university journals like Monash’s People and Place.
  
  In fact, the only power the electronic shake-out of scholarly
  communication has left to traditional publishers is that of quality
  control. In academia, publication in journals like Nature and Mind still
  open doors for those seeking grants or promotion. This is the Very
  Smarts problem: without the stamped parchment from the Teleporters, how
  will they compete for rewards?
  
  But the truth is that new technologies are already showing the way.
  Instead of relying on the publisher’s reputation as a quality indicator,
  scholars could rely on electronic citation counts: an indicator which is
  not currently but can be made blind to whether the site of first
  publication was an established journal, an institutional repository, or
  the author’s own website. As well, Google’s PageRank algorithm is just
  one of a number of automated methods that systematically aggregate the
  opinions of unknown individuals that shows promise as an indicator of
  quality.
  
  A return to first principles about what scholarly publication is all
  about, and what academics need from it, leads to the conclusion that in
  the new world of electronic communication the Very Smarts don’t need the
  Teleporters any more. What they need are new ways of harnessing in-house
  talents to access, disseminate and receive rewards for reporting on
  quality research results.

  There is no end in sight to the painful saga of the long-ago termination
  of a woman with a foetus diagnosed with dwarfism in 2000. Feeling it has
  no choice but to defend the principle of patient confidentiality, the
  Royal Women’s Hospital has decided to seek leave to appeal against the
  Victorian magistrate’s ruling at the end of last month. The ruling
  compels the hospital to hand over the medical records of the woman known
  to the public as Mrs X, despite that women’s persistent refusal to
  consent to their release.
  
  The board needs the records to investigate the professional conduct of
  the treating doctor. Should they find against him, he could be
  suspended, or lose his registration.
  
  Meanwhile, a woman continues to have one of the most private and painful
  episodes of her life - one that drove her to the brink of suicide -
  splashed across the pages of the newspapers to be discussed and
  dissected by strangers.
  
  The driver behind this tragic state of affairs is anti-choice National
  Party Senator Julian McGauran. McGauran’s zealous pursuit of the issue,
  first through the Coroner’s Court and now the Medical Practitioners
  Board, appears to be driven by a number of agendas.
  
  One is to raise public awareness of the dog’s breakfast of Victorian
  laws and court judgements that on the one hand defines abortion
  providers and aborting women as criminals, but on the other enable
  doctors to lawfully provide the procedure if they deem it “necessary” to
  preserve the woman’s physical or mental health.
  
  At the same time, the Crimes Act suggest the possibility that even
  “necessary” abortions may be illicit if they are done on a viable
  foetus. Such “child destruction” laws have never been tested in court.
  This means that the gestational age at which a foetus is considered to
  be capable of being born alive, or the conditions under which a viable
  foetus may be lawfully aborted is simply not known. When the mother’s
  life is at risk? Her physical or mental health in peril?
  
  The senator may hope that if he succeeds in having the Medical
  Practitioners Board sanction the doctor who did the abortion, he will be
  one step closer to the anti-choice dream of turning Victoria back to a
  state where the legislative view of abortion as a crime prevails over
  the judicial understanding of the procedure as a sometimes necessary
  health intervention.
  
  Indeed, McGauran may already have achieved this end - and more - no
  matter what decision the board ultimately makes. Since that fateful day
  in 2000, when a kind-hearted deeply ethical man with a long history of
  commitment to women’s health and autonomy decided - in consultation with
  colleagues, including a qualified psychiatrist who judged the woman
  acutely suicidal - to perform the abortion, his life has been hell, his
  job threatened, his career in tatters, his ability to defend himself
  impeded.
  
  There wouldn’t be an abortion service provider in the state, probably
  the country, unaware of his story and the lesson it holds for them: toe
  whatever line the anti-choice groups draw in the sand or pay the price.
  Indeed, since that termination in 2000, an increasingly defensive
  medical practice has left many Victorian women stranded at precisely the
  moment when they most need support: upon learning their foetus is
  stricken with a serious or lethal disorder. Having made the difficult
  decision to terminate, many are shocked to discover that the hospital
  that offered - may even have urged them to have - the ante-natal test
  that revealed the problem, won’t extend themselves to provide a timely
  abortion, or any abortion at all.
  
  McGauran isn’t the only one with a case to answer. The State Coroner is
  also to blame. Graeme Johnstone gave Mrs X’s records to the anti-choice
  senator before - seemingly realising his error - sealing them to all
  future petitioners, including the doctors trying to defend themselves
  against McGauran’s charges. Because one thing is clear. Without those
  records, the senator would never have been able to put the sort of
  complaint before the Medical Practitioners Board that it felt bound to
  investigate.
  
  But this doesn’t put the board in the clear. The Medical Practices Act
  makes clear that the board may dismiss complaints it judges to be
  “frivolous” or “vexatious”, as those words are ordinarily understood.
  The Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary of Law defines vexatious as “lacking a
  sufficient ground and serving only to annoy or harass when viewed
  objectively”. Whether or not this was his intent, McGuaran’s
  determination to see this case investigated, first by the coroner and
  then the Medical Practitioner’s Board, has harassed - not to mention
  distressed - not just the aborting woman and her doctor, but women and
  doctors who provide abortions more generally.
  
  If such behaviour doesn’t qualify as vexatious, I don’t know what does.
  It’s certainly highly unethical. What moral person uses others,
  particularly vulnerable others, solely as a means to their own ends?

  After the Party by Jesse Blackadder. Melbourne: Hardie Grant Books,
  2005.
  
  TEASE: Jesse Blackadder’s first novel is an exploration of the physical
  and eclectic social terrain of Byron Bay: Sydney-sider holiday escape
  and stopover de rigour for the backpacker set. It follows the chain of
  events set into motion by Zac’s near-death experience at a party given
  by the emotionally inscrutable Black Dragon. Over a three-week period,
  Zac, Black Dragon, her friend Madeline and Zac’s girlfriend Kate roam
  between Sydney and Byron, searching and ultimately discovering important
  truths critical to unlocking their true vocation or potential for love.
  
  Blackadder knows Byron well, though she is most successful in conveying
  its unique hippy cosmopolitan groove indirectly through the
  matter-of-fact way she describes some of its more bizarre denizens.
  Like, for instance, Pan and his half-feral cross-dressing band of male
  faeries who rescue Zac after a failed ocean suicide attempt. The
  following morning, Zac wakes to find himself in a house that is
  “single-handedly holding back the advance of the rainforest” near a
  make-shift dome enclosing “a solemn circle of seven men and women and a
  small, smoky fire”. Just then a man dressed as a woman in a gold
  cocktail gown and a pink feather boa, totters into view. “Yoo hoo! Pan!
  I’m late as usual. I lost my fucking eyelash on your fucking muddy path.
  When are you going to get a man to do some work about the place?”
  
  Less convincing are the over-wordy riffs about and to the place
  sprinkled liberally - and unnecessarily - throughout the text. Riffs
  that sometimes run for pages with lines like “Welcome to Byron Bay, so
  beautiful it will make you weep” and “You are the gazuumper on the dream
  home, the developer who buys the last of the breach front land.” I also
  grew to detest the subheadings scattered liberally through each chapter.
  At best, they unnecessarily foreshadowed events (like the one entitled
  “Foccacia” that keyed me into the fact that the next few paragraphs
  would contain someone eating one). At worst, they were eye-rollingly
  twee, like the “You Give Me Fever” one preceding Zac’s sweat-drenched
  awakening to a serous flu-like illness. Occasionally, a smug omnipotent
  narrator creeps into the third-person voice, begging the question of his
  or her identity and source of knowledge about the characters’ pasts and
  futures. For all such errors of judgement, I am more inclined to blame
  editor than author. It is the latter’s job to take risks, and the
  formers to indicate when these succeed and fail.
  
  And sometimes Blackadder’s risks do succeed. Throughout the book is the
  motif of the stalking hand of death whose needs must be satiated to
  balance the books of fate. When Zac evades death’s grasp in the early
  pages of the book, an aging whale succumbs instead, the mourning cries
  of its pod filling the ocean with sadness. Later, it is the life of a
  young girl whose story intersects with that of the mysterious Black
  Dragon that is snatched in the place of the new relationships, lives and
  possibilities that have emerged since the party. None too original, but
  Blackadder carries it off well, adding to After the Party’s cosmic
  beating-of-the-butterfly’s-wings theme of the interconnectedness of
  nature and those linked through the bonds of love.

  We should not further restrict women’s access to late abortions, writes
  Leslie Cannold. The charging of Dr Suman Sood for manslaughter and
  procuring an unlawful abortion in NSW is the first such prosecution in
  that state since 1971, though it was only seven years ago that two West
  Australian doctors were charged as criminals for providing terminations.
  Indeed, Australia has a long history of prosecuting women and doctors
  over abortions and, because of the consistent refusal of politicians to
  legislate progressively on the issue, common law rulings have had a
  profound impact on the development of abortion law.
  
  What might Sood’s prosecution - for terminating the pregnancy of a woman
  who was between 21 to 24 weeks pregnant - mean for the women of NSW and
  the nation? If found guilty, she could be jailed and deregistered,
  relieving women of the risks they were unknowingly assuming by placing
  themselves in the doctor’s care.
  
  But the DPP’s prosecutory strategy may also pose significant risks to
  Australian women’s reproductive autonomy and health. If successful, it
  will reaffirm the regulation of abortion under the Crimes, rather than
  the Health Act, and by so doing the potential criminality of abortion
  service providers and their patients. This reassertion of the
  quasi-illicit nature of the procedure will ensure that it continues to
  be surrounded by secrecy and stigma and, as a result, that women’s
  access to quality information and timely services suffers.
  
  It will also give a new millennium stamp of approval to the law’s
  patronising contempt of women’s capacity to make important moral
  decisions for themselves and by themselves, without judicial approval or
  medical oversight. Such a reconfirmation of women’s status as
  second-class citizens in need of patriarchal guidance could be felt
  across Australia. Not just because of the anti-choice rabidity of
  powerful players in the Howard Government, but because of its
  potentially persuasive effect on states with similar legal frameworks.
  Reconfirmation of the legal status quo in NSW, in other words, might
  lead other states, like Victoria, to affix fresh seals of approval on
  their existing abortion laws. A particular worry is that the Bracks
  Government, now modernising the criminal code, might leave Victoria’s
  archaic abortion statutes untouched.
  
  But it is the manslaughter charge that has the greatest potential to
  undermine women’s reproductive autonomy, although it may also offer the
  possibility of more ethical care for pregnant women. As usual, it is the
  small number of women seeking post–20-week terminations that are at
  greatest risk of a loss of dignity, quality of care or services all
  together. Figures suggest most women terminating later are responding to
  the diagnosis of serious foetal defects, including conditions that will
  lead the baby to suffer and die shortly after birth. Not surprisingly,
  some women and couples opt for termination as the most ethical option in
  such tragic, no-win circumstances.
  
  But what many people do not know is that women are finding it harder and
  harder to access post~~20-week terminations inside and outside of
  hospitals. Across the country, only a few clinics provide them.
  Increasing numbers of hospitals are refusing to offer any on religious
  grounds, while others have adopted time-consuming and secretive
  assessment processes that deliver verdicts~~ on unclear grounds - to
  women about their eligibility for services.
  
  In addition, most clinics and hospitals compel women to labour and give
  birth to their dead baby, despite clear and convincing evidence that in
  skilled hands, surgical termination improves women’s physical and mental
  outcomes.
  
  Unlike a surgical procedure, induction of labour carries the risk of a
  foetus being born alive. This is what happened in Sood’s case, and may
  account for the manslaughter charge. Of course, not all foetuses born
  alive are viable. A recent study of British and Irish birth outcomes
  found that of those born before 24 weeks, only 15 per cent left hospital
  and half of these had significant cognitive and neurological impairment.
  
  However, the low survive-and-thrive rate of infants at “threshold”
  viability does not change the moral and medical unacceptability of
  allowing foetuses to live, and possibly suffer through, the abortive
  procedure. If a guilty verdict in Sood’s case means that doctors will in
  future select procedures where this cannot happen, then women and their
  families - knowing they have acted to prevent suffering, not cause it -
  will benefit. What we can’t allow is medical practitioners using the
  manslaughter charge as another excuse to further tighten women’s access
  to post–20-week procedures. Nationally, the numbers of such procedures
  is small (about 4 per cent), but each one is a tale of heartache,
  ethical dilemma and considered moral decision-making by the only people
  with the information to know what’s necessary and right: the woman and,
  if she has one, her partner.
  
  Society must not tolerate rogue medical providers. But neither must we
  allow isolated cases to deprive women and couples of critical health
  care when they need it.

  Few academics would have slept through the long-running Australian
  history wars. Sparked by claims made by retired academic Keith
  Windshuttle that several prominent scholars - among them Henry Reynolds
  and Lyndall Ryan - misrepresented or falsified data in order fabricate a
  version of Aboriginal history consistent with pre-existing political
  agendas, the debate threw a sharp and very public spotlight on the
  fallibility of scholars and scholarly methods.
  
  Reynolds and Ryan, as well as multiple and eminent defenders, have done
  well to demolish the fabrication claim, and in doing so, provided the
  public with a rare and fascinating glimpse into fractious disagreement
  amongst historians about what constitutes valid historical method and
  interpretive truth.
  
  However, less certainty surrounded the treatment of their errors of
  attribution and referencing. Errors that Windshuttle claimed were at the
  heart of his assault on the veracity of the two historians’ claims.
  Eminent historian Stuart Macintyre, for example, saw Windshuttle’s
  identification of sources that did not “support what the historians
  reported [and] others [that did] not even exist” as “damaging,” while
  prize-winning historian Inga Clendinnen ultimately dismissed what she
  described as Ryan’s “multiple and consequential” referencing errors as
  “few, explicable and trivial”.
  
  The truth is that Reynolds and Ryan are human. This means that like all
  academics, it is likely they will err at some point in their career.
  That this is the case doesn’t necessarily make the consequences of such
  errors less serious, but it does go to motive, and thus critically bears
  on the way those mistakes should be judged and the legitimacy of
  proposed responses. The challenge for academics and those who judge them
  - usually other academics and the public at large - is to distinguish
  between honest mistakes, scholarly incompetence and various forms of
  academic criminality. Interestingly, while questions of motive are at
  the heart of public and institutional scrutiny of academic error, few
  professional codes or guidelines distinguish mistakes on the basis of
  intention or, indeed, anything else. Indeed, most discussions about
  proper academic conduct are addressed to students, with scholars seen as
  the enforcers - never the violators - of accepted codes.
  
  **Honest Mistakes**
  
  These are likely to be one-off errors, rather than part of a pattern.
  They also seem more explicable by human fallibility (a momentary lack of
  concentration, a transcription error in the publication process missed
  during the proofing process) than a deliberate attempt to deceive. An
  example might be a sole paragraph in an otherwise lengthy book lacking
  proper attribution by an academic with an otherwise unblemished record
  and a plausible story about how the footnote got lost.
  
  Punishment: None. The public shaming and unavoidable damage to
  reputation more than adequate.
  
  **Scholarly Incompetence**
  
  Here a pattern may exist (of paraphrasing without proper attribution or
  of footnotes referring to incorrect sources) but intention to steal, lie
  or otherwise deceive appears lacking. Instead, a plausible story can be
  told of note-taking or attribution practices where such errors seem
  likely, if not inevitable. Academics are culpable for failings resulting
  from incompetence because their consequences are damaging and
  unacceptable. However, such errors must be distinguished from those that
  result from immoral motives.
  
  Punishment: None, but remediation (retraining, counseling) necessary.
  
  **Academic Criminality**
  
  May be one-off, or part of a pattern of academic errors that includes
  plagiarism, falsification of experimental results or other data/sources
  and the use of knowingly false data to draw conclusions. Such
  wrongdoings may be compounded by the use of knowingly false results to
  earn rewards, like high-level publications or grants. What is shared by
  all academic acts of criminality is the intention by the scholar to
  commit them, or a post-haste knowledge they were committed without an
  attempt to rectify the error.
  
  Punishment: In addition to shaming through exposure of the crime to
  colleagues and the wider public, the academic criminal should be
  expelled from the scholarly community, losing grants, jobs and other
  positions of respect and trust.
  
  The bottom line is that not all academic mistakes are the same. Some are
  only human, with sympathy and forgiveness the only legitimate response.
  But when there is a pattern, evidence of intention to deceive or both,
  the public and the community of scholars must respond swiftly to
  rehabilitate the incompetent, and expel the incorrigible.

  Call Me Elizabeth: Wife, mother, escort A true story by Dawn Annandale
  (Time Warner 2005). Callgirl: Confessions of a double life by Jeanette
  Angell (Schwartz, 2005)
  
  TEASE: It’s a big year for books on prostitution, with Call Me Elizabeth
  and Callgirl only some of the volumes weighing down gender studies
  shelves across the nation. At the start of Callgirl Angell gives us an
  inkling as to the cause of the current obsession when she writes that
  “people look at me and get a little scared. I could be - I am - one of
  them. I am their sister, their neighbour, their girlfriend. I’m nobody’s
  idea of what a whore looks like. Maybe that’s why I’m scary. They want
  callgirls to be different, identifiable. That keeps them safe.”
  Thirty-five years after second-wave feminism and in the midst of rising
  divorce rates, declining fertility and increasing numbers of women
  willing and able - should a suitable male fail to appear - to go
  motherhood alone, many of us are confused not just about what women
  want, but who women really are. Exposes of the secret worlds of women
  who appear average or even respectable on the outside tantalises us with
  the prospect of finding out.
  
  In important ways, the stories of both women - one British, the other
  American - and the first-person narrative form in which they tell them,
  are strikingly similar. Women facing fiscal ruin from good-for-nothing
  men, and making peanuts in their day job, give into the lure of the
  $200USD or 125 pounds per hour pay rate for women willing to have sex
  with strangers. From their first encounter to the ongoing maintenance of
  their sanity, physical health and secrecy as they pursue their
  alternative career through long gruelling nights, both Call Me Elizabeth
  and Callgirl provide a straightforward and informative trek through the
  comforts, tedium and insult of selling one’s body for a living.
  
  But here’s where the similarities end. Call Me Elizabeth reads like one
  long mea culpa from the incarnated stereotype of a whore with the heart
  of gold. Annandale claims that the only reason she works as an escort is
  to save her children being “destabalised” by changes to home and school
  that would accompany the family’s financial ruin. For Annandale,
  prostitution is never anything but “exhausting, awful, degrading” but
  necessary for a woman with a drawerful of bills and an selfless
  commitment to doing whatever it takes to protect her family. Indeed, she
  desperate is Annandale for us to see her as a good mother that she not
  only repeats her family-oriented motives ad nauseum, but quotes others
  who understand her behaviourthis way. At the end of her first night with
  her driver Kevin, for example, she tells how he helped her out of the
  car and said something that stayed with her:
  
  [He] told me that he wished he had a mother like me, someone who had
  loved him in the way that I obviously loved my children. ‘Hold your head
  up, darlin’, you’re fuckin’ special, you are’. In contrast, Angell’s
  credentials as an academic sociologist lead her to attempt a more
  sophisticated analysis of prostitution, though with somewhat mixed
  success. In the early pages of the book, she pursues a
  prostitution-is-no-more-degrading-to-women-than-oppressive-low-paid-work
  and an all-sex-is-an-exchange-of-sorts line. Angell even suggests that
  her considerable sex drive and mastery at pleasuring others means her
  work offers a double bonus of sexual pleasure and pay. But by chapter 3
  this switches - with no explanation - to a more matter-of-fact
  understanding of prostitution as wearing, degrading and at times
  dangerous work that women only undertake because they desperately needs
  the cash. “The fact is,” writes Angell, “it was prostitution. You can
  dress it up however you’d like; but for me to tell myself that earning
  my living as a prostitute was a situation that couldn’t get any better
  was at best a little naïve. At worst a little delusional.” A callgirl,
  Angell tells us, gets about as much excitement out of a call as she does
  going out to the supermarket.
  
  I have no problem with the conclusion that prostitution is oppressive.
  Indeed, Angell’s blow-by-blow description of her clientele - some of
  whom manipulate, insult and even assault her - leaves little doubt as to
  how she arrived there. But I was left wondering how such a conclusion
  jived with her seeming rejection of classic feminist analysis of
  prostitution as degrading to women: a rejection she seems to transport
  into the undergraduate class she teaches on the history and sociology of
  prostitution. Or her assertion that prostitution ought to be legalised.
  And how do Angell’s repeated assertions that she’s “nobody’s idea of
  what a whore looks like” fit with her consistent line that any woman -
  our sisters, neighbours or girlfriends - could and may very well be
  callgirls? Add to this an exasperatingly posey and staccato prose style,
  and it seems unlikely those interested in a sustained and satisfying
  experiential exploration of prostitution will be satisfied with
  Callgirl.

  There’s only one thing I have to say about Queensland National’s Senator
  Barnaby Joyce. I hope he’s telling the truth.
  
  “About Tesltra?” you might ask. Or Voluntary Student Unionism, where
  Joyce has sworn to vote against any Coalition bills that will reduce
  student services. Or perhaps you think I’m referring to Joyce’s seeming
  willingness to block some aspects of the government’s proposed changes
  to industrial relations?
  
  Nope, my thoughts are somewhere else, though any confusion could be
  forgiven. The extensive media coverage of Joyce (including somewhere
  around 1297 articles since his election including at least 25 profiles)
  has focused almost exclusively on Joyce’s publicly stated position on
  these issues to the exclusion of his repeated assertions on a subject of
  similar - if not greater - importance to the 50% of Australians not
  currently running the world. That subject is abortion.
  
  My fervent hope - prayer really - that Joyce will be as good as his word
  refers to the Senator’s hand-on-heart pledge that he would never
  horse-trade his vote on other issues to secure concessions on abortion
  laws or funding. Or so he told intrepid Fairfax journalist Misha
  Schubert who diligently relayed his comments in a recent news item
  mainly concerned with the recent scuttling by anti-choice MPs (Joyce
  amongst them) of a routine parliamentary motion reaffirming Australia’s
  backing for reproductive health services in developing nations.
  
  Those with a good grasp of recent political history will know why
  supporters of reproductive choice are so anxious about Joyce’s
  veritableness. They will remember the backroom deal struck by both major
  political parties with anti-choice Senator Brian Harradine in 1996 to
  ensure his vote for the partial privitisation of Telstra. In exchange,
  and to their eternal shame, both Labor and the Coalition voted with the
  Tasmanian Senator to effectively ban Australian women from accessing a
  drug called mifepristone or RU486 by requiring the Health Minister to
  personally approve the importation, evaluation, registration and listing
  of the drug and to table that approval in parliament.
  
  Of course, the effective banning of mifepristone has not only denied
  women access to a safe effective non-surgical method of abortion able to
  be used the moment an unwanted pregnancy is discovered (surgical
  terminations can not be done before the 5th or 6th week of pregnancy).
  It has also led women needing emergency contraception with fewer
  side-effects, and women seeking an effective method of oestrogen-free
  contraception to miss out. As well, the ban has left patients with
  breast cancer, prostate cancer, inoperable meningiomas and Cushing’s
  Syndrome in the lurch. Indeed, so important is mifepristone to
  Australian patients in general, and female patients in particular, that
  the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and
  Gynaecologists recently called on the government to review the drug’s
  availability. A call the anti-choice Health Minister Tony Abbott seems
  destined to ignore. Indeed, prior to Joyce’s capitulation on Telstra,
  defenders of reproductive freedom were aghast at the possibility that
  yet another Senator who preached justice and fairness would trade their
  vote on the telco for a policy outcome that ignores just those values
  where women are concerned.
  
  Of course, Harradine was a wily and experienced legislator who knew
  precisely how to wield his power for the tiny communities he represented
  at the expense of the less ably-represented majority. But Joyce is no
  dolt either. At least not according to Professor Brian Costa, a
  political scientist at Swinburne, who describes him as a “quite
  well-educated, articulate, smart operator”. And Senator Joyce is firmly
  opposed to women’s reproductive freedom. Having told a Right to Life
  Conference in July that his greatest goal in public life was to ban “the
  unfortunate carnage” of abortion, he used his first speech in parliament
  to identify abortion as the “slavery debate of our time”.
  
  And while the full sale of Telstra is a done deal, the danger for
  Australian women has not passed. Throughout the entire term of this
  Howard government Joyce’s vote will be needed to achieve the
  government’s legislative agenda. As each piece of legislation goes
  before the party room ~~- to ban compulsory student unionism,
  reconfigure industrial relations, revamp the tax system~~ Joyce will be
  there, demanding a pound of flesh for his support.
  
  The only question is whose flesh will be for sale?

  “Paternity Fraud” implies deceptive women cuckholding men into believing
  children are biologically theirs. But the truth is more complex, and
  more human.
  
  While the DNA paternity test has been around since the early 1980s, it
  was not until the mid–1990s that the moral panic about what father’s
  rights activists call “paternity fraud” took flight in Australia.
  Instigated by the Child Support (Assessment) Act of 1989, the Act
  effectively transformed the age-old definition of a father: from the man
  married to a child’s biological mother, to the man whose sperm caused
  the child to be conceived. Designed to compel men to take fiscal
  responsibility for the fruit of their loins, the new law was lauded by
  politicians as a boon to both women and children.
  
  Overnight, the new law changed the world for separated and divorced men.
  While previous support arrangements had largely left such men in control
  of decisions about whether and to what extent they would provide
  financial support for the children of failed relationships ~~60% to 70%
  found it easy to evade court-ordered maintenance and pay nothing~~ the
  new act used set formulas to assign child support liabilities that could
  be automatically deducted from a man’s salary or from his bank account.
  
  The only recourse for men hoping to escape what one commentator
  sympathetic to the Father’s Rights cause recently referred to as the
  “clutches” of the Child Support Agency is to disprove biological
  paternity. So, perhaps not surprisingly, the Act’s passage saw DNA labs
  bloom across the commercial landscape like desert flowers, marketing
  paternal anxiety to men and promising “peace of mind” from between $150
  to $825 (if you want the results to stand up in court). By early 2000,
  Father’s Rights Groups were insisting on the basis of discredited or
  even non-existent data sets that between 10 to 30% of Australian
  children were being parented by men who were not the biological father,
  and viciously attacking academics - like Swinburne’s Professor Michael
  Gilding - who tried to set the record straight (Gilding’s published
  results showing the Australian rate is likely to be between 1 and 3%).
  
  The Australian face of paternity fraud is Melbourne man Liam Magill. In
  2002, Magill’s ex-wife Meredith was ordered to pay him $70,000 for
  general damages and the economic loss he suffered as a consequence of
  her false declaration that he was, as one newspaper report put it, the
  biological father of “her lover’s children”. The case continues to fight
  its way through the courts, with the High Court of Australia last week
  granting Mr Magill leave to contest the Victorian Supreme Court’s
  reversal of his victory and continue his case for compensation. But,
  however the highest court in the land ultimately rules, Magill’s
  predicament - and the anxieties of fathers over legally intertwined
  questions of biological paternity and fiscal responsibility - have had a
  profound impact on government policy. In June this year, the
  Attorney-General Philip Ruddock amended the Family Law Act to make it
  easier for men to reclaim child maintenance or property transferred to a
  child that DNA testing reveals isn’t really “theirs”. Around the same
  time, the Government took delivery of what has become known as the
  Parkinson report which recommends that men disputing biological
  paternity be allowed to suspend child support payments for as long as it
  takes to resolve the issue.
  
  It is men - or what President of the Australian Law Reform Commission
  Professor David Weisbrot calls “putative” and “angry dads’ - that
  dominate debates about child support and paternity fraud. While their
  bitter denunciations of women who”cheat and lie" echo through
  cyber-space, in real life such men contribute the bulk of submissions to
  the ALRC’s recent inquiry into the privacy of genetic information and,
  through their endless complaints to local MPs, instigate inquires like
  the 2003 one into child custody arrangements that ultimately led to the
  Parkinson report. The voices of children and women are rarely heard.
  Indeed, even in the wake of her victory in the Victorian Supreme Court,
  Meredith Magill refused to grant interviews to any of the assembled
  reporters.
  
  The work of Dr Lyn Turney, a researcher at Swinburne, suggests that this
  is not surprising. Turney’s groundbreaking research on women who keep
  “paternity secrets,” which appeared in the most recent issue of the
  Journal of Family Studies, argues that the panic surrounding paternity
  fraud paints mothers as the central “moral threat” to social stability.
  Charged as sexual deviants for the dual “crimes” of infidelity and
  sluttishly having more than one partner - while posing in the community
  as “good” wives and mothers - the behaviour of such women is depicted as
  morally indefensible. Says Turney: “They encapsulate not only female
  sexuality out of control but also a view of women as predatory,
  deceptive, and instrumental”. No wonder they don’t want to stick their
  heads above the parapet.
  
  But Turney wanted to know more. In particular, what led women to have
  and to keep “paternity secrets”? Her results, the outcome of interviews
  with 15 Australian women, are testament to the stubborn opacity of
  conception, the complexity of human relationships and the way in which
  both shame and violence shape women’s sexual and reproductive lives.
  
  As it turns out, Kathleen Donnelly, the past girlfriend of Health
  Minister Tony Abbott who publicly - and mistakenly - declared him the
  father of their long-ago adopted son, is not the only Australian woman
  to be confused about the genetic paternity of her offspring. In Turney’s
  sample, a number of women admitted to uncertainty about which man was
  the genetic father of their child.
  
  But few of these women’s stories conformed to the “paternity fraud”
  stereotype of faithless wives with regular lovers. Instead, the women
  Turney interviewed told of sexual relationships that “overlapped” or
  happened “in quick succession,” as well as “one-off” encounters with
  friends, acquaintance and old-flames that usually didn’t involve either
  infidelity or deception because the women were either unattached or only
  “minimally attached” to a dying, old or embryonic relationship at the
  time. One woman, for example, had unplanned sex with a long-time friend:
  her first encounter after the death of her husband a year earlier.
  Several days later, she met a new man who became her regular partner.
  Another woman told of a single sexual liaison with an old flame while
  single and trying to conceive a child with a known-donor. Both of these
  women, as well as others to whom Turney spoke, had dismissed the
  reproductive potential of these one-off encounters because they wanted
  to believe that their chosen or permanent partner - the one with whom
  they were having regular unprotected sex - was the genetic father. It
  was only when the baby bore a similarity to the biological father at
  birth, or the woman later happened upon a childhood photograph of the
  biological father, that the connection was made and the biological
  realities of the situation accepted.
  
  The threat of sexual violence or shaming also explains a number of cases
  of “paternity fraud”. Several women, some of whom confessed
  stomach-turning tales of rape and abuse, withheld doubts about their
  child’s paternity for fear of their partners’ response. One woman told
  of being raped by a family friend and, believing herself to be at fault
  because she “trusted him”, never told anyone of the assault or her
  subsequent doubts about paternity.
  
  Turney also cites several instances where older domineering husbands
  organized sexual liaisons - in the context of an “open marriage” and
  plenty of drugs and alcohol - in which their wives participated. When
  the women subsequently raised questions about the paternity of resulting
  children, the husbands “muted” the discussion by “highlighting the
  women’s…sexual transgressions” and threatening them with public
  disclosure. Such men “drew upon the moral panic,” in other words, to
  stop the woman revealing the secret about the child’s paternity not to
  the social father - who knew exactly what was going on - but to society
  at large. Only when the relationship broke down, and the question of
  support payments arose, did the men question the child’s biological
  paternity.
  
  Abortion was considered by several women unsure about which man caused
  their pregnancy, but the men in their lives were not always supportive.
  The Catholic step-father of a 16 year-old told her he would never speak
  to her again if she had an abortion, while a GP to whom another woman
  confessed her lack of paternity certainty counselled her to “go ahead
  with the pregnancy and see what happens”. In one instance, the
  suggestion of abortion triggered an angry response from the woman’s
  partner because she was threatening to “kill [a] baby that was probably
  his”.
  
  The knowledge that some “defrauded” dads have about women’s paternity
  “secrets’ is perhaps the most important - and surprising - of Turney’s
  findings. From the wife-swapping husband, to the abortion-opposing
  partner, to the spouse who knew his wife had conceived during a short
  break in their relationship yet nonetheless chose to sign the birth
  registration papers and act in the role of the child’s father, Turney
  exposes a range of scenarios where the word”fraud" poorly describe what
  the men involved describe as the problem they face, if indeed they
  define their situation as problematic at all. For one man, the issue was
  that his partner was unfaithful, not that the resulting child wasn’t
  biologically “his”. However, in explaining his refusal to have a
  paternity test, the ex-partner of another woman said that while he was
  “over the fact the [she had] slept with some else,” he hadn’t come to
  terms with the potential genetic consequences of her actions.
  
  Indeed, Turney’s revelation that some men know there are doubts about
  their children’s genetic lineage or even that their children are
  definitely not biologically “theirs” bolsters suggestions - rife in the
  academic literature - that relationship breakdown is an important
  trigger to men’s (and consequently society’s) reworking of paternity
  “secrets” into the moral crime of paternity “fraud.” It also hints at
  the unsavory possibility, vehemently rejected by Father’s Rights groups,
  that at least some men are motivated to test - in the wake of marital
  breakdown - to escape child support liabilities.
  
  The take home message of Turney’s research is simple, yet consistently
  overlooked in debates about paternity fraud. That human values, motives
  and relationships come in a myriad of complex - even convoluted - forms.
  “Oh, what a tangled web we weave”, I wanted to sigh as each woman’s tale
  - with its coercion and choice, misunderstanding and deception, care and
  indifference - unfolded. I also found Turney’s work suggestive of a
  number of ways the problem of paternity fraud could be understood, and
  fixed.
  
  What is clear is that it is a nonsense to brand all instances in which
  men receive paternity test results showing they are not a child’s
  biological father as cases of “paternity fraud”. As Turney’s research
  shows, such results may - or may not - be telling the man something he
  didn’t know already. Fraud implies deceit and if men know there is doubt
  about a child’s genetic paternity or are sure a child is not their
  biological progeny - and have supported the pregnancy continuing (for
  instance, by opposing an abortion) - then it is simply incorrect to
  claim that they have duped either about their partner’s fidelity or into
  accepting legal responsibility for the child.
  
  By definition, a victim of fraud is someone who has been injured, or at
  least disadvantaged. To be defrauded is to be cheated of something that
  is rightfully yours. Indeed, the claim that “real” Dads are genetic
  ones, and therefore that men who discover they are not the progenitor of
  the child they are parenting have been cheated of fatherhood, is at the
  heart of Father’s Rights Groups claims about the wrongs suffered by
  victims of paternity fraud. Yet, research evidence, not to mention the
  decisions of millions of men to adopt children or conceive them using
  donor sperm, suggest that many men see the essence of fatherhood as
  parenting, not sperm-donation. For them, the “real” father is the one
  who is “there” not at the time of conception, but for the joys and hard
  work of parenting.
  
  Of course, many - if not most - men want to be both the genetic and the
  social father of their child. Were this not the case, chastity belts
  would never have been invented, nor the debilitating laws and attitudes
  that until recently condemned “unwed mothers” and their “bastard”
  children to legal and social non-personhood. When women keep paternity
  secrets, they deprive men of the knowledge that would instigate an
  exploration of their values regarding social and genetic fatherhood, and
  the chance to make partnering and parenting choices based on those
  values. Paternity secrets deprive men of the chance to say “thanks but
  no thanks” to an offer of social, but not biological, fatherhood.
  
  All this cashes out to a definition of the problem that focuses on the
  abuse of trust caused by infidelity and subsequent deception about the
  infidelity, and the consequent denial to men of the chance to make
  informed decisions about partnering and parenting. Such a definition
  does not make the parenting of an unrelated child a quandary in and of
  itself, but only one in the context of a lack of female honesty and
  informed decision-making by the man. The difficulty is not the return of
  DNA results that show a social father is not a biological one, but the
  return of such results to a man who did not know there was any doubt
  about his partner’s sexual fidelity and his genetic paternity. The
  trouble is the discrepancy between what men believe is the case about
  their partner’s fidelity and genetic paternity, and the reality. The
  problem isn’t paternity fraud. The problem is paternal discrepancy.
  
  What all this should make clear is that the current child support
  payment system, which assigns payment obligations on the basis of
  biological paternity, not parenting commitment, is tragically flawed.
  Regardless of whether or not he suspected, knew or had no idea that the
  child he was parenting was genetically unrelated, and notwithstanding
  however culpable his female partner’s behavior was in creating that
  situation, the law needs to recognize and affirm men’s value to children
  as parents - and people - not sperm donors. Playing the biological card
  not only undercuts research findings that affirm the importance to
  children of having an active male parent in their lives, but lends
  support to the insulting claim made by a sperm donor interviewed on Four
  Corners last month that he, not the man who invested 20 years of time
  and love, was his daughter’s “real” father.
  
  Ditto for recent suggestions that DNA paternity testing ought to be made
  compulsory at birth. Turney’s research makes it easy to imagine the man
  who suspects or even knows that his new bundle of joy is not a
  biological relation compelled to face a doctor or nurse delivering the
  “negative” results of a mandatory paternity test. How likely is such a
  man to admit to knowing and not caring about the sexual and biological
  realities surrounding his child’s conception if he feels this will brand
  him as cuckold and a mug? Better, he may feel, to beat his chest, cry
  foul and walk out on his wife and new baby.
  
  Of course, rejecting mandatory paternity testing at birth does not mean
  that men should not be assisted to accept the obligations of fatherhood
  in a more informed way. Upon the birth of a child, men ought to be given
  the opportunity to give one-time-only non-rescindable consent to their
  acceptance of the rights and responsibilities of fatherhood. If they
  feel unable to sign on the dotted line without conclusive proof that
  they are the biological progenitor, they should be offered a DNA test
  free of charge.
  
  However, once a man does formally accept social and legal responsibility
  for a child - either with knowledge of their genetic paternity or in the
  face of a fully informed waiver of that knowledge - their status as the
  child’s legal father should rightly be set in stone. No DNA skeletons
  rattling out of the cupboards at a later date should impact on what they
  legally owe their child, or hopefully, how they feel about the kid who
  calls him Dad.

  TEASE: Motherhood is the latest in a long line of cri de coeur books by
  baby-boom women about what is claimed to be the incompatibility of
  “feminist” ideas about motherhood and female emancipation and their
  lived experience of motherhood. Like Manne, such authors breathed
  feminist assumptions - about the equality of men’s and women’s talents,
  women’s need for economic independence and human flourishing - “as
  naturally as air”. But when their children are born, such women find
  they conflict with the way they want to mother (or as Manne prefers, the
  way children need them to mother).
  
  At the heart of Motherhood’s claim to know what children really need and
  what therefore, according to the logic of such texts, mothers are
  morally compelled to provide is Manne’s preternatural insight into the
  emotional life of pre-verbal children: her own and other women’s.
  Motherhood is replete with anecdotes about the mothers that breezily
  assert the acceptability of their care arrangements when Manne - having
  sized the situation up in less than a minute - knows better. “One
  friend”, she reveals, “put her baby into full-time care when the baby
  was nine months old. Meeting me in the street, she anxiously assured me
  that the baby was \`quite happy’ in care. But the baby told a different
  story. When the caregiver’s name was mentioned, she put her arms around
  her mother’s neck, and with look of indescribable sadness, laid her head
  down on her mother’s shoulder.”
  
  Manne offers “maternal feminism” as a cutting-edge framework for
  resolving these issues rather than a theoretical relic of the 1980s
  impossibly encumbered by the same problems of regressive essentialism
  that plague Motherhood. Indeed, the book’s key take-home message is that
  the relationship between mothers and babies can not be “replaced” by
  paternal or other sorts of care. Perhaps because even the selective
  reporting of research findings that she uses to such great effect
  elsewhere won’t work to support this claim, Manne relies on anecdote and
  the views of a famous Australian cartoonist, to make her case. She tells
  of arriving home early from the library to hear her daughter crying: “”I
  rushed in to find my husband…trying to soothe her. When I picked her up
  she turned her head towards my shoulder. She took a long, deep,
  suspicious sniff, turned her head to one side, smiled and fell asleep.
  She smelt her mother."
  
  Having approvingly cited Leunig’s take on attachment theory, Manne
  somewhat incoherently presents an anecdote about the inadequacies of
  grandparental to make her case against institutional childcare: “A
  perceptive grandmother, an exceptionally sensitive caregiver, who looked
  after her two little grandchildren full-time while the mother worked,
  once told of the oldest stopping deal in the middle of play and suddenly
  crying out for her mother’s face. \`Where’s that dear face? Where is
  it?’’”
  
  It is worth pausing here to ask some questions about the implied moral
  of this story: that if a child ever misses her Mum the mother’s absence
  is wronging the child and must be remedied. Is the pain of missing a
  beloved other than a mother good enough reason to change care
  arrangements too? Some babies cry whenever their mothers step into the
  shower, or attempt to go to the toilet or the doctor alone. Must good
  mothers abandon such solitary journeys? If the baby misses Dad at work
  or a sibling at school, must they also be tethered to home? Indeed, if
  we ignore the implications of Manne’s arguments and accept her claim to
  believe in the capacity of children to attach to both their fathers and
  mothers, doesn’t the “missing as tragedy” argument imply that what
  children need is 24/7 access to both parents?
  
  But absent scholarship and faulty logic are only some of the problems
  plaguing Motherhood. The others reduce to honesty and integrity.
  Motherhood is a polemic that has nothing to do with “moving beyond the
  motherwars”, and everything to do with championing the at-home mother as
  the good one. Her advice to women confronting work/life dilemmas? You
  can have it all, but “in sequence”, not “all at once”.
  
  More disturbingly, Manne mischaracterizes key thinkers and important
  debates. She claims that feminist Eva Cox said at-home mothers raise
  “narcissistic monsters incapable of sharing”, when a quick internet trip
  to the Boyer lectures reveals the complete lack of fit between this
  description and Cox’s far more temperate point. Manne asserts that a
  2002 study by a university student claiming bad outcomes for small
  children spending long hours in daycare was “attacked on every media
  outlet”. However, a review of the print media during this period reveals
  that while news items were either slanted in favour of the study or were
  balanced, 7 of the 8 opinion pieces lavishly praised the study and
  castigated its mythical critics. The one exception was a piece by the
  head of the Australian Institute of Family Studies refuting the claims
  of columnist Bettina Arndt that because one of his expert staff
  questioned the validity of the study’s methodology, she and the entire
  Institute were guilty of left-wing bias.
  
  The publication of Motherhood will ensure Manne’s views continue to
  feature in debates on work/life balance and childcare. We can only hope
  it influence the weight and credibility they are accorded as well.

  TEASE: For those who have been watching the debate about RU486, this
  coming Tuesday is the moment of truth. That’s because Tuesday is the day
  the Coalition party room meets to discuss whether they will support or
  oppose a promised Democrat’s amendment to the Therapeutic Goods Act that
  will lift what has effectively been a ban on the “abortion pill” in
  Australia.
  
  The Prime Minister has hinted that he will offer his colleagues a
  conscience vote on the issue. This is the route Federal Labour has
  already adopted to deal with longstanding and trenchant internal
  divisions in the party around women’s reproductive freedom.
  
  But a conscience vote sends all the wrong messages to Parliamentarians
  and to the electorate about the nature of the vote on RU 486. It asserts
  that the vote is about the moral or legal legitimacy of abortion. Yet
  this could not be further from the truth. In reality, this is a vote
  about the integrity of Australia’s framework for ensuing the quality,
  safety and efficacy of the medicines we ingest and give to our children.
  It is a vote about whether or not the TGA, or the Health Minister, ought
  to be making critical decision about which pharmaceuticals are made
  available to Australian patients, and in what circumstances.
  
  To understand why, a short history of the offending amendments is
  necessary. Passed in 1996 with the agreement of both major parties, the
  amendments were designed by their author - anti-choice Senator Harradine
  - to forever deny Australian women access to RU 486 and any other
  pharmaceutical capable of inducing a non-surgical abortion. Having made
  the specious claim that the rigorous quality, safety and efficacy
  analysis the TGA does for all pharmaceuticals entering Australia was
  inadequate for these drugs - and these drugs alone - the Harradine
  amendments require the Health Minister to approve in writing the
  importation, trial, registration or listing of such drugs, and to table
  that approval in parliament. In exchange for this warped
  dream-come-true, Senator Harradine horse-traded his vote to privatise
  Telstra.
  
  Of course, the drover’s dog could work out that the Harradine amendments
  virtually guaranteed that no company would attempt to market the drug in
  Australia. Registering drugs with the TGA is time-consuming and
  expensive. No manufacturer with any sense would bankroll it knowing that
  even if they successfully demonstrate that the drug is both safe and
  effective the Health Minister could still - without even needing to
  explain why - refuse to permit Australian patients to access it.
  
  The contempt both political parties showed for Australian women and
  patients in passing the Harradine amendments - and continue to
  demonstrate by refusing to join hands to remove them - is breathtaking.
  RU486 is used in the treatment of life-threatening conditions like
  Cushings Syndrome, inoperable brain tumours, HIV/AIDS, ovarian and some
  breast cancers. Yet, by and large, Australians with such
  life-threatening conditions miss out or are forced to cope with
  intolerable delays. The hypocrisy of anti-choice players in this drama
  also deserves mention. Mifepristone enables women to abort very early in
  pregnancy - indeed, the moment they know they are pregnant while six
  weeks is the earliest a woman can have a surgical abortion. However,
  despite opponents of choice expressing particular concern about the
  “tragedy” of “late” abortions, they have worked tirelessly since 1998 to
  effectively ban Mifepristone, and to keep it banned.
  
  In a strange way, the anti-choice Health Minister’s unprofessional
  behaviour in commissioning the Chief Medical Officer to provide what
  Liberal colleague Mal Washer called “lightweight” answers to “stupid
  questions” about the drug’s safety has exposed the way the Harradine
  amendments twist the proper, impartial, evidence-based processes that
  Parliament - through the TGA - put in place to ensure Australians gained
  timely access to good pharmaceuticals and were protected from the bad.
  Tony Abbotts’s behaviour, in other words, has clearly demonstrated why
  properly resourced experts on the basis of the evidence, not a single
  individual with an axe to grind, should rule on what drugs should be
  made available to Australian patients.
  
  The right thing for the Government, and the Opposition to do, would be
  to admit the terrible mistake they made close to a decade ago in backing
  the Harradine amendments, and make amends to those injured by their
  expedient mistake by voting together - along party lines - to remove
  them from the TGA.
  
  There wasn’t any conscience vote to enact the amendments. Balance and
  justice suggest there shouldn’t be one to remove them either.

  TEASE: It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas, but those who’d
  hoped the giving spirit might have affected the Prime Minister when it
  came to the abortion drug RU 486 have found their stockings sadly empty.
  On Tuesday, the Prime Minister emerged from a Liberal party room meeting
  to inform the media that the vote expected by the end of next week was
  cancelled. The Coalition’s pre-Christmas legislative agenda was crowded
  with issues far more important than women’s health. Those hoping to find
  out whether Australian patients will finally get access to a
  pharmaceutical that doesn’t just terminate very early pregnancies, but
  is used in the treatment of breast cancer and endometriosis, would just
  have to wait.
  
  But the truth is that if the PM had strongly defined what the vote was
  really about - and insisted the Coalition take a principled stand on the
  issue - the vote could have been wrapped up in less than an hour. The
  vote was never about abortion, or even the safety or effectiveness of RU
  486. It was about who should decide if RU 486 is safe and effective
  enough to be marketed in Australia: the Health Minister or the
  Therapeutics Goods Administration. This no-brainer of a question is
  essentially one about good governance. How worrying that the Prime
  Minister determined his colleagues needed the entire holiday period to
  consider their answer, and a conscience vote on the issue when they
  return to work 2006.
  
  So how are events likely to play out next year? John Howard has promised
  a conscience vote, but whether it will take place on a Democrats
  amendment to the Therapeutic Goods Act (TGA), or a Private Member’s Bill
  facilitated by the Government, no one can say. All power lies with the
  Prime Minister. If the Government moves its own amendments to the TGA,
  this will give the Democrats the chance to initiate a vote on the ban.
  Alternately, the Government can facilitate a Private Member’s bill
  mooting the necessary changes to the TGA.
  
  A private member’s bill in the new year carries significant risks for
  supporters of women’s health and freedom. Having successfully delayed
  the vote, the large coterie of anti-choice government ministers who
  surround the Prime Minister may now be hoping to convince him that they
  need a private member’s bill, too. Say, one that bans Medicare funding
  for abortion, or mandates that women “cool off” for 2 days before being
  eligible to claim the abortion rebate. If such proposals sound extreme
  or unlikely, guess again. Both have been floated in the last few years
  by prominent members of the Coalition government, and have the support
  of key members of the Labor party.
  
  Supporters of the ban are also pushing the PM to set up an inquiry into
  the drug’s safety. Hmmm, good idea. What about letting the TGA do it?
  Indeed, a research note published this week by the federal parliamentary
  library service, which provides neutral information, analysis and advice
  to MPs, points out that the TGA is precisely the right agency to
  undertake such an evaluation as it is explicitly charged with evaluating
  and managing the risks associated with pharmaceuticals. The note’s
  author points out that “The TGA is regarded by the government as being
  qualified to manage the risks associated with any therapeutic good that
  is used (or proposed for use) in Australia…[Why shouldn’t one]
  reasonably assume that it is also qualified to manage the risks
  associated with abortifacients such as RU486”?
  
  So what can those with a penchant for good governance and a distaste for
  political interference into the private decisions citizens make about
  their lives and health do to restore the integrity of the TGA’s drug
  evaluation framework and to lift the ban on RU486?
  
  The simple answer is to make more noise. The Government’s TGA bill
  remains on their legislative agenda for this parliamentary session. The
  Prime Minister must be urged to bring the bill on and to allow a vote on
  the Democrat’s amendment before the holiday break. And if a Private
  Member’s bill early next year is the best he can do, the unfairness of
  any tit-for-tat offerings to supporters of the ban must be made clear..
  
  Having achieved their aim of delaying the bill, they’ve had their
  Christmas present already.

  What woman would want to have an unsafe, illegal abortion when she could
  have a safe and legal one? Health minister Tony Abbott (Opinion, 6/2)
  claims to be worried that making RU486 available in Australia would lead
  to backyard miscarriages and an internet-based black market.
  
  Yet Australian history tells us that making abortion illegal doesn’t
  stop women having abortions, it just increases the risks they take doing
  so. If he really wanted to avoid backyard abortion and a black markert
  internet trade, the minister should do all he can to ensure medical
  abortion with RU486 is done in the front yard. He and his colleagues
  should vote yes so that the drug can be properly evaluated and
  regulated.

  As I write, the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (Repeal of Ministerial
  Responsibility for Approval of RU86) Bill 2005 may be sliding towards
  defeat in the House of Representatives. Designed to undercut 1996
  amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act that have effectively banned
  RU486 and other abortifacient drugs from Australia, the Bill - having
  passed through the Senate last Thursday - is now the subject of an
  amendment that, if successful, will see the ban remain firmly in place.
  
  The amendments - one introduced by Queensland Liberal Andrew Laming and
  a another by NSW Liberal Jackie Kelly - are similar to those advanced in
  the Senate by Tasmanian Richard Colbeck and the Northern Territory’s
  Nigel Scullion. However, unlike the Colbeck/Scullion amendment, which
  attracted minimal support, some members of the Lower House - those in
  marginal seats or who relied on Family First preferences at the last
  election and have swallowed the ‘we will target you at the next
  election’ bluster of pro-life lobbyists - are now seriously considering
  throwing their support behind the Laming amendment.
  
  This is a disastrous outcome for those hoping for a quick resolution to
  the divisive debate about abortion that has accompanied the introduction
  of the Bill. It is also a blow to those hoping that the passage of the
  unamended Bill would mean that the Therapeutic Goods Administration
  (TGA) would finally get a chance to conduct an impartial and thorough
  evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the medication and - should
  they give the go ahead - approve the registration of the drug in
  Australia.
  
  Successful amendment of the Bill in the Lower House could mean
  Australians are in for ‘the abortion debate that time forgot.’ Indeed,
  this may be the intention of the amendment. A fax sent to all MPs urges
  them to vote for the amendment to ensure an ‘all-encompassing debate’ on
  the ‘moral and ethical’ - as well as the ‘safety’ - issues is had this
  time, and every time, the TGA approves such drugs.
  
  MPs who vote for the current amendments will condemn the rest of us to
  weeks, if not months, of further discussion on RU486 because the amended
  Bill must return to the Senate for consideration and a vote. If the
  Senate refuses to accept the amended Bill, the House of Representatives
  can either insist on their amendment or vote to pass the original. If
  they go the former route then the Bill will return to the Senate which
  can either vote to accept the amended one or return the original to the
  House of Represenatatives … and on and on it goes.
  
  Indeed, the Bill can become a football, passing back and forth between
  the two Houses until - unable to reach agreement - both agree to set it
  aside, meaning that the current untenable situation, where the Health
  Minister decides on drugs like RU486, prevails.
  
  There are both principled and practical problems with the Laming
  amendment. While it allows the TGA to evaluate the drug without prior
  approval of the Minister - the Parliament would have the power to
  override the TGA’s decision to register the drug. This replicates -
  indeed multiplies - the current problem of non-experts making critical
  decisions based on heaven-knows-what information about life-altering and
  life-saving medications.
  
  Liberal MP Danna Vale’s plea to her colleagues to vote against the
  current Bill because the drug’s availability could lead to Australia
  being dominated by Muslims - a claim not only replete with racist
  overtones but also based on the false assertion that making RU486
  available will increase the abortion rate - offers an insight into the
  sort of ‘logic’ that some MPs might apply to decisions about drugs like
  RU486 if given the chance by passing of the amendment.
  
  This principled problem leads to the practical problem already facing
  women and patients desperately seeking access to the drug: no
  pharmaceutical company is willing to go through the expensive and
  time-consuming process of seeking TGA registration for RU486, despite
  reams of high-quality evidence that it is both safe and effective. This
  is because of the uncertainty created by the current arrangements, which
  allow the Minister to veto the TGA’s ruling.
  
  The Laming amendment multiplies this uncertainty by allowing the TGA’s
  evidence-based decision to be overturned by Parliament and in so doing,
  virtually assures a continued absence of applications by drug companies
  to register and market the drug in Australia.
  
  Indeed, if the amendment passes, this could be the situation not just
  for abortifacient drugs but for all drugs a small, vociferous minority
  deems controversial. The pro-amendment fax states:
  
  RU486 is just the first of many highly controversial drugs which the TGA
  will confront over the next decade … The TGA Act 1989 should be amended
  to ensure that any controversial drug is not listed in Australia purely
  because it is safe and effective.
  
  Drug approval by popular opinion, it seems, is just around the corner.
  
  So close, yet so far. It is the face of Mary Lander - the Australian
  woman diagnosed around this time last year with an inoperable brain
  tumour who is still struggling to import RU486 to treat her condition -
  that swims before my eyes as I consider the possibility that having
  passed the Senate with such overwhelming support, this Bill may still be
  defeated.
  
  Mary’s face, and faces of the Australian women who - having made the
  difficult decision to terminate - are so determined to carry out this
  decision without undergoing surgery and without delay (medical abortion
  using RU486 can be done earlier than surgical abortion) that they hop on
  a plane to New Zealand or the UK to gain access to the drug.
  
  MPs considering the Laming amendment should not kid themselves that it
  represents a reasonable compromise position. In fact, the amendments
  undermine the fundamental intention of the Bill, which is to remove
  medical and scientific decisions from the hands of politicians, and
  place them in the hands of the experts at the TGA.
  
  Yes, RU486 procures early non-surgical abortion, but it also has the
  capacity to save the lives of countless Australians suffering from
  serious diseases. And insofar as MPs believe decisions relating to
  abortion needs to be regulated by politicians, they can rest assured
  that they are. Every State in Australia has criminal or medical
  regulations overseeing abortion and State MPs, like their Federal
  counterparts, come up for regular re-election, too. It has been argued
  more than once that, given the availability of legal abortion in
  Australia, the push by Federal parliamentarians to constrain the
  legitimate role of the TGA is illegitimately interfering with State laws
  and policies.
  
  Supporting the Laming amendment means affirming the dubious principle
  that politicians, rather than medical and scientific experts, are the
  right people to make critical decisions about one particular class of
  drugs. In practice, it means denying Australian women with an unplanned
  and unwanted pregnancy - and other Australian patients with
  life-threatening tumours and cancers - ready and affordable access to a
  pharmaceutical that is used safely and legally by millions of patients
  around the globe each year.
  
  Politicians have been afforded a conscience vote on this issue. They
  have a moral obligation to use it to ensure women, in consultation with
  their doctors, get one too.

  TEASE: *Pregnancies Don’t Need Support, Women Do*
  
  TEASE: ANYONE who followed the debate on RU486, and understood the
  complex politics surrounding it, knew it was coming: a quid pro quo for
  the Health Minister to soften the blow of losing his powers to deny
  Australian women access to RU486. It came last Thursday: a $51 million
  dollar package for two [pregnancy support measures]() a new counselling
  hotline and Medicare rebate. Then came the story of a push in Victoria
  to remove abortion from the Crimes Act.
  
  Counselling is like motherhood: something few want to oppose. But the
  truth is that some counselling isn’t what is seems. Far from improving
  the quality of women’s decisions, mental health or lives, biased
  counselling - funded by the Commonwealth to the tune of $350,982 - can
  cause lasting damage to women’s lives and mental health. Sadly, it
  appears that this is precisely the sort of “counselling” the Federal
  Government has in mind.
  
  There is one key feature that attaches to all legitimate counselling:
  the commitment to fostering a woman’s autonomy. At the heart of all
  ethical medical practice, you will find the key value of autonomy, the
  Greek root of which means “self-rule”. Why? Because only people free to
  direct and govern their lives according to their own values are
  recognised by others as having what Australian philosopher Robert Young
  describes as “the dignity that moral agency bestows”.
  
  There are three reasons to doubt that the Government’s proposed measures
  will foster women’s autonomy and protect their dignity. The first is
  that, as their title makes clear, they are designed to support
  pregnancies, not women. If pregnancy maintenance, not quality
  decision-making, is the name of the game, it’s hard to see how factually
  accurate and non-directive support and advice is on the cards.
  
  Ditto the undisguised aim of both measures: to reduce the abortion rate.
  The Government says they are necessary to address Australia’s high
  abortion rate. At the news conference launching the plan, the Prime
  Minister said: “We don’t like the number of abortions. We think it’s too
  high.” How can a service designed to stop women having abortions (how
  else to reduce the abortion rate?) provide impartial, non-directive
  advice? How can such a service meet the ethical requirement of promoting
  women’s autonomy? Won’t the successful tenderer be evaluated on how well
  it achieves the Government’s aims of reducing the abortion rate? If so,
  how can we expect this service to do anything other than discourage
  women from choosing abortion?
  
  This worry is exacerbated by the Government’s insistence that religious
  organisations will be eligible to tender for the telephone helpline
  contract. While abortion service-providers and counsellors working in
  abortion clinics have been seen as having a “conflict of interest” that
  renders them incapable of providing impartial, non-directive support and
  referral for all three options available to pregnant women - abortion,
  adoption and continuing - religious providers are not. This beggars
  belief, particularly given the widespread acceptance of medical
  conscientious objection not just to providing abortion services, but
  referring women to someone who will.
  
  Moral conflicts of interest are as real as financial ones, and there is
  little doubt that a tender process truly committed to identifying a
  service committed to fostering women’s autonomy would rule out
  applicants with religious or philosophical objections to abortion.
  
  The truth is that if the Government wants to reduce the abortion rate,
  the most ethical and effective approach is to tackle unplanned
  pregnancies. No woman wants to be pregnant when she feels unable -
  because she is unemployed, homeless, single, living in a violent home or
  is just a teenager herself - to be a good and responsible parent to the
  child. This makes government support for education and contraception
  access programs not only the most effective way to lower the abortion
  rate, but - because it supports women to achieve shared aims - the only
  ethical one.
  
  Pregnancies don’t need support, women do. They also need respect. The
  aim of any legitimate counselling service must be to foster women’s
  autonomy, not to achieve government aims such as reducing the number of
  abortions or increasing the birthrate. Using women as a means to
  government or church ends is not just unethical, it may lead to women
  being deceived or induced - perhaps even coerced through false
  information or an absence of timely advice - into having an unwanted
  child: not a recipe for happy families.
  
  If a financial conflict of interest is seen to render those involved
  with abortions ineligible to provide impartial advice, support and
  referral for all three options with an unplanned pregnancy, a moral
  conflict of interest surely rules religious and pro-life providers out,
  too.
  
  At a minimum, the potential for abuse of trust must be acknowledged. It
  is likely that women will assume that neutrally named services,
  particularly when promoted with the Australian coat of arms, will
  support them to make a choice consistent with their situation and
  values. If the agency running the helpline has a religious or
  philosophical objection to abortion, women need to be informed of this
  on all advertising materials.
  
  They must also be told it when they ring. And offered an alternative
  number for a legitimate service. One that has no other agenda than
  assisting her to make the choice that is right for her, and no religious
  beliefs to limit the support they provide for her to carry it out.

  Crochet hooks, castor oil, slippery elm bark, syringes full of Lifeuboy
  soap and Dettol. Sepsis, gas gangrene of the uterus, hysterectomies on
  12 year olds, deserted pregnant wives taking their children and jumping
  off the St Kilda pier and women waiting, scared and alone, on a dark
  windswept corner of Bourke Street for the stranger’s car that would take
  them, huddled beneath a blanket on the floor of the backseat, to the
  backyard abortionist. And if they haemorrhaged on the kitchen table, the
  best they could hope for was to be dumped on the corner near the Royal
  Women’s in the hope that someone would find them in time. Many died.
  
  This was the reproductive terrain that Victorian women were forced to
  negotiate 35 years ago when their “little friend” failed to arrive and,
  because they were sick, poor, young, bashed or simply unable to shoulder
  the burdens of motherhood at that time, decided to seek an abortion. For
  women of means, the illegal procedure would be provided by a qualified
  gynaecologist in the comfort of a private hospital. Poor women took
  their chances with well-meaning neighbourhood “Vera Drakes” or similarly
  unqualified “backyarders.”
  
  In 1967 Bertram Wainer, a Scottish-born St Kilda GP with a passionate
  commitment to social justice and Jo Wainer, incipient feminist and
  inaugural secretary of the Abortion Law Reform Association, sought
  reform. In the process, they uncovered a web of corruption involving
  doctors, backyard abortionists, high-ranking policemen and suspect
  politicians. They ran three separate test cases to test the reach of the
  newly-minted Menhennitt ruling that allowed abortion, prohibited in the
  Victorian Crimes Act, in a limited range of circumstances.
  
  Bert Wainer’s story is told in Abortion, Corruption & Cops, a film by
  writer/director John Moore, whose previous credits include the
  award-winning documentary Guns & Roses and Thomas of Arnhem Land. Moving
  seamlessly between archival footage and dramatic recreations with Kurt
  Geyer as Bert Wainer and Genevieve Picot as
  backyard-abortionist-turned-good Peggy Berman, Moore summons up the
  stifling prudery and religious moralism of the era. He interviews
  grandmotherly-looking women whose eyes grow bright with fright as they
  remember having to spread their legs on a stranger’s kitchen table while
  instruments boiled away on the stove, or who still find it hard to laugh
  when they recall how an unwanted pregnancy gave a girl first-hand
  knowledge of the “lies, exploitation and deviousness” that accompany all
  illegal practices.
  
  But Bert Wainer’s story should resonate for more than just history
  buffs. The Federal Government’s ill-disguised antagonism towards women’s
  reproductive rights gives relevance to Wainer’s assertion that “abortion
  will continue and have little, if anything, to do with the Church, the
  law or the doctors, but have a very great deal to do with people and
  particularly with women”. His moral indignation about police
  confiscation of medical files, which he saw as an attack patient privacy
  and dignity, seems a salutary reminder of the importance of these values
  in light of recent government proposals to introduce a specific Medicare
  item number for abortion counselling that could enable tracking of
  doctors and women. “Every child a wanted child”, the poster Wainer
  proudly hangs in his newly opened fertility clinic in East Melbourne,
  remains a pertinent reply to those who hand-wring about the number of
  abortions.
  
  “Stand for something or fall for anything”, goes the old saying. Until
  his death in 1987, Wainer stood for many things. It was his deep respect
  for the police and their role in enforcing the rule of law that saw him
  devastated by his discovery of corruption in the force, and his decision
  to turn whistle-blower. As a medical student and intern, he’d had little
  interest in abortion and, like other reputable doctors at the time, had
  simply referred women to illegal provides when they came to him for
  help. But when a woman came into his surgery dying from a botched
  abortion but too terrified to go to hospital for fear of arrest, he
  refused to look the other way. He got indignant, angry and - in the best
  feminist tradition - active. But while sympathetic to women, Wainer was
  no feminist. The man Moore describes in Abortion Corruption & Cops is a
  social justice campaigner. A man whose own deprived upbringing had
  alerted him to the ways in which the rich could circumvent harsh and
  unjust laws, while the poor were forced to live with - or die from -
  their consequences.
  
  In her new book about women’s stories of illegal abortion, timed for
  release to coincide with the screening of Abortion, Corruption & Cops,
  Jo Wainer says that having “tweaked the tail” of the State, Bert
  suffered its retributive power. In return for having forced a public
  inquiry into police corruption and opened the state’s first legal
  abortion clinic. Bert Wainer was bankrupted by the Australian Tax
  Office, evicted from his medical surgery by a landlady under pressure
  from a Catholic bishop, and censured by the AMA.

  Pregnancy counsellors must declare their stance on abortion.
  
  Australian women have just inched one step closer to gaining access to
  RU486. Last week, Cairns-based obstetrician Dr Caroline De Costa
  received word that her application to become an authorised prescriber of
  the medication had been approved by the national drug regulator, the
  Therapeutic Goods Administration.
  
  Despite the fanfare surrounding February’s passage of the cross-party
  bill that removed the Heath Minister’s veto over the TGA’s decision to
  register the drug, pregnant women are still awaiting access to the
  medication - as a morning-after pill, to assist in labour or to
  terminate a very early pregnancy without surgery - because no company
  has submitted an application.
  
  While De Costa’s approval as an authorised prescriber comes with
  restrictions that preclude her from supplying other medical
  practitioners with the drug, or accepting patients living outside far
  north Queensland, it both signals and further strengthens the case for
  TGA registration of the drug when an application is finally submitted.
  This is because to say “yes” to De Costa, the TGA has to evaluate the
  drug’s safety and efficacy against the seriousness of the condition, and
  the acceptability of existing therapies to treat it. Signing off on her
  application signals the regulator’s acceptance of the veracity and
  quality of the research data demonstrating the drug’s safety and
  efficacy that De Costa was required to submit to support her
  application. This bodes well for requests before the TGA from other
  medicos wanting to become authorised prescribers and an application by a
  pharmaceutical company - when one finally is made - to make the drug
  more broadly available.
  
  Pro-choice supporters would also have been heartened by the recent
  elevation of the staunchly pro-choice Louise Asher to the position of
  deputy leader of the Liberal Party in Victoria to join pro-choice leader
  Robert Doyle. With the Victorian Labor Party having recently affirmed
  its commitment to amend the Victorian Crimes Act to make abortion legal
  when a woman gives her informed consent, the stage is set for change
  after the election in November.
  
  Elsewhere, however, pro-life forces are making their influence felt. As
  in Victoria, the Crimes Act in NSW prohibits abortion. Earlier this
  month, the Crown prosecutor in the case of NSW doctor Dr Suman Sood
  moved to amend the indictment to include a second charge of
  administering a drug with “intent to procure a miscarriage”. If Sood is
  convicted, women’s access to safe, legal terminations could be reduced
  in NSW through the narrowing of the reach of the 1971 and 1995 common
  law judgements that enable lawful abortion.
  
  But perhaps nowhere have pro-life forces been more successful than in
  their co-option of the word “counselling” to pursue their goal of
  reducing women’s access to abortion.
  
  In addition to being on the Federal Government payroll to the tune of
  $295,000 in 2005 and 2006, the pro-life Australian Federation of
  Pregnancy Support Services (formerly the Australian Federation of
  Pro-Life Pregnancy Support Services) is manoeuvring to win the tender to
  provide a national telephone helpline to support women to keep
  pregnancies. The helpline, one of two recently announced “pregnancy
  support measures”, is seen as compensation for Health Minister Tony
  Abbott’s loss of control over RU486.
  
  Will AFPSS win the helpline tender? They’re certainly in contention,
  because while the Government has ruled out abortion providers from
  tendering for the contract to ensure the provision of a “non-directive”
  service, organisations with a religious or philosophical opposition to
  abortion have been deemed to have the professionalism and
  even-handedness necessary to apply.
  
  While some Australians might question the appropriateness of the Federal
  Government coat of arms being attached to a telephone hotline staffed by
  a service with a principled opposition to advising or referring for
  abortion, few would dispute the right of women to be told up-front and
  unequivocally if a service will provide accurate information about, and
  refer for, abortion. Yet there is no consumer protection regulation in
  any state that prohibits pregnancy clinics from falsely advertising
  their services. Because the services don’t levy a fee, the Australian
  Competition and Consumer Commission cannot charge them with engaging in
  misleading or deceptive advertising.
  
  Last year, Pregnancy Counselling Australia, which has links to
  international pro-life pregnancy centres, sent posters to GPs across the
  country. Depicting the photo of a young attractive woman chewing her
  nails the text read: “Pregnant? Upset?” “Free, confidential,
  compassionate, counselling” on a 24-hour basis was promised to women who
  rang the number provided. While the vast majority of GPs are pro-choice,
  many were fooled by the poster and the accompanying covering letter that
  implied that Pregnancy Counselling Australia offered a service that
  would support and refer women for all three options with an unplanned
  pregnancy: adoption, continuing and abortion. As Pregnancy Counselling
  Australia requested, many put the poster in their consulting suites and
  waiting rooms.
  
  The Democrats have developed a private member’s bill to ensure truth in
  advertising when it comes to pregnancy support services. To become law,
  this bill - or one like it - will need cross-party support. The question
  is: after the battle over RU486, do pro-choice activists and politicians
  have the energy to battle as hard as will be required to achieve basic
  consumer protection for pregnant women?

  Should children be told they were conceived by sperm or egg donation?
  
  "Go home, have sex and forget about it. That’s what doctors used to tell
  infertile couples in the early days of donor insemination. Donors, too,
  were assumed to want, and were provided with, total anonymity as a
  condition for their donation. In some instances, no records of the event
  - little less non-identifying information about the donor - were kept.
  
  Many Australians would be matter of fact about donor insemination as a
  means of creating a family, but stigma still attaches to the procedure.
  Persistent confusion between male fertility and potency, and the
  insistence of critics that it constitutes infidelity and encourages an
  addiction to masturbation is to blame. It also goes some way towards
  explaining why the vast majority of the approximately 600 Australian
  children born every year from donor sperm, or more rarely eggs or
  embryos, are ignorant of their birth origins. Studies suggest that only
  about 10% of such children know they are donor-conceived, and that only
  20 to 50% of parents plan to let the cat out of the bag at some point in
  the future.
  
  The cost of such secrecy is unclear. A handful of mental health
  professionals contend that telling traumatises children by disturbing
  their identity and their relationship with their social father, and that
  the rights of parents to decide if and when to tell ought to be
  respected. Most health professionals, however, decry family secrets as
  destructive and concur with a vocal group of donor-conceived children
  that knowledge of one’s genetic origins and related health information
  is a human right. They also point to the damage that can be caused by
  accidental disclosure, which can often be ill timed (adolescence appears
  to be a bad time to find out) and poorly executed. Melbourne University
  researcher Maggie Kirkman tells of donor-conceived adults who have had
  their mothers shout “anyway, he’s not really your father” during an
  argument, or who recall twigging in biology class that their brown eyes
  couldn’t have come from the mating of their two blue-eyed parents.
  Relatives and family friends are also a significant disclosure risk
  because while few parents tell their offspring, 60% have confided in
  another person: a sympathetic friend or maybe their mother. Such
  parental confidants, as Kirman sagely notes, “can be expected to pass on
  the information, which may eventually reach the ear of the
  [donor-conceived] child or adult.”
  
  The proliferation of genetic tests available to Australians as part of
  routine healthcare, and changes to legal regimes in many jurisdictions
  including the UK, Sweden, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Victoria,
  also increase the risk that donor-conceived children will stumble across
  the truth. In July, the first crop of donor-conceived children covered
  by 1988 Victorian legislation that controversially entitles anonymous
  donors to set in train processes that will lead their biological child
  to become aware that they were conceived by donor gametes, turn 18.
  
  While we may not agree with all the reasons parents have for delaying or
  deciding against disclosure, some may engender our sympathy. Parents
  fear their child will be distressed to discover a lack of genetic link
  with one or both of them, particularly when, as is the case for some
  children, information about the donor is scant. The non-biological
  parent - usually the father - may worry his child will love him less
  when she learns there is no biological link, or that others will see the
  family as less than “normal”. And some parents are simply so
  uncomfortable talking about sex, that the prospect of having to explain
  to their little ones the more complex reproductive arrangements that
  prevailed in their situation daunt them into silence.
  
  In most Western countries, including Australia, the law tends to allow
  parents to make their own decisions - according to their own values -
  about what is in the best interests of their offspring. The only
  exception is when the courts are convinced the parent’s decision is
  putting their child’s health and safety at risk. By allowing donors to
  set in train processes that will reveal to a child that he or she is
  donor-conceived, the State government has asserted what it believes is
  in a child’s best interests, and forced the hand of parents of
  donor-conceived children in the direction of telling. Whether parental
  denial of knowledge about genetic origins really does threaten a child’s
  health and safety to a degree that such intervention is justified, or
  whether it wrongly establishes donor-conceived families as second-class
  ones, is a matter for debate.
  
  The reality for parents of donor-conceived children, however, is that
  changing social, medical realities make secret keeping an increasingly
  risky proposition. Victorian parents must be mindful that July is around
  the corner. If their child is among the first crop of donor-conceived
  kids affected by Victoria’s prevailing legal regime, the time to tell is
  now.
  
  The Infertility Treatment Authority (ITA) administers the regulation of
  infertility treatment in Victoria. The ITA offers information and
  support to parents deciding if, when and how to tell children the full
  story of their conception. More information about telling can be found
  at [www.ita.org.au](http://www.ita.org.au/).

  Former footballer, broadcaster and TV fisherman Rex Hunt’s entanglement
  in a scandal of his own making may not engage everyone’s sympathy and
  interest. Tabloid-fodder, we might sniff, before returning to the more
  serious business of sipping lattes and cracking open expensive bottles
  of chardonnay.
  
  But Hunt’s story (extra-marital sex with three women, hush-money paid,
  embarrassed wife standing by her man, yada-yada-yada) has engendered the
  same debate that often accompanies media decisions to headline the
  misadventures of the rich and famous. A debate about whether such
  stories are in the public interest, or simply of interest to the public.
  
  It would be a mistake to think that Hunt’s marital infidelity is what’s
  drawn the attention of the press. Recent Australian history suggests
  that it is not infidelity per se, but hypocrisy that often goads the
  press into running with a story. Infidelity is often the incident that
  exposes such double standards, but it’s not the only one. Remember the
  huff-and-puff photos of Shane Warne that gave lie to his claim that he’d
  quit smoking?
  
  The Kernot affair also shows the critical role hypocrisy plays in
  journalists’ decisions to take a story public. Cheryl Kernot’s affair
  with former Labor foreign minister Gareth Evans was well-known to the
  Canberra press gallery. Reporter Laurie Oakes only spilled the beans -
  and set the media frenzy in train - in the wake of Kernot’s decision to
  exclude this information from her memoir. Free in apportioning fault to
  everyone else for her political downfall, Oakes objected to what he saw
  as the hypocritical omission of information that might have pointed at
  least one of the fingers of blame in her direction.
  
  It is said that every culture has prohibitions against hypocrisy. In all
  likelihood, this is because hypocrisy can indicate significant
  character-flaws like hubris, dishonesty and an inability to take
  personal responsibility. While we probably wouldn’t mind being notified
  about the presence of such qualities in all those we deal with (I’d opt
  for a Logan’s Run-esque blinking palm light myself), we feel entitled -
  rightly I think - to get the skinny on such matters when it comes to
  public figures.
  
  This is because the stature of public figures like Hunt give them
  privileges the rest of us don’t enjoy. Small perks like the wielding of
  power to shape the world in which we live, either through the
  implementation of policy, or the use of media platforms to influence
  health, fashion or lifestyle trends. When AFL footballers are condemned
  for their shabby treatment of women, it’s not just because such
  behaviour - no matter who does it - merits our disapproval, but also
  because they aren’t anyone. They are the blokes our kids, particularly
  boys aged 6 to 20, admire and seek to emulate. They speak and we listen.
  I mean, d’oh! That’s why our so many Fortune 500 companies are after
  these fellas to promote their products.
  
  This means two things. Firstly, that the public may be justified in
  expecting a higher standard of behaviour from public than they do from
  Joe and Judy Blow. Some people might argue this is unfair. They did when
  Wayne Carey was being pilloried for simultaneously doing the dirty on
  his best friend and his own partner Sally by sleeping with Anthony
  Stevens’ wife, Kelli. “He’s an athlete,” they cried. “Just because a
  bloke can kick a football doesn’t mean he was first in line when they
  handed out basic human decency.”
  
  Perhaps less controversial is the contention that public figures with
  the stature to command column inches and television time - be they
  politicians, radio shock-jocks, or entertainers - need to put up or shut
  up when it comes to how the rest of us live. If powerful people use
  their capacity to command an audience to outline their moral view about
  how we should all run our marriages, manage our health or rationalise
  our citizenships, it seems only fair to expect them to practice what
  they preach, or to suffer the pain of being outed as a hypocrite. It was
  former Liberal politician Ross Cameron’s choice to gallivant around his
  electorate preaching family values, and plastering photos of his four
  children and smiling wife across his promotional materials. When he also
  chose not to keep his pants buttoned, the media was perfectly entitled -
  if not obliged - to let the public know.
  
  With benefits come costs; with license comes responsibility. Should this
  responsibility not be met, the public has a right to know. The
  judgements we make from there is up to us. We may shrug, and run the “to
  err is human” script in our head. We may decide our hero still deserves
  our worship or the politician our vote, or then again we might not.
  
  Yes, public figures live in a fishbowl, but for most of them - and
  certainly for Rex Hunt - that’s their choice. Other jobs with lower
  profiles and salaries are available; one’s where the mismatch between
  what one says and does are more likely to be overlooked.
  
  Then too, there’s always the option of just keeping one’s one mouth
  shut.

  Book Review - Lost: Illegal abortion stories. Edited by Jo Wainer,
  foreward by Helen Garner. Carlton, Melbourne University Press, 2006. 214
  pages. ISBN: 0~~522~~85231–9
  
  For some, but perhaps not enough of us, time and people divide into two
  categories: the time before abortion laws were liberalised, and the time
  after; those who remember what it was like prior to decriminalisation,
  and those who don’t.
  
  Lost is about the time before, written for those who came after, or who
  wish to pay tribute to the women they knew who lived through those
  terrible before-times by bearing witness to their stories. It is edited
  and introduced by Dr Jo Wainer whose own life, according to a somewhat
  different chronology, also divides into before and after. Her first
  20-odd years before she became the inaugural treasurer of the Abortion
  Law Reform Association in 1967, and all that’s come after in which, as
  an activist, service-provider and now academic, she has dedicated to the
  “task of understanding the political, legal, religious, social and
  medical issues…buried in that one word - abortion.”
  
  Wainer and writer Helen Garner, who authors a short foreword to the
  collection, vividly describe the stifling, puritan backdrop of 1950s
  Melbourne against which the dramas of individual women play out. But it
  is Lost’s collection of 21 first-hand accounts by aborting women - some
  young, some old, nearly all poor - that captivate both attention and
  heart. Stories, as Garner notes, that even without descriptions of the
  women’s appearance or the way her voice sounds and body moves as she
  talks, still contain “matter enough for a novel”.
  
  Amy waited until marriage to have sex, only to discover she’d prefer to
  bake a “lovely sponge cake” than have intercourse with her violent
  alcoholic husband. She had several children in quick succession before -
  unable to find effective contraception or to resist her husband’s
  attention - she endured several anaesthetic-free curettes in a
  stranger’s lounge room.
  
  21-year old Belinda was denied the Pill by a doctor with a framed
  picture of Mother Mary on his desk, and was lectured for half an hour on
  the mortal sin of single women using contraception. When she became
  pregnant, she wanted to continue, but her boyfriend refused to support
  her. To get a safe abortion at 20 weeks she had to get a psychiatrist to
  write a letter - the existence of which on her medical files spooked her
  for years afterwards - saying she’d be an unfit mother.
  
  Sixteen year old Beverly’s instructions from the backyarder who
  consented to terminate her were as follows: “Come here Thursday morning
  with $600, bring a packet of pads, a packet of Panadol and don’t expect
  to go home until Friday night”. When she hesitated before spreading her
  legs on the man’s kitchen table, he admonishes: “Don’t worry about your
  pride and dignity now, girl. You lost that the day you got yourself into
  this mess”.
  
  And on it goes. Bashed women. Scared women. Women so ignorant of the
  rudiments of sex they don’t even realise they’re pregnant until in
  labour and, even then, have little idea from what orfice the baby will
  emerge. Women who accepted the contempt and even sexual violence of
  abortion providers or the doctors they relied on for referrals to safer
  practitioners as apt punishment for the sexual “sins” that led to the
  abortion, or the abortion itself. And women who, inexplicably given the
  tone and tenor of the times, reject all efforts to make them feel like
  dirt: “Mind your own business and don’t bother sending me a bill!”
  Belinda told the Mother Mary doctor before slamming the door behind her.
  Says Beverly indignantly of her first interview with the backyard
  provider: “He didn’t even ask my name”.
  
  But while it is each story’s particularity that rivets, it was the
  common elements of women’s stories - the secrecy, the exploitation, the
  violence, the suffering, the death - that gave them political charge. Jo
  and Bert Wainer knew this, and while Bert solicited the stories in Lost
  in 1985 in a “lest we forget” spirit, he had used newspaper ads to urge
  women to speak their truths before, and had used the information he
  elicited to raise awareness of the costs to women and to society -
  through the flowering of police corruption - of prohibition. Women’s
  stories were at the heart of the Wainers’ agitation for a Royal
  Commission into police corruption, and their pursuit of test cases that
  established the reach of the common law ruling on which Victorian women
  still rely for safe, legal services.
  
  Before turning the first page of Lost, I hesitated. However worthy the
  aim, I knew enough about the pre-legalisation era to know I was standing
  on the threshold of a whole world of pain. But from Garner’s opening
  words - “It’s an awe-inspiring force, the iron determination of a woman
  who refuses to bear a child that she knows she cannot mother” - I was
  hooked. Unable to put the book down, I read straight through to the end.
  
  How could I have forgotten the compelling privilege of being invited
  into the most painful and intimate corners of other people’s lives? In
  particular, I felt touched by the way in which women’s fears, health and
  lives were unquestionably at the centre of the moral Rubicon of
  pre~~1980s abortion politics. Then, like now, the fetus was never far
  from women’s minds: its potential to be their helpless, demanding and
  desperately-loved baby the impetus for the abortion in the first place.
  But unlike today, where women must battle to be seen and heard in the
  public debate against chaste, silhouetted images of fetuses set off in
  surrounds reminiscent of space capsules, the womb was opaque. Women
  decided what doctors, husbands and others would know of the developing
  life inside, and it was their experience of gestation and impeding
  motherhood~~ wonder-filled or terrifying, desired or unwanted - that
  mediated its relationship with others.
  
  Indeed, at the heart of the contemporary abortion debate is one about
  the moral frame. Are women at the centre of the story; those who should
  rightly evoke our compassion and hold the trumping rights, or is it
  fetuses? Are women autonomous choosers of abortion or duped and bereaved
  victims of it?
  
  I feel confident about what the Wainers, and the women of Lost, would
  say.

  The recent “Camilla” incident streamed from the Big Brother house
  several weeks ago renewed controversy about the show’s suitability for
  free-to-air TV.
  
  Of course for some, the issue was decided long ago. Victorian Family
  Council Secretary Bill Muelenberg, Family First Senator Senator Steven
  Fielding and Queensland Nationals MP Paul Neville have long condemned
  the show as sleazy and dangerously sexually licentious. In the wake of
  the weekend’s “incident”, this conga line was joined by the leaders of
  both major parties. The Opposition Leader lamented the show’s treatment
  of young women, while the Prime Minister asked Channel Ten to take the
  “stupid program” off air.
  
  Are calls for media self-censorship evidence of feminist inroads into
  the sensibilities of the nation’s leaders, the relentless crusade of
  Christian moralists to control what the rest of us see, hear and read,
  or just plain commonsense? Was the two minutes that shook the world in
  the collective bedroom of the Big Brother household evidence of the
  depravity of today’s male youth, or just how far - in the sexual
  politics stakes - they’ve come?
  
  Deciding requires us to disentangle the varied business and moral
  mandates in play. From a commercial point of view, it’s arguable that
  Channel 10 had little choice but to follow the advice of media studies
  academic Catherine Lumby and evict the men from the house for being on
  the wrong side of what Lumby described as the line dividing “sexual
  behaviour and sexual assault”. The recent axing of Big Brother Adults
  after pressure from Coalition MPs proved the not inconsiderable sway of
  the Christian right in this country, and appeasing them by turfing the
  men out and inviting the Queensland police to investigate made good
  business sense.
  
  The network’s response, however, says little about whether the behaviour
  of the two men merited condemnation on moral grounds. Lumby said the men
  were guilty of sexual assault, while Communications Minister Helen
  Coonan charged them with objectifying women. But in all the frenetic
  tut-tutting that surrounded the case, few have considered whether the
  young men’s response to Camilla’s objection to their unquestionably
  inappropriate behaviour shows a solid understanding of the key feminist
  principle that whatever she wears and wherever she goes, when a woman
  says “no”, she means “no”.
  
  The footage confirms Big Brother’s deliberate construction of sexually
  charged situations that the young people of the house are expected to
  smoothly and consistently negotiate before a national audience. In the
  moments leading up the incident, Camilla - wearing underwear and a
  cleavage-revealing skivvy - slides into John and Ash’s bed. A moment
  later, John’s arm is pressing her to the bed, while Ash appears to whip
  out his genitals and rub them in her face. This part of the story we
  know.
  
  What has received less attention is what comes next. Camilla vocally
  objects to what is happening to her and the lads withdraw, immediately
  and fully.
  
  There is no question that John and Ash’s forceful act of restraint and
  sexual domination of
  
  Camilla should not - without her express and prior permission - have
  taken place. For this, they owed her a sincere and profound apology.
  However, it seems an act of deliberate blindness to ignore the alacrity
  with which the men responded to her insistence that they back off.
  Surveys continue to show a disturbing number of men continue to believe
  women really mean “yes” when they say “no”. John and Ash, however, don’t
  appear to be among them.
  
  Maintaining consent as the key arbiter of what constitutes assault or
  otherwise deviant behaviour is critical to preserving the liberation of
  female desire and sexuality for which second-generation feminists
  strove. Women can fancy a threesome, dig S& M or fantasise about
  gerbils. As long as they are competent, and freely give their consent,
  neither the label “victim” or “slut” should apply.
  
  The opposing point of view - endorsed by an uneasy colation of radical
  anti-porn feminist and Christian crusaders - is that some (mostly male)
  sexual behaviour is intrinsically aggressive or otherwise sinful, and
  needs to be curtailed, for the sake of women and/or civilisation as a
  whole.
  
  We can laugh at the arrogance and narrow-mindedness of such views, but
  the barbarians are at the gate. Maintaining individual control over what
  we watch, the privacy of our bedroom and how we define and express our
  desires and capacities as men and women requires that we consistently
  affirm, in art as well as in life, the important of consent in defining
  what we do - and is done to us — as right or wrong.

  Co-authored with Dr Elizabeth Finkel
  
  TEASE: Late last year, the Lockhart Legislative Review Committee - the
  Federal Government’s own handpicked experts - handed down its
  recommendations on the fate of stem cell research in this country. Among
  other things, the Committee recommended lifting Australia’s ban on
  so-called “therapeutic cloning”. Having first shelved the report on the
  basis of a cabinet vote, a backbench revolt saw the Prime Minister agree
  to a broader discussion at the first party room meeting after winter
  break. That meeting - otherwise known as Stem Cell D-Day - is today.
  
  The flashpoint of the debate will be therapeutic cloning. This type of
  cloning is not about copying people, but copying their cells.
  
  What is the potential of this technique? Imagine Mary, a child with
  leukaemia, needs a bone marrow graft to replace her diseased cells. One
  of her skin cells would be cloned to generate a primitive embryo. The
  cloning technique involves inserting the skin cell’s nucleus - which
  runs the genetic program for skin - into a donated human egg that’s own
  nucleus has been removed. Being inside the egg resets the program of the
  skin’s nucleus to begin dividing. Several days later embryonic stem
  cells will be extracted; a process that will halt all further
  development. The matched graft would significantly raise Mary’s odds of
  survival.
  
  Mary’s therapy has actually already been achieved in mice. In 2002, a US
  researcher used the technique to give mice a perfectly matched bone
  marrow transplant. “Oh to be a mouse”, said the late Christopher Reeve.
  George Daley now has a license to use therapeutic cloning to make
  matched human bone marrow cells.
  
  Alternatively if Mary suffered from motor neuron disease or juvenile
  diabetes, such cells would provide faithful models of the disease to
  test new drugs. The promise of therapeutic cloning has already
  galvanized research in the UK and the US where highly esteemed
  scientists are working for better treatment of bone marrow disease,
  motor neuron disease, diabetes and the crippling disease amyotropic
  lateral sclerosis. Other countries also have the legislative freedom to
  pursue this research: Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Belgium, Spain,
  Finland, Israel, Singapore and China.
  
  Many in Howard’s party are vehemently opposed to the technique. They
  believe it is morally repugnant to create and destroy an embryo. They
  also vehemently contest the true therapeutic potential of the technique.
  Others in the party believe the moral imperative to advance research
  that could alleviate human suffering trumps concerns about the status of
  an embryo transiently created from a skin cell.
  
  The Lockhart Review sought to cut through this debate and indicate a way
  forward. Lockhart argued that the views of different communities on the
  moral acceptability of therapeutic cloning are not reconcilable, and,
  because research in this area is in its early stages, there is no point
  in second-guessing its long-term prospects. Given this, the Review
  advised that the debate must shift to the proper role of governments in
  managing such radical moral disagreement.
  
  It is this question, not irreconcilable ones about the moral status of
  the embryo or the ultimate medical benefits of the science, that should
  be at the centre of today’s party room debate about the fate of
  embryonic stem cell research in Australia.
  
  The Lockhart Review advocated the Government adopt a compromise
  approach. Rather than allow the moral values of one section of the
  community to ride roughshod over those held by the rest, it urged the
  government to capitalise on areas of community consensus by, for
  instance, continuing its ban on reproductive cloning. Where moral views
  were hopelessly divided, it supported a licensing system where both
  institutional ethics committees and a government appointed committee of
  experts examine each research proposal individually.
  
  This is the type of regulatory framework that has been in place since
  2002 to control research using surplus embryos from fertility clinics.
  Thus far nine licences, all of limited duration, have been issued, five
  for improving fertility treatment, four for stem cell research. The
  licensing requirements are stringent, with researchers needing to
  justify the purpose of the research and the number of embryos required.
  
  In areas of radical moral disagreement, the proper role of government is
  to pursue meaningful compromise. The existing ban on therapeutic cloning
  serves as a legal brick wall. The Lockhart committee recommended
  replacing the wall with a hurdle, high enough to block proposals of
  questionable merit, but low enough to allow those of great worth to get
  over.
  
  In a pluralist democracy like Australia, the Federal Government must
  either accept the Lockhart recommendations, or allow our elected
  representatives to cast a conscience vote on the issue.

  It’s enough to make you feel queasy. A recent Harris poll found that
  half the American public - up from 36% last year ~~believe Iraq had
  weapons of mass destruction at the time of the US invasion. This despite
  the fact that final report of the Iraq Survey Group~~ experts handpicked
  by the CIA and Pentagon - concluded that Iraq had no deployable
  chemical, biological or nuclear weapons in 2003, and had not produced
  any since 1991.
  
  Who’s to blame for the escalating factual indifference of much of the
  American public? Some commentators - including the author of the Iraq
  Survey Group’s report - have been quick to point the finger at the lack
  of editorial control exercised over much of the content of the World
  Wide Web. “It would be a shame,” said Charles Duelfer, “if one effect of
  the power of the internet was to undermine any commonly agreed set of
  facts”.
  
  Negative press about the power and reach of the internet is rare.
  Instead, we hear much about the democratisation of knowledge enabled by
  the capacity of any Tom, Dick and Dana to report news or offer their
  analysis of it via personal websites, blogs, forums or contributions to
  the proliferation of boutique news and opinion outlets like Crikey and
  On Line Opinion.
  
  In some very important ways, net enthusiasts are right. The processes by
  which powerful editors in mainstream news organizations determine what
  will be spoken about - and by who - lacks transparency and
  accountability, while the demand for high-powered credentials curtails
  the capacity of the average punter to be heard. By sheer weight of
  numbers, the proliferation of media outlets, personal websites, blogs
  and forums on the Web offer punters the chance to move beyond passive
  consumption of the news towards an active role in shaping it.
  
  But herein lies the rub. Peruse personal websites, blogs and the comment
  sections offered by mainstream and boutique news sites, and amid the
  sometimes insightful and occasionally amusing commentary are a
  significant number of contributions in contention for the
  totally-missed-the-point, played-the-person-not-the-ball, mono-rail-mind
  or axe-to-grind awards. On one Australian opinion site, a band of “forum
  participants” with masculine, often gladiatorial-sounding names, roam
  from one female-authored article to the next displaying both significant
  anger management and comprehension issues.
  
  Further, despite names suggestive of a certain seriousness of purpose
  many personal websites and blogs are little more than cyber-cliques
  where the initiated preach to the paranoid in a closed and unfalsifiable
  system of proof. “You’re entitled to your own opinion, not your own
  facts,” US Senator Patrick Moynihan once noted. But if their recent
  “analysis” of a CNN presenter’s concern about the results of the Harris
  poll is anything to go by, the folks at Newsbusters.org (“Exposing and
  Combating Liberal Media Bias”) appear not to understand the distinction
  - crucial for any serious newsman or woman - between fact and value:
  “Dontcha love it when liberal media members are confounded by poll
  results that don’t fit their view of the world? It drives them so batty
  that they suddenly start espousing all manner of absurd rationalizations
  they believe explain why so many Americans disagree with them.”
  
  I am not saying that the sort of hierarchical editorial processes
  traditionally exercised in newsrooms across the globe are the only one
  that can achieve accurate, coherent, pointed and
  argumentatively-rigorous content. A recent peer-reviewed study in Nature
  found that Wikipedia science entries were nearly as accurate as those
  found in Encyclopaedia Britannica (4 errors per article versus 3). This
  suggests that a group of enthusiasts and bone fide experts can debate as
  equals and eventually arrive at an agreed set of facts. While “Wiki”
  creation clearly involves more time and stress for content-creators than
  traditional editorial processes (collaboration always does), it offers
  readers distinct advantages. Perhaps most valuable is their exposure to
  the contested nature of some historical and scientific debates.
  Wikipedia entries on Freud and Holocaust Denial, for instance, alert
  readers to the controversial nature of the subject, and allow them to
  view the history of revisions made to the existing text.
  
  Of course, Wikipedia does not answer to the 24-hour news cycle, making
  similar collaborative processes inappropriate for many news
  organizations. Moreover, editing opinion and analysis in this way seems
  beside the point as, in many instances, the very existence of a blog or
  extensive forum participation indicates the topicality and disputed
  nature of the subject. What such contributions need is not the sort of
  transparent fact-checking process offered by Wikipedia, but a less
  visible cogency-verifying one that ensures “good enough” standards of
  grammar, diction, logic and pointedness - a.k.a. effective and
  respectful communication - are obtained.
  
  This is unachievable, as any one who understands the vast,
  uncontrollable wilderness that is the World Wide Web knows. Personal
  websites and blogs are just that - personal - and the existing budgets
  of mainstream news organizations are likely to preclude the dedication
  of additional resources to monitoring dedicated spaces for readers post
  comments.
  
  This is not to say that news organizations could and should not make
  clear to consumers the differing levels of editorial input they dedicate
  to different sections of their output. Forum readers might be informed
  that no quality control measures are applied to their content or those
  of other contributors, while those clicking through to the letters page
  of an online newspaper could be informed of the quality parameters used
  to select and edit correspondence.
  
  Doing this may send a message to all internet surfers about the
  relationship between the accuracy and communicative value of content,
  and different sorts of editorial input. While greater transparency and
  accountability are key areas for improvement, the editorial oversight
  exercised by mainstream news organizations needs to be recognised as
  exercising important quality control over what we see, hear and read
  everyday.

  Since becoming Federal Health Minister, Tony Abbott has demonstrated a
  casual, at times even antagonistic, relationship with facts that don’t
  support his moral views. This week’s performance on Insiders continued
  this lamentable tradition. The Minister claimed that non-Government
  politicians supported “human cloning”, that the Government’s own expert
  panel recommended the creation of “human animal hybrids”, and that a
  private member’s bill sponsored by Senator Natasha Stott Despoja would
  “force” pro-life organisations to “refer people to abortion services”,
  and deny federal funding to those that didn’t.
  
  In fact, the Lockhart Committee, as well as every reputable scientists
  in the country, has supported a ban on reproductive cloning: the
  implantation in a woman’s womb of an embryo created in the lab using a
  technique called Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer. Senator Stott Despoja’s
  bill does not require any pregnancy counselling agency to refer a woman
  for an abortion. It simply demands that all services advertise in ways
  that make clear to women whether they are pro-life or pro-choice.
  
  It is noteworthy that while the Health Minister copped criticism from
  all sides for what Queensland Liberal MP Michael Johnson labeled
  “clearly inaccurate language”, and what Senator Stott Despoja described
  as either “confusion” or a deliberate attempt by the Minister to mislead
  the public, the Prime Minister is unconcerned. “Everybody can express
  their view”, he told ABC radio. “Tony Abbott should not be restricted in
  what he says just because he’s the Health Minister”.
  
  But this response misses the point. Abbott is not being condemned for
  what he believes, or for making his views plain, but for playing fast
  and loose with the facts: a problem that his status as Federal Minister
  for Health arguably makes worse.
  
  Exaggerating, sensationalising, decontextualising, misconstruing,
  mischaracterizing and misleading are all variations on the dishonesty
  charge. In one case, there is a hair to split. In response to concerns
  raised predominantly by pro-life groups that the demand for human eggs
  left women vulnerable to exploitation, the Lockhart committee did
  recommend a lifting of the ban on scientists pursuing the derivation of
  embryonic stem cells from somatic cell nuclear transfer undertaken on
  animal eggs. However, the recommendation clearly stipulates that such
  embryos “not [be] implanted into the body of a woman or allowed to
  develop for more than 14 days.” Hardly the living and breathing
  Transylvanian chimera evoked by the Health Minister’s “human animal
  hybrid” claim.
  
  But charges of inaccuracy must be upheld for the remainder of the
  Minister’s remarks. In fact, clarifications on the point the Minister
  fudged with regard to pregnancy counselling were repeatedly offered
  during hearings into the bill conducted around the nation last month.
  
  Some may see such criticism as beside the point. Isn’t the Health
  Minister’s only crime his willingness to be more open and honest than
  other politicians about this passions and biases? Surely, given the
  chance, all politicians attempt to shape law and policy to fit their
  ideals. Why else pursue power?
  
  This is true to a point. But use and abuse of power are two different
  things. Telling fibs to discredit one’s opponents and their case for
  change, not to mention relying on the prestige of high office to bolster
  one’s falsehoods, is just not cricket. Rather, it is a condemnable
  means-to-an-end strategy that disregards the rules for fair play in the
  service of winning at all costs.
  
  Further, those who operate in this fashion rule themselves out of the
  role of honest broker in the event that their preferred approach is not
  the one delivered by democratic processes. This has been the case with
  Abbott and the drug RU486. Having fought so hard, and at times unfairly,
  to prevent the removal of his ministerial veto over women’s access to
  the drug (phrases like “backyard miscarriage” and “pop and forget” pill
  peppered his contributions to the debate), significant questions hang
  over his capacity to impartially oversee the post-conscience-vote
  processes required to bring the drug to the market. In May, a
  pharmaceutical company executive revealed that the Minister and his
  office threatened his company with adverse consequences if it applied to
  register the drug in Australia.
  
  “The thing I enjoy most as a politician,” Tony Abbott said recently, “is
  the opportunity to be taken seriously when you say something”.
  
  Too right. And with such power comes responsibility. Tony Abottt is no
  fool. He’s more than capable of getting across a brief, if this is what
  he wishes to do. Minister Abbott’s failure to get the facts right when
  issues of gender, reproduction and sexuality are at stake undermines the
  quality of public debate on such matters.
  
  It also casts doubt not just on his fitness for high office, but the
  wisdom of the man who keeps him there.

  For me, the news of Steve Irwin’s death caused a Diana moment: the
  molasses, freeze-time moment of shock that sears whatever one was doing
  - going to lunch, cleaning the fridge, having a shower - on one’s
  consciousness for ever. I sat at my computer and cried.
  
  Why has Irwin’s death hit many of us so hard? In the rush to eulogise
  him, several explanations of what he meant to Australia and Australians
  have been served up. According to the Opposition Leader, Irwin was the
  “quintessential Aussie Battler” who was a “terrific exponent of
  Australian larrikin values”. Those in the tourist trade - at times
  seeming sadder about the loss of a product than a person - proclaimed
  him the “ambassador” for Queensland and Australia.
  
  This is rubbish and, ironically just the sort that was responsible for
  the subdued response some Australians had to the Crocodile Hunter when
  compared to the untrammelled celebrity he enjoyed in the US. Few
  national groups, Australians included, are going to take kindly to being
  represented at home or abroad by a single individual, no matter who they
  are or what they do. Such resistance is only likely to increase when the
  summary of national identity includes phrases like sunburnt, rugged,
  over-the-top and oafish, not necessarily in that order.
  
  Irwin never claimed to represent Australia or Australians overseas, or
  to in any way summarise how we think or who we are. The reality, which
  he knew better than anyone, was that he was about as far from the
  quintessential Australian as you could get: a bush dweller and
  conservationist in a land of confirmed suburbanites indifferent to their
  ever-expanding environmental footprints; a warp-speed extravert whose
  chosen adverbs of degree - absolutely, extremely, really - contrasted
  tellingly to the preference of his compatriots for somewhat, rather and
  “a bit”. In a telling interview with Andrew Denton in 2003, replayed on
  ABC TV last night as a tribute, Irwin frankly acknowledged the
  embarrassment he caused his compatriots. I’m embarrassing, he explained
  because “there’s a little bit of me in everybody”. In addition, what
  Irwin called the “yeah, yeah, take it or leave it” attitude of Aussies
  to everything, made them uncomfortable with his passionate embrace of
  everything.
  
  He may have only got it half right. As far as I can see, there’s way too
  little of Irwin in most of us. Not only do we know it, we work damn hard
  to keep it that way, for precisely the reasons Irwin nominates: our fear
  of appearing too invested in or excited about anything. It’s all
  terribly English, really. Being so relaxed we’re horizontal is a highly
  esteemed Australian characteristic, and if the upshot of our commitment
  to indifference is a loss of our own passion for the things that really
  matter to us, and a disdain for the untrammelled enthusiasm of others,
  than so be it.
  
  Are we afraid of failure? This is the classic analysis of those afraid
  of trying too hard, but I think what stymies us is more pedestrian: a
  fear of the unpredictable and potentially uncomfortable social
  situations that could result if people drop roles and abandon lines.
  Wild, larger-than-life characters like Irwin - hyper-extraverts - are
  unpredictable; you never know what they might say or do. They could ask
  you for something you don’t want to give, or beg conflict by saying
  something you don’t want to hear. They must be subdued through ridicule
  or marginalisation, or frozen out completely to manage our collective
  fear of the awkward moment.
  
  Americans have no such fear, and this may partially explain their
  unequivocal hero-worship of Irwin. In fact, I suspect the real source of
  American’s love-affair with Irwin was not what made him Australian, but
  the Americanness of much of his personality. Hyper-extraversion, and its
  superlative sidekicks of uncontained passion and enthusiasm, are what
  Americans love and admire about themselves. How flattering to see them
  emulated by the nation’s good friends Down Under, and in a cute Aussie
  accent to boot.
  
  It is perhaps testament to the complexity of the Australian character
  that while Irwin’s energy and passion made us anxious, we also admired
  it. Many, myself included, couldn’t help but feel terribly fond of the
  man. As he told Denton, he was the boy who never grew up, and we
  couldn’t help but smile at his boundless enthusiasm and energy,
  childlike faith in his invincibility when it came to animal stings or
  bites, and his inability to be other than himself or to even waste time
  trying.
  
  He was one out of the box, and I know I’m going to miss him like hell.

  Last Thursday, a number of female scientists stormed out of the dinner
  of a government- funded conference on climate change. They were outraged
  at the choice of a scantily-clad, all-woman burlesque troupe that
  included one performer covered with balloons that conference
  participants were invited to pop - as entertainment.
  
  For the academic who drew the news media’s attention to what one
  attendee frankly described as “a mess”, the problem was clear. “This is
  … supposed to be a gathering of scientists at a government-sponsored
  event in an already male-dominated industry where it is hard enough for
  a woman to make inroads.” Her comments implied that in this context,
  there was little that was amusing, and much that was damaging, in the
  raucous display of semi-naked female bodies.
  
  The fishnet-stockinged troupe leader Rebecca Gale, a.k.a “Miss Kitka”,
  disagrees. Gale claims that burlesque is not “as degrading and as
  backward leading for women” as its critics claim. Not only had she
  invited some of the “ladies” to pop her balloons, but the show’s
  emphasis on tease rather than nudity, and the fact that all the
  performers were neither 18 years old nor “blonde with big boobs” proved
  its non-sexist credentials.
  
  Gale might also have pointed to the history of burlesque as further
  evidence as its right-on credentials. Originating in the early Victorian
  era when tensions between the aristocracy and working-class were high,
  burlesque saw performers in outfits considered inappropriate for polite
  society mock high-brow entertainment forms as opera, Shakespearean
  drama, musicals, and ballet. However, just before the crackdown in the
  1930s that saw the genre disappear, burlesque had been reduced to little
  more than strip shows where young, rural, poverty-stricken gals got
  their kit off for money. Revived as part of the retro- craze of the
  1990s, its continued flourishing at the start of the 21st may be
  attributable to the rise of “raunch” culture.
  
  Is burlesque sexist? While there is little doubt that on some issues we
  can agree to disagree, I’m unconvinced this is one of them. This is
  because like the charge of racism, sexism is not a trivial accusation,
  but a highly charged moral one that stamps “oppressive” (burdensome,
  arbitrary, unjust and/or tyrannical exercise of power) on the accused.
  Those making such accusations, in other words, have an obligation to
  believe they have truth, not just opinion, on their side.
  
  If any form of sexual entertainment is deemed inappropriate at all
  serious work-related events, than in this context burlesque - as well as
  pole and belly-dancing - stands condemned. But if burlesque is not just
  sexual but sexist, than like minstrel shows in which white actors
  blackened their faces and lampooned stereotypical depictions of blacks,
  its suitability as entertainment in any context must be questioned.
  
  With all due respect to Ms Gale, it is unclear to me why the fact that
  female audience members received the same number of invitations to pop
  her balloons defends against the charge of sexism. Would anyone
  seriously argue that because the mothers often wrapped and unwrapped the
  cloth that crippled their young daughters’ feet, that the ancient
  Chinese practice of foot binding was not gender-based oppression?
  
  And while many of us applaud the expansion of forums in which female
  physical types other than young, blonde and busty are sexualised,
  amending this aspect of our culture’s eroticisation of women does not
  necessarily, or on its own, empower us. As well, while the ways in which
  women are constructed as hot or not matters, it must at least take equal
  place beside the important feminist goal of defending a woman’s right to
  occupy public space and garner public respect regardless of whether men
  find her horny.
  
  Of course, for some women, the infiltration of burlesque, belly-dancing
  and other traditional womanly arts is proof-positive that we no longer
  need to worry about this problem. Who else but women supremely confident
  that they are taken seriously as citizens and fully-rounded human beings
  at home, at school and at work would dare to reintroduce dress and dance
  forms that throughout history has been emblematic of the highly
  constrained ways women had to arouse recognition, interest and approval
  from men. Surely, some young women may feel, the creation of a world in
  which women are free to introduce the all-too-human yen to be seen as
  desirable in their everyday persona, without fear of misogynist
  stereotyping and career death, was what the feminist revolution was all
  about.
  
  Well, wresting our fair share of financial and political freedom and
  power from men in order to gain greater control of our lives was in
  there, too. And while some burlesque performers defend the female nature
  of the sexuality expressed by the genre (more foreplay, less
  in-your-face T & A) there seems little that’s new in either the glitter
  and tassel of the cleavage-focused costumes, or the manner in which the
  performers strut around in them. Real sexual freedom, notes author of
  Female Chauvinist Pigs Ariel Levy, requires us to figure out what we
  internally want from sex instead of mimicking whatever popular culture"
  - of any era I might add - “holds up to us as sexy.”
  
  There’s a time and a place for everything, and that includes feeling
  sexy and finding someone else hot. Burlesque had its time and place,
  too. The challenge for contemporary women is to find ways of being
  “sexy” - of inviting desire and desiring - that do not call on gendered
  stereotypes from an unequal past, nor succumb to a market-based
  universalisation of desire.

  *People should have the right to make choices about their own deaths.*
  
  Earlier this week Senator Amanda Vanstone re-opened the euthanasia
  debate by opining in a newspaper interview that it was inhumane to
  deprive Australians of “sane sensible and humane euthanasia laws”.
  
  The arguments the palliative care movement make against euthanasia are
  similar to those made by the anti-choice movement against abortion. This
  is unsurprising , given the religious origins of both schools of though
  of late, both have taken what one scholar describes as a decidedly
  “secular turn”.
  
  Both movements argue that the only reason why those they claim to
  represent - women and terminally ill patients - choose as they do is
  because both groups lack adequate knowledge of other alternatives. If
  only woman knew about Centrelink parenting payments, and the terminally
  ill recognised the improvements in pain management, the demand for
  abortion and physician assisted suicide would disappear.
  
  Both movements also question the decision-making competence of those
  choosing abortion and physician-assisted suicide. Female pregnancy
  hormones and the poor physical and mental health status of terminally
  ill patients, not to mention the stress of crisis decision-making, are
  deemed legitimate reasons to doubt the rationality - and disregard the
  choices - of those pursuing control over their bodies and their deaths.
  Palliative care providers, argues a recent article in Palliative
  Medicine, deem all patients who “think that their life is irretrievably
  bad” to be “wrong”.
  
  Finally, both advocacy groups suggest that the availability of more
  options has the counter-intuitive outcome of reducing choice. The mere
  availability of abortion and physician-assisted suicide, the argument
  runs, coerces women and terminally ill-patients to “choose it” so as to
  avoid burdening others with their need. Real choice, it is claimed,
  requires the continued criminalisation of abortion and
  physician-assisted suicide so that more legitimate options like adoption
  and palliative care can flourish.
  
  So what is the truth? Surveys across the western world, including
  Australia, clearly show support for a right to die. A 2002 Gallup poll
  found 72% of Americans supported doctor-assisted suicide for those with
  terminal illnesses, while in the same year 70% of Australians were found
  to be in favour of giving terminally ill and severely suffering people a
  choice about the timing and method of their death.
  
  Data from Oregon suggests that the most frequently given reasons for
  choosing physician-assisted suicide by the approximately 30 people who
  die this way every year are loss of autonomy" (87%), “loss of dignity”
  (80%) and “loss of the ability to enjoy the activities that make life
  worth living” (84%). This data, which suggests that mental rather than
  physical suffering is the main driver of decisions to die, undermines
  the assertion of anti-euthanasia forces that the effectiveness of
  modern-day palliative methods obviates the need for legal reform.
  
  Such figures also undercut claims that the legal freedom to die would
  exert the greatest coercive pressure on those lacking options other than
  death: namely, the ill-educated and those too poor to afford palliative
  care. The overwhelming majority of Oregonians seeking physician-assisted
  suicide were highly educated and well off. Indeed, 86% were enrolled in
  hospice care at the time of their suicides, while only 2 of the 208
  people who have used the legislation so far were uninsured.
  
  There are some values that palliative care and right to die advocates
  share. These include a belief in the importance of reducing human
  suffering and a distaste for the over-medicalisation of the dying
  process.
  
  However, disagreements between the two groups are profound. They include
  theoretical disputes about the legitimacy of death as a choice as well
  as more empirically-based spats about the competence and capacity of the
  terminally ill to make adequately informed decisions, and the likely
  effect of making physician-assisted suicide a legal choice. Palliative
  care advocates see decriminalisation as an invitation to what Melbourne
  writer Juliette Hughes (Opinion, 13/7) recently described as a culture
  of death that would enable the preferences of greedy relatives and
  stingy hospital bureaucrats to be privileged above those of vulnerable
  patients. In contrast, advocates for physician-assisted suicide believe
  safeguards can be put in place to protect patient-autonomy and reduce
  the risks of involuntary euthanasia: risks currently managed in
  secretive and ad hoc ways. One survey found that while 30% of all
  Australian deaths involving a medical decision designed to end the
  patient’s life, only 4% of these decisions were in response to a direct
  request from the patient.
  
  Some Australians speed and drive drunk. Yet few would seriously moot the
  criminalisation of driving as a solution to this undeniably serious
  problem.
  
  Instead, as we do to minimise the risk of irresponsible driving to self
  and others, we must move to enact sophisticated regulatory and
  compliance regimes around end of life decisions. Ones that will offer
  those of us who meet threshold conditions for competence to exercise our
  reason and our values when it comes to critical decisions about our
  bodies, our lives and our deaths.

  *This article ran in the Sydney Morning Herald essay series celebrating
  the paper’s 175th anniversary.*
  
  TEASE: Do multiculturalism and feminism mix? What about feminism and
  religious freedom?
  
  One could be forgiven for having doubts. In a range of pluralist,
  liberal states - Australia included - pockets of cultural and religious
  minorities engage in practices that express limited views about the full
  humanity of women, and undermine equity between the sexes. From the
  insistence of pockets of Somali immigrants in the US on “circumcising”
  their infant girls, the refusal of parts of the Anglican and Catholic
  Churches to ordain women and the appeal to customary law by some
  Aboriginal men to justify child marriage and marital rape, some
  religious and cultural sub-communities persevere with practices that
  express particular views about “proper” roles for women rejected - in
  theory if not in practice - by the majority. When criticised, the
  defence that tends to be offered, nearly always by a male authority
  figure, is that what is being done is an inextricable part of “our
  culture”.
  
  The dilemma cannot be solved by a simple appeal to rights. This is
  because the right to pursue one’s own conception of the good life free
  from discrimination on the grounds of culture and of gender are
  important moral rights. Which should trump the other when they conflict?
  Political rights are similarly impotent in the face of this conflict,
  with many human rights conventions and anti-discrimination protocols
  enshrining gender equity as well as freedom of culture and religion. The
  seven core international human rights treaties, for example, include
  those that guarantee the right of self determination to all without
  regard to religion, as well as those that affirm the equal rights of men
  and women.
  
  So what should be done when the values we hold about cultural and
  religious diversity, and our beliefs about equality between the sexes,
  collide? A number of Australian politicians have recently made their
  views clear. Members of minority cultures or religions can either do as
  we do (or say we do) when it comes to gender equity, or go home. “If a
  person wants to live under Sharia law there are countries where they
  might feel at ease”, Treasurer Peter Costello recently informed
  Australia’s Muslim minority. “But not Australia”. In a speech to the
  Sydney Institute earlier this year, Victorian MP Andrew Robb argued that
  the successful integration of first and second generation Muslims into
  Australia was dependant on these Australians “demonstrat[ing] their
  comittment” to, among other things, the “Australian value” of equality
  between the sexes.
  
  Some supporters of multiculturalism - many of whom are feminists - have
  taken umbrage at such remarks, which have been interpreted as
  thinly-veiled racism against Australian Muslims. Certainly it was the
  first time many Australian feminists heard the fair, fat and fifty-ish
  men who run the nation even mention the word feminism, little less in
  such impassioned and unequivocal tones.
  
  Yet, beneath this discomfort may have lurked another: one grounded in
  the sure knowledge that however unjust the discrimination some minority
  groups suffer (the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission handled
  167 complaints of race discrimination in 2004~~05), such groups may also
  perpetrate injustice~~ systematically and unapologetically - against
  “their” girls and women. Whether it’s Muslim parents forcing their
  daughters overseas for an arranged marriage with an (often far older)
  co-religionist, Orthodox Jewish males thanking God daily for not making
  them women, or leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention instructing
  female congregants to “submit themselves graciously to the servant
  leadership of their husbands” and accept their ordained role of
  “managing the household and nurturing the next generation,” culture and
  religion are regularly used as defences for practices that demean,
  deprive, limit and otherwise oppress women.
  
  Ironically, at the same time as girls and women are burdened by the
  patriarchal attitudes of traditional religious and cultural communities,
  they are also seen as responsible for their preservation and
  perpetuation. According to one American study, the parents of young
  migrant women saw their daughters as more responsible than their sons
  for the positive representation and perpetuation of their culture and
  consequently legitimately subject to parental control when it came to
  what they wore, their participation in extracurricular and social
  activities, their future choices about education and employment and even
  their decisions about when and who to marry. While some girls openly or
  covertly flouted such restrictions, others submitted, despite what they
  admitted were high psychic, social and/or material costs. Philosopher
  Susan Okin tells a story of an Indian student facing a forced marriage
  that would preclude her graduation from high school. While the 17-year
  old admitted that her parents’ decision had “messed up” her dreams and
  plans, leaving her “tormented”, she bristled at her teacher’s suggestion
  that she might resist. “In our religion, we have to think of our parents
  first…I will do it the Muslim way”.
  
  For Okin, arguably the 20th century’s most eminent female philosopher,
  one solution to the clash between feminism and multiculturalism is to
  ensure female members of religious sub-groups have what she calls
  “realistic rights of exit”. Liberal pluralist societies like Australia
  should only tolerate the rights of minority groups to discriminate
  against women when those women are truly free to respond to such
  discrimination - and the more limited life aspirations and achievements
  they entail - to leave the group, and build an alterative life
  elsewhere. Small-l liberal states that do not guarantee this freedom to
  all their citizens are guilty of failing to protect women’s moral right
  to choice and control over their lives.
  
  But the right to escape a community that is oppressive is not enough.
  Gender-discriminatory cultures and religions have a profound impact on
  women’s beliefs about their legitimate entitlements in this life. If
  girls grow up hearing, as they do if they attend some private
  fundamentalist Christian schools, that their failure to accept a
  subordinate and obedient role in the home leaves the “doors open to
  Satan”, their opportunities to exit are significantly undermined. This
  is because, to rephrase the Rocky Horror Show’s Dr. Frank-N-Furter, if
  you can’t see it, you can’t be it. As a consequence, asserts Okin, where
  multicultural practices eviscerate the self-esteem necessary for girls
  and women to develop their own values and plans, the State is well
  within its bounds to outlaw them. This is particularly the case because
  the alternative - that oppressed women can either “lump it or leave” -
  not only deprives women of the opportunity to participate in and enjoy
  the positive aspects of their cultures, it more or less ensures the
  entrenchment in such cultures of gender-oppressive attitudes and
  behaviour. After all, if the women who object to them have no other
  option but to leave, it’s hard to see from where the force for change
  will come.
  
  An emphasis not just on the obligation of liberal states to equip girls
  and women from minority cultures to exit, but to ensure the conditions
  exist for them to stay, is likely to draw fierce resistance from some
  minority cultural and religious groups. The leaders of such groups may
  brand as culturally imperialist claims that particular practices (like
  distinctive and highly restrictive female dress and education
  emphasising traditional gender roles and sexual morality) are oppressive
  to women, and insist that “their” women freely choose to engage in them.
  Where practices less open to interpretation are at issue - like female
  genital mutilation, or forced child marriages - they may argue that
  cultural expression and survival must take priority over gender
  equality.
  
  Philosopher Ayelet Shachar has observed that “a disproportionate share
  of the costs of multiculturalism” is born by the most vulnerable groups
  in the community: children, women and homosexuals. Shachar’s point,
  obvious but often overlooked, is that minority cultural and religious
  groups are not homogeneous, but comprise less and more powerful members.
  This is something to keep in mind when the most powerful members insist
  on majority toleration of a practice that results in the least powerful
  copping it sweet.
  
  A focus on exit rights, and the conditions necessary to stay, is not
  really as radical as it may sound. When we insist that that the
  perpetrators of domestic violence, not the victims, leave the family
  home, or applaud court decisions that prohibit religious schools from
  firing married women because of their view that they belong at home, we
  endorse an Okin-esque view that a truly just society doesn’t just
  support its citizens to escape injustice by leaving, but helps them to
  fight it, so they can stay.
  
  It’s these battlers, after all, who make the world a more just place for
  us all.

  *Airing a dream is to criticise and negate the opposing vision*
  
  Ah, the good old F-word. For a while, things were looking grim. All that
  talk about irrelevance, betrayal of the young, even death. No one but
  the humourless hirsute holed up in the hallowed halls of
  higher-education had a good word to say about her.
  
  Now our dear old F-word is back, though the revolutionary being returned
  to us as a topic of decent conversation is not the gal we knew. She’s a
  kindler, gentler revolutionary with fewer enemies than a nun. She’s the
  New Feminism, a social movement that no longer causes discomfort or
  division by identifying female oppression or fighting to change the way
  the world is organised. The New Feminism speaks only in muted tones
  about how all women’s “choices” must be respected.
  
  The problem with New Feminism is that social movements must actually
  stand for something. Barracking for one vision of the good is to be
  opposed to its opposite. For something to be right, fair or good,
  something else must (at least in theory and arguably in practice) be
  wrong, unfair or bad. Second wave feminists weren’t backwards about
  coming forward with their views that attitudes and practices when it
  came to paid work and the care of children discriminated and oppressed
  women and were therefore wrong. It was on the basis of these unambiguous
  moral assertions that their demands for change were founded. It was also
  on this basis that opposition formed amongst those who disagreed with
  feminist descriptions of the problem, the movement’s preferred
  solutions, or both.
  
  Choice, as the forgoing should make clear, didn’t enter it. This is not
  to say that choice is not a legitimate part of what feminism is about in
  some instances. In particular, when it’s possible for everyone to have
  it regardless of their education level or financial resources, and when
  making one choice available to one person doesn’t denigrate or undermine
  the legitimacy of the choices made another. The freedom to choose
  abortion is a good example. It can be argued for without implying that
  women who go forward with an unplanned pregnancy, or choose motherhood
  at any other point in their lives, are doing the wrong thing.
  
  Would that it were always so easy. Feminists also argued that women and
  men should share the work of earning and of caring. They have claimed
  that social attitudes, policies and practices that make it hard for
  women to undertake paid work and for men to care are oppressive, and
  ought to be changed. Note such a claim is not about preference. It’s
  doesn’t say “I don’t like it, so you should change it.” Rather it is an
  assertion that the way we currently do things is morally wrong, and that
  doing the right thing requires us to change.
  
  What kinds of reasons did feminists give in support of their claim that
  change was required? They said it was only fair that women have the same
  educational and job opportunities as men, and be paid the same for the
  same work. They also claimed that children were harmed by men’s absence
  from the home (a concern now shared by the men’s movement).
  
  Such claims were never morally innocuous nor, consequently, reducible to
  matters of “choice.” If discrimination against women was unjust, than
  those who colluded or supported such discrimination were guilty of
  immoral behaviour. If children suffered as a consequence of the way
  labour was organised, than everyone who supported such arrangements -
  from society, to employers, to parents who lived that way when they had
  the ability to do otherwise - stood condemned. “Choice” never entered
  it.
  
  The old F-word was also fond of exposing the classist nature of choice.
  It was the feminists that everyone loved-to-hate who pointed out that
  under-the-garden-tree ponderings of the “should I return to work, or
  should I stay at home?” variety were available only to sisters whose
  husbands were loaded. For the rest of us (as well as for the vast
  majority of fathers who not only lack a decently-paid spouse but access
  to even the minimal parental-leave and part-time work options enjoyed by
  some mothers) the “choice” is academic, given the causal pairing of the
  stay-at-home option with the go-to-the-poorhouse one. Seen in this
  light, it’s clear that respect for individual choice offers few answers
  to most women and men struggling to solve the work/life crisis.
  
  We’d all like to get along famously and, on a personal level, we can. At
  the risk of recycling the oldest cliché in the book, one of my best
  friends is a stay-at-home mum. With the exception of the time we tried
  to discuss the White Wings advert (the one in which a school-girl
  extolling her mother’s philosophy of home-backing everything is told by
  her friend that her own mother doesn’t do that because she’s “got a
  life.”), there’s never been a cross word between us. Politically,
  however, such internecine peace - between conservative and revolutionary
  women; between the unselfconsciously wealthy and the rest - is
  impossible. Impossible, that is, without real feminists neutering our
  vision of a better world for women so radically that it renders us
  little more, and little better, than patriarchs without balls.
  
  Change requires a moral vision of the world as it should be; a vision
  that is, by definition, exclusionary. To state one’s dreams is to
  implicitly criticise and negate the opposing vision of others.
  
  Ah politics, it’s a bitch.

  Retiring sex discrimination commissioner Pru Goward’s parting comments
  on the unfettered capacity of the nation’s religious institutions to
  practise gender discrimination were the most interesting - and
  contentious - of her tenure.
  
  Despite the generous support of such institutions by the Australian
  Government through tax exemptions and funding for religious schools, the
  institutional and liturgical practices of the church show blithe
  disregard for federal laws that prohibit the unfair treatment of
  Australian women on the basis of their gender, marital or pregnancy
  status. “It’s a huge law-free zone,” said Goward.
  
  Her contrasting of the nation’s intolerance of practices that perpetuate
  inequality between the races, but laissez-faire attitude to parallel
  ones that allow gender inequity, is both acute and timely. Most
  Australians would agree that a religion that claimed that race was a
  legitimate ground for denying a congregant a leadership role in the
  church, or for physically segregating him from others during services
  was immoral, and should be unlawful.
  
  Yet, both victims of race and gender discrimination suffer attenuated
  aspirations and opportunities. Why should the law give a privilege to
  the rights of believers to be free of racial discrimination, but cry
  “religious tolerance” whenever complaints of gender discrimination are
  made? How can a nation that allows the nation’s churches to deny equal
  opportunity to women assert that gender equity is a fundamental Aussie
  value?
  
  One reason Australian lawmakers might see sexism, but not racism, as a
  lesser evil than the restriction of religious freedom is the integral
  role sexism plays in the Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Islam and
  Christianity.
  
  Race was a potent concept before and around the time of Jesus, but it
  was a voluntary category defined by the individual’s choice of faith.
  The contemporary understanding of race - as a set of inalterable and
  unchosen physical characteristics - does not feature in the Torah or the
  Gospels as a category that either inherently limits or expands an
  individual’s access to God. In practical terms, this means that not only
  does the enforcement of legal prohibitions on racism have little
  practical impact on the church’s teachings, but that the scriptures
  offer little to defend those who discriminate on grounds of race.
  
  Sadly, this is not the case for gender. While the fictional nature of
  much of Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code is beyond question, the general
  thesis about the determination of the first Christians to suppress the
  feminine is correct.
  
  Paul, in particular, seemed determined to ignore Jesus’s more
  gender-egalitarian bent and to pursue gentile converts to the new sect
  by impressing them with the modesty of Christian women. The ancient
  Hebrews bequeathed to the first Christians (most of whom came from pious
  Jewish backgrounds) a view of women as unclean creatures with no
  independent standing in the eyes of God. For women to be seen by God -
  the only way in such cultures for her to acquire social status - they
  must maintain dutiful familial relationships with men: fathers,
  brothers, husbands. The spinsters, widows and divorcees who lacked such
  relationships, or who, once engaged in them, failed to deliver virginity
  and later sons, risked being cast out from the community.
  
  There is evidence that such antiquated views of women continue to
  influence the contemporary practices of some Jewish, Christian and
  Muslim congregations. Whether it’s Orthodox Jews daily thanking God for
  not making them women, Muslim schools refusing to hire unmarried women,
  or Christian ones dismissing women when they became pregnant, Australian
  women of faith are subject to treatment that reflects limited views
  about their full humanity and denies them opportunities for no other
  reason than that they are female.
  
  Religious leaders are no amateurs when it comes to defending male
  privilege in the liturgy and hierarchy. “Our holy books command us to
  treat women this way,” they protest, conveniently forgetting the
  redundancy of scriptural commandments to stone adulterers, or forcibly
  marry rapists to their victims. Alternatively, they argue that if women
  weren’t content with second-class citizenship, they’d have fled the
  churches long ago.
  
  Would that it were so simple. As the recent expose on ABC’s Four Corners
  made clear, the fundamentalist Exclusive Brethren exact high costs -
  such as life-long separation from spouses and children - from those who
  exit. It is also unclear whether a guarantee of more realistic exit
  rights is a just response to unlawful discrimination by religious
  orders.
  
  Would we deem “lump it or leave” an acceptable response to Aboriginal
  Australians who complained that their church was denying them leadership
  positions and demanding they sit in pews at the back? Or would we feel
  that Aborigines have a right to membership in a church free of
  institutionalised racism.
  
  Sexism is just as eviscerating to the dignity, self-esteem, aspirations
  and opportunities of women as racism is to people of colour. It was the
  recognition of this fact that led to the passage of the Federal Sex
  Discrimination Act in 1984. More than 20 years later, it is high time
  its provisions were fully enforced.

  *Damaged children grow up to believe that only violence can change*
  
  Like most Australians I have been devastated by the unfolding tragedy in
  Russia. Or perhaps even more so. I have school age children, and like
  many parents, was overwhelmed with pity for those pacing helpless and
  unknowing outside the mined school building: Were their children
  thirsty? Hurt? Dead? I was similarly undone by the Jaiden Leskie case
  several years ago: Jaiden was the age of my youngest son when he
  disappeared.
  
  My fretfulness during the Beslan siege, and my mournful grief for the
  parents as they wail and bury their dead, is empathy: the emotion
  provoked in normal people by the suffering of others. It is the quality
  psychopaths and serial killers lack and, experts increasingly believe,
  one that must be nurtured during a child’s early years to develop
  properly. Chronic poverty, political powerlessness and social
  indifference: these are the social conditions that undermine the ability
  of parents to raise adults with the capacity to feel the pain of others,
  and to live peacefully in society as one of us. These same conditions
  foster the belief amongst such damaged children that violence is the
  only salve for their pent-up anger and frustration, and the only route
  to change.
  
  There can be no forgiveness of what the Beslan terrorists did to the
  children and parents of that town. Nor does there need to be. They have
  violated the most sacred responsibility of adults to children - to
  protect them and offer them a future - and in doing so have made them,
  indeed all of us, feel like failures. Justice, rough or otherwise, is
  more than they deserve.
  
  But how best to honour the dead and the children who survived? How do we
  make it up to them? Their parents will do the small things: hold them
  when they cry, soothe their restless sleep. Mother Russia is already
  talking tough about beefed-up security, leading some to fear a return to
  Soviet-style oppression.
  
  Will this make the children feel safe? Perhaps, but perhaps not - it’s
  never held much water with my kids. Even a ten-year old understands it
  only takes one terrorist to slip through the net for tragedy to occur.
  
  It’s normal, understandable and entirely forgivable for individuals and
  societies who’ve suffered in Beslan, after Bali and on 9/11 to want
  retribution. But more for practical reasons than moral ones, an eye for
  an eye will never be the answer. In the past many Irish terrorists, and
  Palestinian ones today, were the terrorized children of yesterday,
  retaliating against someone - anyone - for the sudden and traumatic
  death of a loved one that sometimes took place before their eyes. It is
  said the claimed organiser of the Beslan siege lost 11 family members in
  a Russian assault on Chechnya. And so it goes. In the end, an eye for an
  eye just leaves blind, toothless and scared to death.
  
  Giving our children a future demands we adults do the hardest thing
  there is: insist on seeing the terrorists as human. Yes, it’s easier to
  dismiss them as “animals” and [fanatics]() inexplicably severed from
  normal human emotions and aspirations; monsters at birth who were never
  like us. But until we recognise terrorists as the sharp-edge of icebergs
  of social deprivation and despair, their distorted humanity sourced in
  some real-world trauma that could have been different and could still
  change, it is we who lose.
  
  This is no Christian turn the other cheek, nor an argument for
  forgiveness and understanding. Those who perform terrorist acts deserve
  neither. Nor is it the soft-end of an either/or solution that has better
  crisis response and heightened security at the other pole. In the short
  term at least, we must do both.
  
  Instead, it is a pragmatic approach to seeing our way clear to another
  sort of future for the children of Beslan, and our children, too. A
  future where it is possible to feel safe, to trust others and to plan
  for the future. Not because there are more security checks and
  razor-wire. But because we live in a world that doesn’t make terrorists
  any more.

  *The challenge for feminists is to beat a system that still stifles
  them*
  
  There is a self-flagellatory streak in feminist books these days. The
  underlying message is that the biggest problem contemporary women face
  is that “feminists” didn’t tell them that they couldn’t “have it all”,
  rather than the fact that even in our so-called equal-opportunity world,
  they still can’t.
  
  This rush to blame may be a sign of larger and more fundamental - even
  fatal - problems affecting the women’s and other progressive social
  movements. As Carmen Laurence put it recently on Compass, such movements
  have failed to offer an understanding of the nature and purpose of
  society to counter the individualistic market-based philosophy of
  liberal capitalist countries like the UK, the US and Australia: a
  philosophy that says the role of the individual is to compete with
  others for access to the means to buy more stuff.
  
  At the heart of the liberal world view is a vision of individuals
  competing on a level playing field for the freedom to make whatever
  choices they like, as long as these don’t interfere with the similar
  freedom of others. This view implies that the unhappiness of any group
  must be a consequence of their bad choices: choices for which they have
  no one to blame but themselves. They could, and should, have chosen
  better.
  
  Enter the politics of informed consent which, in the Liberal world-view,
  provides one of the few ways those who’ve made bad choices can escape
  blame. From the feminist health movement to the more recent co-option of
  feminist health principles by abortion foes, defenders of informed
  consent assert that choices are only legitimate if they are made free
  from coercion and in the face of substantial understanding of the
  relevant facts. Indeed, the claim that women didn’t know because they
  weren’t told - and so aren’t to blame for their choices - is at the
  heart of post-feminist complaints like Haussegger’s.
  
  But while informed consent is a necessary tool for the protection of
  individual autonomy, political movements based on nothing more than the
  fostering of individual choice have a slim chance of success, despite
  the promotion of this sort of approach by commentators like Miranda
  Devine as the basis of a “new feminism”. This is because, “choice to do
  what?” will always be the next question that’s asked, and not all
  choices are the same. We don’t allow people to sell themselves into
  slavery, no matter how informed or voluntary they declare themselves to
  be, nor do we have much respect for the mega-rich who freely and
  knowledgeably reject all philanthropic appeals.
  
  Another well-worn route out of this conundrum is for progressives to
  show the falsity of liberal claims that the gladiatorial contest for
  purchasing power takes place on level playing field. However, the
  culture wars clearly showed how such an approach can be effectively
  castigated for encouraging a “culture of complaint”, a “black-armband”
  view of the world or a “victim mentality” in which excuses rather than
  action rule the day. This does not mean that progressives can’t, or
  shouldn’t, continue to point to the significant gap between the promise
  of liberal capitalism and what it delivers. But they should do so in the
  knowledge that while negative campaigns may undermine an opponent, they
  provide little succour for the alternative. Perhaps this is why the
  majority of Australians have granted control of both houses of
  parliament to a market-worshipping government while at the same time
  telling researchers that Australian society puts too much emphasis on
  money and not enough on the things that really matter.
  
  What is the answer? Progressives must make the critique of the market’s
  capacity to deliver happiness a first order priority. Once able to meet
  the basics of life, additional money doesn’t increase our feelings of
  well-being, as the 23% of Australians who’ve already downshifted to a
  time-rich and money-poor alternative clearly understand. As well,
  progressives must exploit what religion, philosophy and the social
  sciences all confirm are powerful sources of human motivation and
  happiness - family, community, identity, solidarity, security, trust,
  love, creativity, mastery, autonomy and fairness - to articulate an
  alternative objective for Australian society. We want to feel good about
  ourselves, which entails spending time with family, feeling part of our
  communities, acting with integrity and in accordance with the values we
  see as implicated in a meaningful life.
  
  We know that what the continental Europeans disdainfully regard as
  Anglo-Saxon liberalism is not the answer, and that consumerism has been
  a wash-out too. But before we can step off the wheel, we’re going to
  need a vision of where we’re headed and someone to show the way. It is
  the job of social progressives to articulate a vision and to answer the
  all important question of how we can get there from here.

  *Women must play and active role in protecting their sexual and
  reproductive health*
  
  Last week the Evening Standard reported the findings of a study linking
  \
  use of the Pill with infertility. The British study found that former
  Pill users took twice as long to conceive than those who had used
  condoms, with those overweight, over thirty-five or with a history of
  irregular periods most likely to be affected. Nevertheless, less than a
  week later Australian experts were hailing the release of a new Pill
  that will allow women to reduce their periods to four times a year as
  providing long overdue relief from the unnecessary “pain and
  inconvenience” of a monthly bleed.
  
  Women are likely to greet these latest findings, and the continued mixed
  messages from the medical profession about how best to manage their
  reproductive health, with the same feelings of confusion and outrage
  that greeted last year’s belated findings that ingesting combination HRT
  pills to prevent heart disease was not only a waste of time, but a clear
  risk to overall health. Indeed, the anger of infertile women upon
  learning this news is likely to be particularly keen, as the medical
  profession has been swearing for years that the Pill has no negative
  impact on future fertility.
  
  But how justified are the explosions of female bewilderment and rage
  that follow media reports of new medical information and, in their wake,
  revised medical advice? Are medical scientists in general, and
  prescribing doctors in particular, really to blame for getting it wrong
  in the first place, or must women also accept some blame for the health
  consequences of the drugs they choose to ingest?
  
  The truth is somewhere in between.
  
  On the one hand, there is frighteningly little public discussion of the
  imposed and necessary limits of the testing procedures all new drugs
  must undergo before being approved for use in Australia. Most patients,
  for instance, would be shocked to discover that many of the drugs their
  GPs prescribe have not been properly evaluated, either for safety or
  effectiveness, for the condition and/or the type of patient for whom
  they are prescribed. For instance, when doctors began advising all
  menopausal women to take HRT (rather than the ones with acute menopausal
  symptoms originally targeted by the drug) there was no good research
  that it would reduce women’s risk of heart disease. That’s right, you
  heard me. Absolutely none.
  
  Before doctors prescribe for particular patients, they should ensure
  that high quality evidence exists that the drug will be both safe and
  effective for that particular patient. As respected medical journalist
  Ray Moynihan has pointed out, problems often arise when doctors begin
  prescribing drugs tested on, say, critically ill middle-aged white men,
  to patients of all ages and sexes who present with far milder forms of
  the condition. In addition, doctors need to pay attention to whether the
  trials have adequately large sample sizes, are randomised and controlled
  (the gold standard in medical research) and independently conducted
  (rather than drug-company sponsored). Finally, they must be far more
  upfront with patients about what isn’t known about a particular drug.
  The impact of ongoing use is a big one here, simply because when a drug
  is new, or being prescribed for a new condition, even if someone has had
  the interest, foresight and financial capacity to study its long term
  effects, the results won’t be known for years.
  
  With most major medical journals available through on-line prescription,
  there are few excuses for doctors not to provide patients with
  up-to-the-minute information about the drugs they recommend.
  
  But women, too, have a role to play in getting and staying well. Before
  we swallow anything, particularly over months and years, we must ask our
  doctors about what is, and is not, known about their risks and benefits
  for a patient like us and what the quality is of the available evidence.
  And, if such answers are not forthcoming, we must pursue them ourselves.
  After all, it is our bodies and lives that will be affected - sometimes
  critically and for life - if we fail to act. Mostly, we must assume that
  in many instances when we swallow pharmaceuticals - especially in the
  long term - we are part of a (usually unacknowledged) experiment into
  their costs and benefits.
  
  Perhaps if we kept this in mind, many of us would choose to take fewer
  pills, and less of the ones we do. Instead, we might choose to take only
  those pharmaceuticals we really need, only when less-risky treatment
  alternatives aren’t available.

  Here, there, women crying “rape” are everywhere. I worry about the
  sudden onslaught of rape charges. Of course, I support a woman’s right
  to raise her grievances publicly and have them addressed in a legitimate
  forum, but I worry that others might not. The men being named are
  sporting heroes, and it wasn’t all that long ago that author Helen
  Garner questioned the legitimacy of young women bringing charges of
  sexual assault, both because of serious damage the resulting publicity
  had on the man’s reputation, and because she felt it was the job of
  young women to take responsibility for the effect their sexuality had on
  the opposite sex.
  
  For those feeling cynical about the sudden onslaught of allegations, it
  is critical to understand that “date-rape” charges come in waves for
  good reason. Unless they have been violated by a bush-leaping,
  balaclava-clad stranger, women tend to doubt themselves when it comes to
  labelling a disturbing, violative or even abusive sexual encounter as
  assault. Was it really rape, they wonder, if I flirted with the guy
  earlier than evening, was drinking, had a short skirt on, consented to
  all forms of petting short of intercourse?
  
  Even if they are savvy enough to know that no one - no matter what she
  said, wore or did - asks to be raped, they may worry others will
  disbelieve their story, or claim that they did. This is where other
  women speaking out is critical. When others tell their story and have
  their complaints taken seriously, those keeping silent gain the courage
  to speak, too.
  
  The media, police, and the clubs deserve credit, in other words (with
  the exception of St Kilda, who having spoken only to the two accused
  have now publicly declared themselves 100% behind their “boys”) for
  responding appropriately to the women’s charges, and therefore
  encouraging other women to emerge from the shadows.
  
  But the avalanche of accusations has another cause too, one which I
  think testifies to the success of feminism, and bodes well for gender
  relations in the future. Many of the women making charges against
  players are from Generation X and even Y - young women in their twenties
  and thirties - who see as their birthright to either receive respect
  from the opposite sex, or to demand it. These confident, assertive women
  have come of age with the knowledge that no man has the right to use
  either his advantage in strength or power to disadvantage her; either in
  the bedroom or the office. When men do abuse either, they see little
  problem in bringing them to account.
  
  It is hard to see how such forthright attitudes from young women, if
  widespread and sustained enough, will not fundamentally alter the
  behaviour of young men. After all, the whole reason gender relations are
  so fraught is that men and women want and need each other: they want and
  need each other in bed, to build the long-term intimate relationships so
  fundamental to their emotional well-being, and to form and raise
  families. This means that when one gender change the rules, the other -
  no matter how much they moan and complain - has little choice but to
  adjust their ways. If women won’t sleep with or marry men until they are
  treated with respect on all relevant turfs, in other words, then men
  will start seeing their role in the attainment of equality for women as
  a bread and butter issue.
  
  Renegotiated power relations between the sexes are to be welcomed, to a
  point. While Australians rightly don’t want to wind up where many
  American college men felt they were during the 1990s - needing a signed
  consent form before they could safely have sex with a woman - we do want
  all sexual engagements to be conducted with an awareness not only of the
  exciting and unpredictable frisson of Eros, but of the potential that
  unequal power and intoxication has for causing misunderstanding, and the
  importance of mutual respect, open communication and excellent listening
  skills.
  
  When men understand that women who bring their stories of abuse into the
  open will be heard, it will go a long way to redress the power imbalance
  in sexual encounters. This will particularly be the case in
  relationships between high profile athletes and their fans, that are so
  often the cause of trouble.

  Should arguments stand or fall on their merit? Or is it critical that
  media consumers get full, accurate and relevant information about who is
  providing facts, or offering opinion, about matters of public interest?.
  
  It may be nice to think the quality of ideas - not those who promulgate
  them determines their persuasiveness, but the reality is more
  complicated. A pro- nuclear argument made by a mining magnate will be
  evaluated differently to the exact same one made by an environmental
  activist, professor of nuclear physics, or the CEO of International
  Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War.
  
  And rightly so. The credentials of individuals and organsisations
  provide us with important clues about the expertise and motives of those
  seeking to influence us. They give us the chance to evaluate for
  ourselves whether an individual or organisation’s contribution is
  influenced by memberships, affiliations or sources of funding and, if we
  believe it is, to adjust the weight we give to those views accordingly.
  
  Motivations are complex and hidden. Political parties regularly discount
  the possibility that corporate donors purchase influence over party
  policies. Thinktanks poo-poo the idea that their spiritual or financial
  relationships with religious, political or corporate donors influence
  their views on matters of public interest, insisting that instead donors
  simply give to those who share their views.
  
  But unless full, accurate and relevant information on these
  relationships are disclosed, how can we make up our own minds?
  
  We can’t. And the truth is that some who seek to influence us believe
  that some ways of identifying themselves increase the credibility of
  their message. Regrettably, on the basis of this belief, some provide
  credentials and make disclosures that are at incomplete, misleading or
  irrelevant.
  
  Editorial space is preferred over advertising space by those who want to
  get their message across, as was clearly revealed by the Cash for
  Comment saga. The reason is simple. The views of journalists, academics,
  scientists and doctors are presumed to be the consequence of sustained
  and dispassionate analysis, not prior commitments, loyalties or the hope
  of financial advantage. This impartiality gives credibility to their
  views unavailable to those with known religious, corporate or political
  commitments, or who stand to make money from opinion being shaped one
  way instead of another.
  
  This may explain why some organizations choose scholarly sounding names
  like “centres”, “institutes” and "think-tanks, The reality, however, is
  that unlike academics, the staff of such organizations will not be
  required to have advanced degrees, nor adhere to the rigorous standards
  for quality research required to publish in academic journals.
  
  Many think-tanks are reticent about disclosing who funds them, and their
  employees can be slack in ensuring past political affiliations are a
  consistent feature of their bios. We do know that Philip Morris and BAT
  donated to the Institute of Public Affairs, which takes the view that
  passive smoking is not based on science. Director of the Sydney
  Institute, Gerard Henderson does not always disclose, when he opines
  about the Australian political scene, that he spent two years as John
  Howard’s chief of staff.
  
  Academic gloss is not the only quality sought by those seeking
  influence. A connection with the “little guy” - community-based or
  grass-roots activists - also lends credibility to messages the big end
  of town (corporate Australia, political parties or the churches) want us
  to hear.
  
  [According to
  Sourcewatch](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Institute_of_Public_Affairs#Front_Groups),
  The Institute of Public Affairs contributed to the establishment of a
  number of front groups, including the Australian Environment Foundation,
  which campaigns for weaker environmental laws and Independent
  Contractors of Australia, which campaigns for an end to workplace safety
  laws and the deregulation of the labour market.
  
  Such “astroturfing” (the creation or nurture of individuals or groups
  that falsely inflate “public” opinion) may be behind the newfound
  popularity amongst longstanding pro-life organizations and activists of
  re-badging themselves for every campaign they undertake against abortion
  and embryonic stem cell research. Well-known anti-choice activists and
  several women with links to Opus Dei recently became directors of
  Women’s Forum Australia, which asserts feminist grounds for opposing the
  drug regulator’s control over RU486, transparent advertising
  requirements for pregnancy counselling organizations and stem cell
  research. The Coalition Against the Decriminalisation of Abortion seems
  like a new pro-life grass roots organisation, but shares a mailing
  address with Catch the Fire Ministries. In its first year of operation,
  Cadoa found around $34,000 to fund anti-decriminalisation newspaper ads.
  
  What can be done? The code of ethics binding journalists requires them
  to be honest, to refrain from suppressing or distorting relevant facts,
  to refuse to allow personal interest, or any belief, commitment,
  payment, gift or benefit to undermine their independence and to disclose
  conflicts of interest that affect - or could be seen to affect - their
  independence.
  
  Perhaps the time has come for other media participants to be asked to
  conform to similar ethical standards. Anyone who really wishes to
  conduct their dealings transparently shouldn’t find it too hard to work
  out what disclosures are required.
  
  Beyond this, the best the public and decision-makers can do is to
  approach the credentials and disclosures offered by media players with
  skepticism. They may be complete, accurate and relevant. Then again,
  they may not.

  can’t win with this guy. First he tells them that if they don’t put out,
  he’d going to “put them out,” while in the next breath he’s dismissing
  them as beneath contempt for sleeping with him on the same day they met.
  The rap superstar is also pretty direct about his lack of respect for
  women who offer to worship at his alter (if you get my drift) when all
  they know about him is that he’s lead singer of a band.
  
  It sort of reminds me of the excuses being made for the male athletes
  accused of sexual assault: that when women keep throwing themselves at
  them, what can you expect such virile blokes to do?
  
  It’s happening again. In the media and across popular entertainment,
  young women are being informed - in ways subtle and no so - that they’re
  acting like sluts. They are being told in no uncertain terms that if
  they “give” sex to a guy just because he’s the lead cock in the coop,
  they’re “dissing” themselves. And if women lack respect for themselves,
  how can they expect men will respect them.
  
  The message seems to be that if young women are going to stay out late
  with their skirts up to pussy’s bow and their tongues hanging out, they
  shouldn’t be surprised when all they find is trouble.
  
  How fair is the slut charge? It’s certainly accurate to say that some
  young women engage in casual sex with high status men. I’ve got male
  friends who are or have been musicians. The stories they tell about
  their female fans make Eminem’s tales seem tame.
  
  But if women cheapen themselves by having brief and loveless encounters
  with men they don’t know but are attracted to for superficial reasons,
  then so do men. What’s the difference between a woman who “gets with” a
  guy because he’s high status, and a bloke bedding a woman because he
  likes her breasts, her long legs or the winning way she laughs at his
  unfunny jokes. The bottom line, in other words, is that if young women
  are acting like sluts, then young men are too.
  
  The real question is whether both sexes ought to be condemned for
  sluttish behaviour. Whether as a society, we ought to condemn as
  possibly risky but certainly unwise, sex between young people that is
  devoid of emotional intimacy, trust, responsibility, mutuality and
  respect? If we ought to say loudly and clearly to young people (or
  perhaps all people) that it is foolhardy to engage in one of the most
  physically intimate acts of which humans are capable with people we
  don’t know well, or to whom we are attracted for the shallowest of
  reasons?
  
  I’m in two minds about this. On the one hand, I feel sure there are some
  young people, as well as older ones, who can not only handle the costs
  but truly enjoy the benefits of what Erica Jong famously referred to as
  the zipless fuck. Why should people be made to feel bad if all they want
  at a particular time of their life is casual sex, as long as they are
  ruthlessly honest about this with their partners and make sure a condom
  is at hand?
  
  On the other hand, I remain skeptical that for most people, most of the
  time, sex is ever that easy. There is good evidence that human beings
  are hard-wired to connect physical and emotional intimacy or, to use
  common parlance, to find that sex brings them closer. Avoiding such
  intimacy demands an emotional distancing and mental compartmentalization
  - a cutting off of body from mind and from feeling - that not only
  undermines the self but dehumanizes the living, breathing, dreaming
  person beside you. As Jong herself put it, “The zipless fuck is…rarer
  than the unicorn. And I have never had one.”
  
  Perhaps the bottom line is that while women have the same right as men
  to act like sluts, this may not always be the right thing for either sex
  to do.

  Is stem cell science really anti-woman? Can anyone who truly believes in
  the right of women to be treated as rational citizens deserving of the
  same rights and opportunities as men campaign against the science on the
  grounds that women lack the capacity to give informed consent to egg
  donation?
  
  The answer to both questions is “no”.
  
  Yet these are precisely the claims made by Katrina George, the director
  of Women’s Forum Australia (WFA), in her piece last Thursday 2/11/06.
  
  George argued that because advances in stem cell research require
  women’s eggs, women would be pressured to act against their own
  self-interest and to donate them. Because egg donation is risky, and
  because women are - quite literally - incapable of saying “no” ,, the
  only solution to the potential for exploitation is to ban the technology
  all together.
  
  None of these claims withstand scrutiny.
  
  The aim of embryonic stem cell research is to gain knowledge about
  pluripotent cells, those capable of becoming any tissue in the body.
  Scientists are hopeful that such cells will help us develop treatments
  for currently incurable conditions like motor neuron disease,
  Alzheimer’s and the sorts of spinal cord injuries suffered by the late
  actor Christopher Reeves. Pluripotent cells may one day allow us to
  produce blood, and grow organs like hearts and livers that - because
  they are genetically matched to the patient - will eliminate the need
  for anti-rejection drugs.
  
  The crux of George’s claim is that this research cannot be done without
  eggs, and this means that women will be coerced into donating them. The
  solution she proposes is to ban the technologies in Australia, despite
  her knowledge that stem cell research will continue in places like the
  UK, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Finland and Spain.
  
  How will such coercion happen? In a submission opposing the passage of
  legislation designed to allow Australian scientists greater freedom to
  pursue stem cell cures, WFA said that if eggs are allowed to be sold,
  poor women will have no choice but to donate against their will.
  
  A valid claim, except for the fact that the legislation - to be debated
  in the Senate next week - explicitly prohibits the sale of eggs, sperms
  or embryos. Those guilty of inducing egg donation by offers of cash, a
  discount on treatment or even giving priority in the provision of
  service risk up to 10 years in jail.
  
  Women’s Forum Australia also claims that women will be coerced into
  donating by their desire to be seen as “good women”. Their submission
  says that “social and cultural expectations of feminine self-sacriifice”
  will lead women to “sacrifice their own interests, and assume the health
  risks of ova extraction for the sake of others”.
  
  In fact, women already donate eggs. In 2003 196 Victorian women gave
  their eggs to women they knew, although a small number donated to
  strangers.
  
  Is Women’s Forum Australia saying these women didn’t really choose to
  make such donations, but were simply trying to look like “good women” in
  the eyes of others? If such altruism should be banned when it comes to
  stem cell science, shouldn’t women be prohibited from donating eggs to
  women facing infertility, too?
  
  Women also donate blood, though this - like all medical procedures -
  carries risks. Should the state also step in here and say “no”?
  
  How would any of us feel to be told that we cannot donate an egg to a
  sister suffering infertility or to a stem cell research project
  attempting to cure a disease from which we, or a beloved child, suffers?
  
  The answer is infantilized, patronized, and mad as hell. If George
  thinks egg donation is too risky, she has the right to say “no”. What
  she doesn’t deserve is the freedom to stop me, or any other women,
  making my own risk/benefit calculation, and my own choice.
  
  Which takes us back to our first question: is stem cell science
  anti-woman? The clear answer is “no.” Researchers and scientists believe
  that as long as relevant legal rulings and ethical guidelines are
  followed, women have the same ability to give - or withhold - informed
  consent to being involved as men.
  
  Curiously, the sole source of sexism in the debate comes from groups
  asserting feminist credentials. Women’s Forum Australia describes itself
  as an “independent thinktank” that promotes “the advancement, well-being
  and freedom of all women”.
  
  The directors of WFA include the “bioethical advisor” to former pro-life
  Senator Brian Harradine, two women - including George - with links to
  Opus Dei and a Southern Cross Bioethics Institute (SCBI) staff member.
  SCBI is the research arm of Southern Cross Care, which is the product of
  the Knights of the Southern Cross, an order of Catholic men “committed
  to promoting the Christian way of life throughout Australia”.
  
  Defining “independent” is tricky, but there is little doubt that
  “thinktanks” should do good thinking.
  
  The factual sloppiness and offensively sexist nature of arguments
  advanced by George don’t fit the bill.

  WILL the carping of stem cell opponents never cease? First they insist
  their opposition to liberalisation of the laws governing embryo research
  is grounded in concern about women being exploited for their eggs. Then,
  one by one, they misrepresent and then reject every scientific
  alternative proposed to find alternative sources for such eggs.
  
  Senator Kay Patterson’s bill has already been stripped of its provision
  enabling scientists to create patient-matched stem cells using animal
  eggs (one solution to claimed concerns about increased pressure on women
  to donate). Now Monique Baldwin (“Pro-cloning activists shroud the
  truth”, Opinion, 28/11) wants to deprive scientists of other means of
  generating pluripotent stem cells - those able to generate any tissue in
  the body.
  
  Sure there is a “yuk factor” attached to the use of donated immature
  eggs from cadavers and female fetuses. But for most people, that is far
  preferable to Baldwin’s plan to cripple or kill Australian scientists’
  pursuit of stem cell cures.

  The death of a loved one is always difficult. For parents, regardless of
  the age of the child, anger, blame, impotence and guilt may accompany
  more generally experienced feelings like shock, disbelief, confusion,
  sadness, resentment, bitterness, hopelessness and depression.
  
  The essential task of a parent, alongside teaching and loving their
  children is protecting them. This may lead some parents to react to
  their child’s accidental or violent death with feelings of failure and
  guilt (“If only I’d…”). For many parents, a complete and unvarnished
  account of the cause of death, a full explanation of any mistakes made,
  and reassurance that systems have changed to avoid the recurrence of
  such problems is critical to the success of their healing journey.
  
  Judy Kovco’s public journey of grief and truth-seeking has laid bare the
  tragedy and as yet unresolved questions surrounding her son Jake’s death
  in Iraq in April. A claimed leak earlier this week of the military board
  of inquiry’s conclusion that Jake Kovco died of an unintentional
  self-inflicted gunshot wound may be one more example of the military’s
  mishandling of the incident and its aftermath.
  
  If this does turn out to be the board’s conclusion about how Jake Kovco
  died, it is not the one his mother wants to hear. From the moment last
  April when the Defence Minister wrongly informed the public that Kovco
  was shot in the head while cleaning his gun - a mishap followed in short
  order by the military’s mistaken repatriation of a Bosnian carpenter to
  Australia, and the loss in Melbourne airport of the draft report into
  this bungle - Judy has campaigned for the truth to be told about her
  son’s death. Commenting on the lost report she noted that it would not
  “bring my son back” or “tell…me what happened to my son. That’s what I
  want to know.”
  
  Judy Kovco’s approach and response to the military board of inquiry,
  however, point to some long-held suspicions. The separate counsel she
  and husband Martin engaged to represent them at the hearing made the
  point as far back as July this year that, “There are three people that
  had access to that firearm”. In response to police evidence at the
  inquiry that Jake’s lethal injury was self-inflicted, Judy is reported
  to have shouted “Keystone Kops!” before leaving the room. Not long
  after, she appeared on TV implying that bungled repatriation of Jake’s
  body was the consequence of a face-saving military cover-up. She said
  there was “no way known” that Jake would have shot himself purposely or
  accidentally, and that she would fight to obtain the truth for her son
  “forever”.
  
  In response to this week’s purported leak of the board’s forthcoming
  conclusions, Judy questioned the basis of any conclusion that Jake shot
  himself, and the trustworthiness of any investigation resulting in that
  conclusion. “This was the army investigating the army”, she said, adding
  that she has asked for a separate coronial inquiry. “I know what I have
  to do for Jake. I will fight for Jake and I will fight for the truth…I’m
  his mother and I will fight for him”.
  
  What are we to make of Judy Kovco’s pursuit of another investigation
  into the final moments of Private Jake Kovco?
  
  On the one hand, she seems to have formed a view early on in the piece -
  while still in the early stages of shock and grief - that someone other
  than Jake may have caused the gun to discharge. In September, months
  after retaining separate counsel that pursued this line of inquiry, she
  told a reporter that she was still in “complete shock” from the death.
  “I still haven’t come to grips with the fact that he’s gone”.
  
  Has Judy Kovco imagined the bogey-men with whom she must do battle in
  defence of her dead son, perhaps as a way of managing the terrible grief
  a parent experiences on the death of a beloved child? Is her desire to
  protect her son’s reputation from post-mortem slurs on his
  professionalism blinding her to the weight of evidence about what really
  happened?
  
  On the other hand, Judy Kovco is only pointing out what is undeniably
  true: that significant questions remain unanswered about the manner of
  Jake’s death, and the way the military managed and investigated it. They
  include queries about how the DNA of one of the soldiers with Kovco at
  the time wound up on Jake’s gun; why the military failed to seal the
  room after the incident, allowing Kovco’s clothes to be destroyed, and
  the clothes and bodies of the soldiers present to be washed (destroying
  potential forensic evidence); and the reason for the delayed military
  police interviews of Kovco’s two roommates and others in the unit,
  allowing the soldiers to get together and talk about the event. As the
  profile of the case grew, questions must also be asked about the wisdom
  of the military’s insistence on investigating itself, a decision that
  former justice George Hampel says inspires a “perception that they will
  look after their own”.
  
  Conspiracy or cock-up? Grief-blinded mother or whistle-blower? Without
  an independent investigation of the entire affair, we may never know.

  It turned out to be a storm in a teacup. In response to calls for a
  recount from a Victorian ALP confident the Democratic Labor Party’s
  number two man had cheated its own candidate of victory, the Victorian
  Electoral Commission (VEC) ran the figures again. On Thursday, the
  elevation of a third Green’s candidate to the Upper House was announced.
  
  Paul Austin (Opinion 14/12) derided those who feared a second DLP berth
  would unleash the same sort of horse-trading that Federal Family First
  Senator Steven Fielding has made an art form. But Austin is mistaken. It
  is true that the DLP would have been only one of 3 minor parties with
  whom Labor could have done deals to pass contested legislation in the
  upper house. However, the known reluctance of socially conservative
  Premier Steve Bracks to allow a vote to happen on the decriminalisation
  of abortion, and the implied willingness of the DLP to unquestioningly
  stand as one with the government if it shelved plans to bring the issue
  to a vote, made the party a real threat to progress on this and other
  women’s reproductive health issues. Indeed, it is possible that the
  elected DLP Member Peter Kavanagh retains the power to blackmail the
  government into steering clear of the abortion debate, given the
  necessity of his vote for the opposition parties to call the government
  to account through the inquiry and committee process.
  
  There are two conclusions to be drawn from the DLP seat that might have
  been. The first is that sadly, state party functionaries appear
  incapable of learning from the glacial mistakes of their Federal
  counterparts. Despite the election of Family First’s Steven Fielding to
  the Australian Senate in 2004 on preference deals (the party had just
  under 2% of the primary vote), Victorian party apparatchiks adopted
  similarly misguided tactics in their preferencing of the DLP. Hopefully,
  it won’t require an entire electoral cycle of monorail-minded horse
  trading of votes on key national issues in exchange for misogynist
  health policy and a bit of verbal gay-bashing, to prompt wiser choices
  next time around.
  
  Which brings me to the second point: the sobering fact that around 98
  per cent of Victorians in Federal elections, and 95 per cent in State
  ones, vote above the line. Such electors chose only the party that gets
  their primary vote. That party then decide - according to prevailing
  priorities, beliefs, relationships, threats and patronage promises - how
  their vote will be redistributed in the event its candidate fails to get
  over the line.
  
  The cynicism Australians feel about their political leaders makes this
  an odd choice. Why give those you neither trust nor respect critical
  control over who wields the reigns of power? On the other hand,
  reservoirs of contempt may have nowhere to flow but to seas of
  indifference. This is certainly the view of the experts who, in the
  absence of hard data, speculate that a strong desire for voting to be
  quick and painless motivates many to vote above the line. Above-the-line
  voting is quick, and reduces the stress surrounding additional
  decision-making beyond who we like best.
  
  However, laziness and indifference may not entirely explain our voting
  behaviour. Despite the newness of procedures surrounding the election of
  the upper house last month, approximately 3 per cent more Victorians
  voted below the line than had done in the 2004 Federal election. This
  may be because the new ballot paper makes below-the-line voting easier,
  requiring voters to rank just five candidates rather than the
  approximately 65 needing to be ordered when voting Federally.
  
  I also can’t help wondering whether voters equipped with better
  information about what their preferred party intends to do with their
  vote might be less inclined to hand over control. While the Victorian
  Electoral Act requires group voting tickets to be “prominently
  displayed” at polling booths, the VEC does little more than post
  preference deals on its website and signpost the manager’s possession of
  this information at voting centres. In the future, it might be hoped
  that the Bracks government’s laudatory march towards a state-of-the-art
  electoral system would see electronic voting offered to all Victorians,
  not just the vision-impaired. I fantasise about a computer interface
  that would respond to an above-the-line vote above the line with an
  information screen explaining the nature of this choice, the preference
  arrangements of the party selected, and a “complete your vote” and
  “change your vote” option.
  
  It is unfair to attribute the Family First fiasco and DLP debacle to the
  single transferable vote and the proportionality it introduces into the
  Australian political system. Proportional representation is widely
  acknowledged to introduce valuable elements of sharing, disbursing and
  limiting power into a democracy that concentrates significant power in
  the hands of the majority. Instead, it may be the refusal of the
  overwhelming majority of Australian electors to take control of the
  entire life course of their vote that results in the elevation of
  candidates that few choose - in a meaningfully informed fashion - to
  govern us.

  TEASE: Once upon a time, there were two men.
  
  TEASE: The first, Gary, had a child in a shaky marriage. The couple
  separated, but then reconciled. When Patti discovered she was pregnant,
  both knew the child could be that of the lover she took during their
  time apart. Patti agreed to put Gary’s name on the birth certificate,
  and Gary pledged to love and raise the child - Gary Jr - as his own. But
  when the marriage ended, Patti asked the court to deny Gary further
  access to the boy on the grounds that he was not the child’s biological
  father. Gary fought back, seeking to maintain contact and both rights
  and obligations to the child. Ultimately, however, the court held that
  as “third parties” neither he - nor his parents - had any entitlement to
  a relationship with the small child.
  
  The second man, Liam, was married for four years. After separating from
  his wife he sporadically paid child support for his three children.
  Several years later Liam took a paternity test that showed his eldest
  child was the only one biologically related to him, enabling much of his
  debt for unpaid child support for all three children - none of whom
  speak to him any longer - to be cancelled. Still not content, Liam
  launches a suit against his ex-wife for damages caused by her “deceit”,
  including financial losses related “to the time he had spent with, and
  money he had spent on, the children under the mistaken belief that he
  was their father.”
  
  My response to these stories includes feelings of pity and of admiration
  for Gary, and of moral revulsion for Liam (not to mention Patti). Yet
  while Gary languishes in obscurity, Liam has become the poster-child for
  parts of the Father’s Rights Movement: the man who story is intended to
  alchemise our pity and moral outrage into table-thumping demands for
  systemic change to the family law system.
  
  However, if the media’s coverage of the two cases is anything to go by,
  I may be alone in moral assessment of both men’s actions. While Gary’s
  case has been virtually ignored by the, every step of Liam’s journey
  through the courts has been catalogued by a panoply of mostly male
  journalists whose indignant hearts appear to beat as one with his.
  Regularly referred to as a “cuckold”, and the children he has parented
  from birth as those “fathered” by “his wife’s lover”, such hacks appear
  unable to resist photographing Liam in tragic poses: head bowed and hand
  slapped across face, or looking wistfully into the distance at what
  might have been.
  
  What might have been? An alternative - and morally balanced universe -
  would have told a different story about Gary and Liam. Gary’s story
  might have provided growing evidence of men’s recognition of the
  critical role they do and should play in the lives of children; not as
  sperm donors or walking wallets, but committed hands-on parents. The
  rallying of Father’s Rights Groups behind Gary would have reinforced the
  message from such groups that fathers matter in the lives of children,
  and that the role of law and policy is to assist married men to actively
  parent their children and to maintain their relationship with them in
  the unhappy event of relationship breakdown.
  
  In contrast, the media and Father’s Rights Activists in this alternative
  universe would largely ignore Liam’s case. Such groups, strengthened by
  the inclusion in their ranks of adoptive fathers and men parenting
  children born from donor insemination, would be appalled by the cost of
  Liam’s legal manoeuvrings to the children who call him “dad”. Joining
  with the Child Support Agency to urge that parents in such situations to
  “think about the impacts on their children”, both groups would judge
  Liam harshly for elevating his desire for retributive justice against
  his ex-wife above the viability of his paternal relationship with his
  children. To avoid such cases in the future, they would call for
  Australian law to consistently define fatherhood in social, rather than
  biological, terms.
  
  The closest thing to love is hate, and marriage can be a dirty game.
  Infidelity in relationships where faithfulness is expected or agreed to
  is wrong, no matter who does the deed (though statistics remind us that
  men - not women - are most often the culprits)) But how much tarring and
  feathering should innocent dependants be asked to wear to assuage the
  pride or deepen the hip pocket of either party?
  
  In my alternative moral universe every person dignified with the title
  “adult” would know when enough is enough.

  Do blogs spell the end of moderated opinion? As expected, internet
  enthusiasts say “yes”. The destiny of the World Wide Web is to end
  hierarchical, corporate control over the content and dissemination of
  knowledge, and the glorious reality - as far as editorial and analysis
  is concerned - is nothing less than the liberation of the opinionated
  from the oppressive control of toady, petty and uncomprehending editors.
  
  Some Australian editors, not to mention relatively savvy members of the
  intelligentsia, appear to have bought the “end is nigh” story, much as
  they did the reports - greatly exaggerated it turned out - of the death
  of print news from the internet (and before that television) and the
  death of radio from podcasting.
  
  The reality is that the net is the medium, not the message. Yes, the
  World Wide Web enables opinion and analysis to be distributed to
  consumers in different ways. However, insofar as there really is an
  audience wanting to consume informed opinion and analysis, there is no
  logical reason to suppose changes in the way such content can be
  disseminated should impact in absolute terms - either negatively or
  positively - on demand for the content.
  
  Can personal blogs (web diaries or logs) posted free-of-charge on the
  web meet this demand? Are they doing so already, increasingly
  cannibalising audiences which currently consume - and pay for either by
  subscription or by viewing ads - editor-moderated opinion and analysis
  on radio, TV, newspapers and news magazines distributed both in hard
  copy and on line (enabling links and interactive reader comments)?
  
  With one important caveat, my judgement on both questions is “no”. When
  they do their job well, editors provide a valuable service to time-poor
  readers struggling to remain informed citizens in an information-dense
  world. Valuable enough, that they will continue to seek it out and,
  where necessary, pay for it. That service is the sorting and selecting
  of opinion and analysis on the basis of priority (the top stories of the
  day), “mix” (diversity of subject) and quality (the best-written stories
  by the people most likely to know something about the issue). It also
  includes packaging the product so it is visually appealing and - because
  paragraphs are plentiful, words are spelled properly and sentences are
  grammatical - easy to read.
  
  Personal blogs can be well written and provide considered and informed
  opinion by those with the experience and knowledge to offer consumers
  considerable insight into the subject to hand. However, once we get past
  the giddiness of the gateless access available to both writers and
  readers, we may be able to be honest enough to admit that some are
  semi-literate rants by myopic, racist, sexist and and/or homophobic
  cretins with tickets on themselves and barrows to push. At least these
  are easy to spot. The blogs I worry about are those lacking the “danger
  Will Robinson” alert signs: written in spare and polished prose, posted
  on expensive well-designed sites yet evidencing what can only be
  described as a tenuous grasp of logic and a hostile relationship with
  the facts.
  
  Of course, individuals with time to burn can do their own vetting of
  blogs on topics where they have enough expertise to know when someone
  else is out of their depth (My education and experience allows me to
  spot a pseudo-feminist or a quack ethicist at 20 paces). However, like
  most others, I am defenceless in the face of well-written views on
  topics about which I am curious but largely uninformed. Editorial
  oversight is one of the processes that prevents the publication of
  well-packaged pseudo-knowledge - much of the time, anyway.
  
  Which, amidst the now deafening howls of protest, takes me to the
  caveat. Yes, vetting by editors is one process for guaranteeing us that
  some degree of veracity attaches to the content we are spending our
  hard-earned time consuming, but it is not the only one. For proof of
  this, we need look no further than the collective and demonstrably
  reliable editing process used to moderate contributions to online
  encyclopaedia. My claim is about the ongoing value in today’s world, and
  worlds to come, of moderated opinion and analysis, even in a
  cyber-universe where personal blogs are ubiquitous and priced to sell.
  Currently, traditional editorial practices are one of the only ways
  we’ve got to achieve reasonable levels of accuracy, veracity, and good
  clean copy. In the future, equally reliable ways may, and indeed are
  predicted, to emerge. Those that will be preferred by future consumers
  of analysis and opinion is anyone’s guess.
  
  But here is mine.
  
  What contemporary blogophiles advance as the benefit of their preferred
  medium is the weakness of opinion moderated by a handful of mostly pale,
  male and stale editors. Blogs empower those marginalised or excluded by
  traditional editorial gate-keeping processes. These include the young,
  the female, the queer, the non-White and those from non-Christian
  backgrounds: groups comprising growing minorities - and in some cases
  outright majorities - in Australian society
  
  In the past, justice was the justificatory principle behind demands by
  such groups for greater representation in the creative engine room of
  Australian culture, including among those who interpret the news. In the
  era of blogs, it may be proprietorial self-interest that finally sees
  things change.

  Do blogs spell the end of moderated opinion? Internet enthusiasts say
  “yes”. For them, the World Wide Web’s destiny is to end hierarchical,
  corporate control over the content and dissemination of knowledge by
  liberating the opinionated from the oppressive control of toady, petty
  and uncomprehending editors.
  
  I disagree. Personal blogs are not a substitute for forums providing
  informed opinion and analysis. When they do their job well, editors
  provide a service of great value to time-poor citizens struggling to
  manage an information-rich environment. This service includes sorting,
  selecting and commissioning to ensure readers get the best people
  talking about a good mix of the most important issues of the day.
  
  Some personal blogs are well written and their authors well-informed.
  But if we are honest, we would acknowledge that some are semi- literate
  rants by myopic cretins with tickets on themselves and serious anger
  management issues.
  
  Moderating opinion is one way to guarantee citizens some degree of
  veracity attaches to the content we consume.

    headline: The state-sanctioned bullying of fat kids
    link: http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php?/site/article/5530/
    publication: 'Spiked - London,UK'
content: |-
  Fat camps, prohibitions on junk food advertising, bans on sugary drinks
  in school canteens, Medicare subsidies for private weight loss programs,
  chair-free classrooms, food pyramids. Bariatric surgery, school
  weigh-ins, public service announcements telling kids to take more
  exercise, public hospital weight management clinics for the young.
  Bulging childhood waistlines as risk factors for diabetes, heart
  disease, escalating health care costs and social exclusion. Childhood
  obesity as lifestyle choice, disease, biological destiny or the result
  of parental ignorance, sloth or permissiveness. And in 2006, a
  three-fold increase in the number of Melbourne children - some as young
  as 10 - admitted to hospital with eating disorders resulting from their
  morbid fear of fat.
  
  And of winding up unloveable and unloved?
  
  Surely, I am not the only person who has noticed that not only has our
  current approach to the “youth obesity epidemic” been ineffective in
  reducing our children’s collective girth, but also violates the
  first-order principle of medical ethics that above all, we must do no
  harm.
  
  How does calling our kids tubby harm them? These days everyone knows
  that “fat” is more than a physical description of body mass, but a
  negative assessment of physical attractiveness and moral worth. Despite
  protests outside the White House by overweight Americans holding
  placards insisting that “fat is not a four letter word”, children today
  are well aware of the connection in the popular mind between the
  generously waisted and the indiscreet, the lazy, the pitiful, the
  asexual and the wildly out of control. Cultural researchers say it is no
  coincidence that in times of sexual permissiveness and consumerist
  plenty, thinness is idealized for representing virtue, self-denial and
  self-control.
  
  Children’s bodies change rapidly right up to their early twenties, with
  the pre-teen and teen years critical moments for the development of
  self-identity and self-esteem. It’s hard to imagine a worse time for
  children to be told their developing bodies are an eyesore and evidence
  of poor moral character.
  
  Just as damning is the inevitable failure of any behavioural change
  approach obsessed with cataloguing and stamping out fat. Behavioural
  change relies on our feeling good about ourselves, something just as
  true for children as for adults. The higher the temperature surrounding
  the moral panic about our children’s expanding girth, the worse
  overweight children are likely to feel about themselves, and the less
  likely they are to feel worthy of their own efforts to change.
  
  This counterproductive behavioural circularity that begins with low
  self-esteem is familiar to addiction counsellors, and is no less evident
  - should we care to listen - in the testimony of the overweight. “You
  get in a vicious circle about losing weight,” Diane O’Mara told the Age
  earlier this year. “You eat the wrong thing, then you feel bad, then you
  eat more.” The nexus between harsh social judgments of the obese, their
  low self-esteem and consequent inability to lose weight is summed up by
  American professor and author Peter Stearns. “If you fail to lose weight
  you are demonstrating you’re a bad person. It’s a big burden. Faced with
  this additional pressure you are even more likely to say \`The hell with
  it! I’m going to get ice cream. I am such a bad person I need to solace
  myself.’”
  
  Of course, the poor correlation between negative self esteem and
  successful weight loss serves the diet industry well. Studies suggest
  that only when consumers hate their overweight bodies, and believe them
  unattractive, are they motivated to dig deep for the diet products and
  services worth more than 500 million a year in Australia. As well, the
  now accepted paradox that dieting makes you fat ensures that the vast
  majority of consumers will “fail” and - dragging their bedraggled
  self-esteem behind them - return for second and third helpings of
  expensive but ineffective “therapy”.
  
  But if insults are counter-productive and hand wringing is out, what
  should we be doing? In general terms, we need to stop talking about the
  depravity of fat, and focus instead on the desirability of good health.
  Focusing on obesity inevitably leads to “don’t” and “shouldn’t” messages
  that problematically posit guilt and counterproductively idealise
  penitent self-denial. In contrast, promoting good health lends itself to
  messages of “do” (eat healthy foods) and “desert” (as in, you deserve
  it) that connect self-nurture with the bodily well-being necessary to
  enjoy the good things in life.
  
  Positive messages are also more likely to be effective in promoting
  behavioural change, and insofar as they focus more on the importance of
  staying active rather than on what we eat, may even be more consistent
  with the medical evidence. Paul Campos, Professor of law at the
  University of Colorado and author of The Obesity Myth argues that
  activity is a better predictor of health than weight and that “There is
  no good evidence that significant long-term weight loss is beneficial to
  health”.
  
  We need to speak to our children, and about them, in ways that make our
  love for them, and approval of the people they are becoming, crystal
  clear. Teaching them how to nurture themselves by eating healthy food
  and participating in physical activity they enjoy is the most ethical
  and effective way for us as parents, and as a society, to offer them the
  gift of good health.

  It goes something like this: failing to lose weight proves you’re a bad
  person, which leads you to need that chocolate bar to comfort yourself
  for being so bad.
  
  So, no more preaching about the depravity of fat. Instead, let’s teach
  our children how to nurture themselves by eating and behaving in ways
  that lead to good health.

  Privacy, as Victorian Privacy Commissioner Paul Chadwick recently
  observed, is a freedom most noticed in its absence. Sadly, we only seem
  to appreciate what we had once it’s gone.
  
  Philosophers, having long accepted the inadequacy of words to explain
  the importance of privacy, often illustrate it with 18th century thinker
  Jeremy Bentham’s panopticon.
  
  The panopticon is a circular building divided into cells constructed
  around a central tower. While occupants are isolated from one another by
  walls, they can be viewed by an unseen observer.
  
  A prison? Absolutely, but more than this the building was designed to
  obtain “power of mind over mind by creating a”sentiment of an invisible
  omniscience", or what you and I might describe as the unnerving
  uncertainty that someone could be watching you.
  
  The value of privacy is only grasped when we recognize that even if the
  surveyors do nothing with the information they gather about cell
  occupants - neither recording nor relaying it - it is their power to
  observe us if and when they choose that causes harm.
  
  The Federal Government announced last April its intention to pursue what
  is in all but name a national identity card. The scheme has the capacity
  to compromise our privacy in relationship to government, and the
  mega-corporations (among them Unisys, Visa and IBM) expected to vie for
  the lucrative privilege of providing the technology to merge, match and
  share our personal information across the public and private sectors.
  
  Current proposals suggest my card will contain my unique identifying
  number and name on the front, as well as my signature and biometric
  photo. The smart chip will contain - among other things - my address, my
  date of birth and details of my children and other dependants. These
  details are mandatory, must reside in the “public” zone of the card, and
  are protected by a PIN so insecure that the Australian Privacy
  Foundation has condemned the card’s technological design as “completely
  inadequate”. In other words, according to the parts of the legislation
  the government has made public, anyone with a card reader will be able
  to see the private details stored on my card’s chip.
  
  This includes hundreds of thousands of government employees, health and
  allied professions and childcare workers. Last year Centrelink revealed
  it had to sack, sanction or turn over to the police or government
  prosecutors 2% of their staff for breaches of “customer” privacy.
  
  Some people object to identity cards on principle. They, like Liberal
  party official Tim Warner, believe that by forcing us to prove our
  identity to obtain government services, ID cards invert the master
  servant relationship of citizen and government. Governments only confirm
  such fears when they contend that those with nothing to hide have
  nothing to fear.
  
  I agree with such principles, but my objection to the card is more
  practical.
  
  I advocate for reproductive rights. Each year I spend time and money
  protecting my phone number (it’s silent), my address (not on the
  electoral rolls), and the names, ages and other identifying details of
  my children. I do this because a handful of my opponents are violent, as
  the murder of a security guard at the East Melbourne Fertility Clinic in
  2001 proved. As far as possible, I try to protect my family from the
  negative repercussions of my activism.
  
  Minister for Human Services Joe Hockey says that when it comes to the
  card, Australians have choice. We don’t have to have the card at all. As
  well, he says that the card mandates the same information found on a
  driver’s license. If the system is cracked - something he has repeatedly
  refused to guarantee won’t happen - citizens lose no more than they do
  when their wallets go missing.
  
  First, it is disingenuous to say that participation in the new identity
  card system is voluntary. No card means no Medicare rebates, PBS
  medicines, Centrelink payments, Veteran’s pensions, disability benefits,
  carers’ payments, baby bonus, AusStudy, unemployment benefits or related
  concessions on public transport and utility bills. Unless we are
  independently wealthy, we will need to sign up.
  
  The wallet story also mischaracterizes reality. I lose mine with
  absent-minded-professorial regularity and usually, someone nice returns
  it to me intact.
  
  When they don’t, or its been deliberately nabbed, the loss of my silent
  number or information about my children has never been a concern. This
  is not only because, like most people, I don’t keep this information in
  my wallet, but because even if I did, it would be unlikely to be of
  interest to an opportunistic thief: something that can’t be said about
  the high-tech robbers expected to attempt to break in to the honeypot of
  identity card data.
  
  Like much that is lost, neither the privacy of my silent number or
  address can be found again. Like a victim of domestic violence, at
  similar risk to having their safety jeopardized by exposure of their
  address details, getting a new number and shifting house are the only
  way to regain my security. At least it’s something. The privacy of my
  children’s details is gone forever.
  
  All of us are at risk of such irrecoverable loss of our private
  identifying details and - because the database will hold our biometric
  data and copies of our proof of identity documents like passports and
  birth certificates - identity theft. No matter how state of the art the
  security designed to protect it, the very nature of the IT wars - the
  battle for supremacy between security geeks and crackers - means
  security risks to the system will be perpetual and very real. Steal my
  credit card, I cancel it and get another. But what next when a
  cyber-crim knocks off the biometric parameters of my face?
  
  Current proposals for an Australian identity card put my security and
  that of my family at risk. However, one should not need to demonstrate
  such a threat to claim the right to enjoy the benefits of privacy. The
  balance is all wrong. The question isn’t whether citizens have something
  to hide. The question is whether the government is entitled to demand,
  record, sift, sort, match and share our private information and
  biometric identifiers without making a solid case for why this is
  necessary, how it will work, and why less invasive approaches won’t do.
  
  The kick-off date for card issuing is April or May 2008. Time is fast
  running out for Australians to say “no”.

  The hypocrisy of the Coalition government on issues of personal choice
  is breathtaking. While supporters of restrictions on junk food
  advertising to children or universal minimum workplace conditions are
  “nanny state” advocates, blanket prohibitions on the capacity of
  terminally ill Australians to control the time and manner of their own
  deaths are claimed to show adequate respect for individual choice.
  
  International and Australian surveys repeatedly show strong public
  support for euthanasia. A 2002 Morgan survey found 70% in favour of laws
  allowing hopelessly ill patients to seek assistance from doctors to
  suicide. Seventy-five per cent of sitting members in the last Victorian
  parliament supported the rights of the terminally ill to die with
  dignity.
  
  Such figures may explain why opponents of a right-to-die rarely mention
  the religious and ideological principles behind their stand and focus
  instead on pragmatic objections to legal change. These include claims
  that patient-controlled death will undercut efforts to improve
  palliative care, that proper pain management always alleviates
  suffering, and that only what Juliette Hughes (Opinion 30/1) calls “the
  desperate, lonely, depressed and in pain” (ie those lacking autonomy)
  choose death over palliation.
  
  Oregon, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland allow medicos to
  respond to patient requests for active assistance to die. Empirical
  evidence from these jurisdictions does not support claims that the
  legalisation of assisted suicide for the terminally ill undercuts the
  quality of palliative care. This makes sense, as only around 2% of
  terminally ill patients make use of their legal right to assisted
  suicide. The remainder continue to choose palliative care.
  
  A phenomenal 77% of Australians disbelieve the repeated insistence of
  right to die opponents that modern palliative care sufficiently
  addresses the suffering of the terminally ill. The decision of John
  Elliot - a medical doctor - to suicide in Zurich last Thursday suggests
  he didn’t believe it either. Or, alternatively, that he understood that
  suffering is not limited to physical pain but includes the loss of one’s
  wits, privacy with regard to bodily functions and the capacity to
  present oneself to others - including one’s spouse and children - as one
  would like to be seen. Anticipation of uncontrolled pain as well as the
  loss of such personal dignity appears a major motivator of Elliot’s
  decision to die: “My disease has dictated that…I will die in pain. Worse
  than this, though, I will have no dignity in death. I don’t want my wife
  Angelika to see me in this way…. I want to exit this world…with my head
  held high.”
  
  At the heart of the right-to-die case are claims about the entitlement
  of citizens to autonomously choose to live what they define as a good
  life, and die what they see as a good death. But Liberal democratic
  societies have no obligation to honour the wishes of the incompetent or
  the coerced. This is why those opposed to the legal right to die use
  language - “knocked off” or “put to death” - that assumes what must be
  proved: that those other than the terminally ill will dictate the ifs
  and whens of an assisted suicide.
  
  Circular definitions help “prove” their case. For right-to-die
  opponents, only the depressed choose death over palliation, and
  depressed patients can’t make autonomous choices. Similarly, it is
  claimed that patients who are loved and adequately cared for will not
  choose to die, rendering all who do make this choice necessary victims
  of coercion by penny-pinching medical administrators or avaricious
  relatives.
  
  Dr Elliot was wealthy, educated, not depressed, and consistent about his
  desire to die. But his life was not perfect. His wife was open about the
  burdensome nature of his care. In his recitation of his reasons for
  choosing death Elliot includes the fact that he had burdened her for
  “too long already”.
  
  Do decisions to die that reference the needs or influence of important
  others, or society at large, lack the independence necessary for us to
  heed them? Those opposed to individual choice in personal moral matters
  say “yes”. Abortion opponents argue that an “abortion culture” pushes
  women to undertake “unwanted” abortions. Men who fail to offer women the
  financial or emotional support they want to continue the pregnancy
  “coerce” women into abortion in the same way as inadequately sacrificing
  relatives compel the terminally ill to “choose” death.
  
  The truth is that if choices were only available to those with perfect
  lives, few of us would quality. It is one thing to point out that social
  conditions may constrain the freedom of individuals to choose by
  depriving them of the full range of options, or the capacity to choose
  between them. It’s another to say that less than ideal choice is no
  choice at all. As well, arguments that the addition of
  physician-assisted suicide to the range of options available to the
  terminally ill somehow reduces their freedom to choose make no sense at
  all.
  
  We’ve been here before. Thirty years ago radical feminists insisted that
  a pro-natalist culture and coercion from “techno-docs” made the choices
  of infertile women to undertake IVF unworthy of the name. These
  feminists claimed that the incapacity of “vulnerable” infertile women to
  choose, plus the damage they claimed the technology posed to women as a
  group, justified banning it.
  
  Resentful of being patronised, many infertile women returned fire.
  
  Choices made in an imperfect world are still worthy of respect, they
  insisted. By all means, fix the world to expand our options further. But
  in the meantime, leave us with the freedom to decide between the options
  that are available, according to our needs and values.

  I marched on the streets of Melbourne to express my opposition to the
  war and Australia’s involvement in it. From the trumped-up and
  ultimately fictitious casus belli, the predicted unpreparedness of the
  invading forces to win the peace and the incompetent and corrupt
  reconstruction process, the war’s prosecution has fulfilled - indeed
  exceeded - every gloom-and-doom prediction of the nay-sayers.
  
  Being able to acknowledge mistakes is a sign of good character and a
  necessity for decision-makers charged with the making of policy into the
  future. Yet it is hard to quibble with the assessment of New York Times
  columnist Paul Krugman that the Bush Administration has an
  “infallibility complex” and a “Captain Queeg-like inability” to own up
  its own leadership failures in Iraq.
  
  Yet, despite my belief we should never have gone to war, and my
  agreement that a fulsome apology for past errors from the war’s leaders
  is long overdue, I am not convinced that withdrawing our troops - now or
  according to a pre-set timeline - is the right thing to do. Anti-war
  politicians and commentators suggest that the failure of the Coalition
  of the Willing to avoid the war in the first place and to prosecute it
  competently and honestly once involved, provides ground for us withdraw
  from Iraq, immediately or in the near future. But I think the opposite
  may be true: that it is precisely because the Coalition has made such a
  mess in Iraq that we may be obliged to stay.
  
  The thinking behind this conclusion is not revolutionary. Say the fire
  brigade arrives at your house and despite a complete lack of evidence of
  any fire, sprays water everywhere, causing serious damage to building
  and furnishings. You would expect the brigade to accept responsibility
  for doing whatever you nominated as necessary to put things to right
  (drag carpets into the sun, pay to replace the sofa). You would expect
  this even if the entire mess had been caused by their mistakenly coming
  to your door rather than the burning house down the street, or the lack
  of wisdom or experience that saw them let loose despite not seeing any
  flames. Columnist Thomas Friedman calls this the pottery store rule of
  causal obligation: you break it, you own it.
  
  Iraq Body Count estimates that a minimum of 56,102 Iraqi civilians has
  been killed by the war in Iraq. According to press reports, child
  malnutrition has doubled since the invasion, reaching levels in poor
  African countries. Bagdad residents suffer 70% unemployment, receive
  less than 6 hours a day of electricity and mostly live with sewage and
  without potable water. Precipitous declines in household incomes since
  the war mean that half the country’s people now live below the poverty
  line.
  
  Today’s Iraq is indeed broken, and good arguments can be made that this
  is in substantial part a consequence of the war and the Coalition’s
  failings when it came to the hard work of “winning the peace”.
  
  Despite this, it is the rare politician who takes account of our
  obligations to the Iraqis for the mess we’ve made in propounding their
  proposed solution to the crisis. Instead, the case for surging,
  super-surging, downscaling or withdrawing is largely made with reference
  to the demands of protecting US prestige, fostering national or world
  security or avoiding further troop losses. Many commentators, well aware
  of appalling moral breaches in the conduct of the war (ranging from the
  ritual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison to the
  construction by contractors with strong links to the Bush administration
  of key building projects that leak human sewage through the walls) have
  adopted a similarly self-referential line.
  
  None of this is to say that American and Australian politicians and
  commentators - not to mention the American and Australian peoples -
  should not be concerned with the well-being of our troops, and the
  security of our nations. We have obligations in this regard, too.
  Rather, it is simply to note that it is unseemly to debate our future
  involvement in conflict-ridden Iraq without reference to
  responsibilities generated by our past decisions and their negative
  consequences for Iraq’s civilian population.
  
  How best to fulfil these obligations? Some might say a Coalition
  withdrawal is the only way. The Bush administration has been so corrupt
  and incompetent in its prosecution of the war and peace that the best
  response to the resulting plight of Iraqis is to clear out of the way.
  Alternatively, it could be argued that the only way for the US and
  Australia to get it right in Iraq is to commit to doing whatever it
  takes for as long as it takes to at least leave things - income levels,
  child health, sanitation and security - as we found them (sans the
  dictator of course, which could be our way of saying “sorry” for all the
  intervening inconvenience and suffering).
  
  It is this sort of debate that I think we should be having. One about
  precisely what strategies will best enable us to meet our obligations to
  our troops, ourselves and the civilians of Iraq. But first, we need to
  get the moral foundations right.

  It is important we don’t miss the forest for the trees. As the Michael
  Neal scandal rolls on, with the Health Minister Bronwyn Pike now
  admitting that the health department “bungled” the case, we need to
  consider whether the “better protocols” being mooted as the answer for
  protecting public health in the future are really the answer. Or does
  officialdom need to dig deeper to discover why transmission rates of HIV
  in Victoria are high and rising.
  
  I think we need to dig deeper. Down, in fact, to the central moral
  claims of the safe sex message at the heart of public health campaigns
  to reduce transmission of HIV/AIDS.
  
  Debates about the moral adequacy of the safe sex message have been going
  on in the HIV Positive community for years. On one side are those who
  support public health messages focused solely on the responsibility
  individuals have to protect themselves from infection. From campaigns
  that cajole men to not be a fool and “cover their tool”, to the “cover
  yourself against AIDS” and “love is not enough” messages, the existing
  educational focus emphasizes the need for people who wish to avoid
  infection to watch their own backs. Commented the CEO of the Victorian
  AIDS Council on the Neal case: “Without wishing to sound like the last
  of the rugged individualists, people do need to take the responsibility
  to protect themselves”.
  
  Of course the flip side of the “it’s all down to you” approach is that
  when unsafe consensual sex does result in transmission, it is the newly
  infected partner who wears the blame. This is particularly the case. it
  appears, if the reason the HIV-negative person had unprotected sex
  because they trusted that a positive partner would either disclose his
  status or simply refuse to proceed without a condom. “We’re trying to
  work on educating people not to make those mistakes and assumptions that
  stuff up their lives”, the convener of the National Association of
  People Living with HIV/AIDS said recently.
  
  On the other side of the debate are those like the former convener of
  Positive Women Philomena Horsley who reject the blame-the-victim feel of
  this hyper-individualist approach to public health. They contend that
  while there may be good reason to design public health messages to
  trigger the natural inclination of most to look out for number one, the
  moral inadequacy of this approach - and it’s lack of cohesion with the
  moral expectations of many - demands an urgent revamp. They note that
  not only do some gay men assume their sexual partner will do the right
  thing by them, this propensity to trust others not to do the dirty on
  them is not just a normal and good thing, it is largely justified.
  According to a recent report by the Australian Research Centre for Sex,
  Health and Society, the vast majority of HIV positive men in Australia
  do disclose their status to sexual partners at the beginning of a
  relationship or the moment they discover it themselves, while the
  majority wear condoms in casual encounters with partners whose HIV
  status they either do not know or know to be negative.
  
  In other words, despite consistent communications to the sexually active
  of all varieties that the only obligations we have are to ourselves,
  those infected by the virus - and at risk of infection - expect more
  than this, both from ourselves and from others. We expect that as human
  beings we have obligations not to harm our fellows, and that having HIV
  or being at risk of it doesn’t ameliorate this responsibility one jot.
  
  Nor should it. It is not “ruggedly individualistic” but rather morally
  offensive for public health messages to imply that we have no
  responsibilities to other human beings, and that we are chumps when we
  expect others to recognize and honor their obligations to us. Not just
  offensive, but out of touch with the everyday sexual morality practiced
  by many, and dismissive of the needs and circumstances of particular
  at-risk communities.
  
  Most notable of these is the small but sadly growing community of
  positive women. Women commonly contract HIV from their spouses or steady
  boyfriends, men who these women trust are not just faithful but
  straight. Public health messages that imply that these women had no one
  to blame but themselves for infection because they didn’t insist that
  “if it wasn’t on, it wasn’t on” overlook the culpability these men bear
  for failing to disclose their risk factors or to insist that a condom be
  worn every time.
  
  What is the answer? I’d like to see a “Safe Sex Plus” approach to
  reducing infection rates. Men and women should continue to be told that
  the best way of protecting themselves from infection is to ensure
  condoms are part of each sexual encounter, but they must also be
  reminded of their obligation to do the right thing by others.
  
  If individuals know they are or might be positive, they have an
  obligation to protect their sexual partner by either disclosing what
  they know - or don’t know - about their HIV status, or simply insisting
  on a condom every time. And if infection does occur, it is not those who
  trusted in others not to harm them who deserve blame, but those who
  didn’t do all that they could to avoid doing the harming.

  The removal of the Federal Health Minister’s veto over RU486 last
  February was hailed as a victory for women, and a portent of what could
  be accomplished if politicians and grass roots activists worked together
  across party lines. In the wake of the conscience vote, female
  politicians suggested the victory was a taste of things to come. In the
  future, they would join hands to deliver women things like paid
  maternity leave, accessible and affordable childcare and a more
  equitable tax system for families where both parents worked.
  
  Better protection from deceptive and misleading advertising was not on
  the list.
  
  But it should have been. While Australia has an extensive web of
  consumer protection regulations, there are loopholes. The most
  significant is that only services that charge a fee are prohibited from
  engaging in deceptive and misleading advertising. Those that offer free
  services can advertise them in any way they please in the phone book, on
  the web, in magazines and on posters placed in doctor’s offices and
  politics stations.
  
  Australian women are hit hardest by this gap in legal protection, in
  particular, women facing an unplanned pregnancy. This is because they
  are the targets of ads for “counseling” by agencies that don’t provide
  balanced and accurate information about abortion and won’t refer women
  for an abortion, or even to a service that they believe will.
  
  Let’s be clear. The problem here is not that agencies exist that won’t
  refer for termination. The problem is that such agencies don’t clearly
  state that this is their policy in their ads.
  
  The push to put an end to such deception began last year with a private
  member’s bill introduced by Natasha Stott Despoja. The compelling and
  commonsense nature of the case against false advertising saw her joined
  earlier this year by Senators from most of the major parties to
  co-sponsor a simplified version of the Bill: Liberal Judith Troeth,
  Labor’s Carol Brown and Greens’ Kerry Nettle.
  
  Labor had promised to support the Pregnancy Counselling (Truth in
  Advertising) Bill, which was introduced into Federal Parliament early
  this year. Because the Greens and Democrats were already on board, its
  backing would have meant that with only a few Liberals would have had to
  cross the floor - and the numbers were there - to make it law.
  
  But last month the Labor leadership balked. When opponents of
  transparent advertising voiced their disapproval in the party room the
  vote was “deferred”. Oh, to be a fly on the wall at that caucus meeting.
  I mean, what exactly do those opposed to truth in advertising, in all
  instances or just when it applies to pregnant women, say in support of
  their case? Deceptive means are OK when we think the ends - a claimed
  reduction in the abortion rate - are so good? Or do they instead, as
  media coverage of the Labor’s leadership blink suggested was the case,
  simply spread disinformation about what the Bill says, and what it will
  do?
  
  The truth is that the Bill is so short and simple that no
  Legalese-to-English dictionary is needed. It requires only that all
  pregnancy counselling agencies include in their advertisements a
  statement like “this service does/does not provide referrals for
  termination of pregnancy”. It does not require that any agency refer for
  abortion, and sanctions only agencies that persist in advertising
  themselves in deceptive and misleading ways.
  
  The issue was ignored at last weekend’s Labor party conference and with
  the budget set to dominate the next session of Federal Parliament,
  followed by the election, some now say the Bill has little chance of
  becoming law.
  
  Yet the situation remains urgent. Today, the Federal government launched
  its “pregnancy support” telephone line as part of its $51 million dollar
  suite of interventions to reduce what the Federal Health Minister Tony
  Abbott calls the “national disgrace” of Australia’s abortion rate. The
  “Helpline” continues to inspire concern amongst Federal women Senators.
  Senator Stott Despoja, for instance, has recently worried that the
  telephone line would not provide relevant or specific information or
  helpful referrals. Because it will be a free service, anxiety about the
  truthfulness of the ads run to notify the public of its existence are
  also a concern.
  
  A new campaign, jointly sponsored by GetUp and Reproductive Choice
  Australia, will urge Australians to support the passage of the
  cross-party truth in advertising Bill. Last year 20,000 citizens signed
  a petition supporting honest advertising of pregnancy counselling
  services. The current campaign aims to inform Australians that if they
  want another RU486-type victory - an empowering piece of legislation by
  women for women - they need to make their support for the right of all
  Australians to truthful advertising clear.
  
  Will a pro-transparency groundswell of public support be enough? I think
  yes. While well-funded and organised, supporters of deceptive and
  misleading advertising are few in number. I feel confident that the
  majority of decent Australians - once they realise that existing
  consumer protection legislation leaves a vulnerable group of women out
  in the cold - will act to ensure their elected representatives know that
  they strongly support change.
  
  Regardless of their personal view of abortion, most Australians
  understand that truth in advertising is the basis of informed consent
  and individual choice, and that these principles - core to our liberal
  pluralist democracy - must not be traded away.

  The government is in trouble in the polls and the Prime Minister claims
  there’s no rabbits in the hat. Maybe, but I’m skeptical. Both history
  and early policy signs - the reduction of benefits available to new
  migrants, the Federal government’s consideration of a ban on HIV
  positive migrants - suggests that as polling day draws closer, there
  will be rabbits. The same ones that have been stewed before.
  
  The multicultural “wedge” is all about the so-called Howard Battlers,
  the economically liberal, socially conservative swing voters shamelessly
  courted by both major parties. Its existence reminds us how easy it is
  to divide Australians over multiculturalism, though the real question is
  why.
  
  It would be silly to deny that fear of difference amongst segments of
  the population, and its kissing cousin racism, play a role. But a
  perception of unaddressed weaknesses in the multicultural credo may also
  be to blame.
  
  At the heart of multiculturalism is an assertion about the positive
  nature of difference and the benefits that homogenous societies gain by
  accepting different religions, ethnic, racial, cultural, and linguistic
  groups, and assisting them to maintain and share their knowledge,
  perspectives and cultures. Behind such claims is the unarticulated
  presumption that the only apects of culture that migrants seek to
  preserve, and to share with the wider community, are those Ayaan Hirsi
  Ali recently described as [sentimental]() language, music, culinary
  traditions and cultural and religious rituals.
  
  Australians opposed to the intake of non-Anglo migrants and the respect
  afforded to such sentimental differences by cultural institutions like
  schools and governments - the yearly outcry against cr&egrave;ches that
  celebrate multiple religious festivals in December rather than just
  Christmas is the classic - appear to be motivated by nothing more lofty
  than racism, prejudice based on stereotype, ignorance, fear and
  xenophobia. This makes the short shrift supporters of multiculturalism
  have given their concerns understandable and justified.
  
  But events here and overseas have shown that some religious and cultural
  minorities in western countries like Australia - recent migrants and
  denizens of longer lineage - have sought to maintain more than the
  sentimental aspects of their culture. Most confronting has been the
  home-grown terrorists motivated by fanatical misogynist theocratic
  values brought from other lands. The London bombers, the 17 men arrested
  for conspiring to storm the Canadian parliament and bomb power plants in
  Ontario, the group of Sydney and Melbourne men charged with
  terrorism-related offences and Mohammed Bouyeri, the second generation
  Dutch man who murdered progressive filmmaker Theo van Gogh all appeared
  to be motivated by a parallel set of values fundamentally at odds with
  those central to western democratic societies. Values they felt strongly
  enough about to kill.
  
  Ali, the Somali-born critic of Islam who was Bouyeri’s next intended
  target, argues that western citizens cannot afford to tolerate
  sub-groups in the community with militant values that reject democracy
  and the rule of law, and privilege group entitlements and solidarity
  over individual rights. Tolerance of the intolerable, she suggests,
  leads to the grievous oppression of women and puts them, and the
  community as a whole, at risk of violence.
  
  Her comments, made recently at the Commonwealth Club in California, were
  about migrant communities, but they seem no less true when applied to
  cultural and religious sub-groups with Anglo roots or long lineages in
  Australia. If migrant groups are rightly prohibited from mutilating the
  genitals of their girls in the name of culture and religion, why should
  the refusal of non- migrant religious groups to hire women for
  leadership positions because they are women or as teachers in their
  schools because they are unmarried - both clear violations of state and
  federal anti-discrimination law - be allowed to stand? If we rail
  against the misogynist violence-condoning theology preached by migrant
  religious leaders like Sheik Taj Din al-Hilali, why should we turn a
  blind a eye to the misogynist cant streaming from some fundamentalist
  Christian and Jewish pulpits?
  
  The preservation by religious, ethnic and cultural minorities of their
  unique language, music, food, cultural and religious rituals - and the
  sharing of these differences with the wider community - has enriched,
  enlivened and enlarged Australian society. It is the positive fruits of
  Australian multiculturalism of which we may feel justifiably proud.
  
  But when minority groups preserve and seek to disseminate a parallel set
  of deep values that preach - and lead to the practice of - oppression or
  violence against Australians within the group and outside of it, we have
  a problem. It doesn’t matter if those preaching oppression and violence
  have an Anglo, or a long, lineage in Australia, of if they just arrived.
  What matters is the threat they pose to our security and the capacity of
  every one of us, regardless of their gender or age, to exercise rights
  and freedoms guaranteed by law.
  
  So where does this leave the rabbits, and those who wish to defend them,
  as electoral hunting season nears?
  
  Not, I believe, without ammunition or a warren to defend. Racism is
  unacceptable and the preservation and celebration of sentimental
  differences between peoples in democratic pluralist societies has and
  will continue to be a key source of their vibrancy and success. These
  truths are the foundation stones of multiculturalism.
  
  The multicultural project is a sound one. We just need to know where to
  draw the line.

  I love Right to Life President Margaret Tighe. After years of dealing
  with anti-choice activists who pretend their feminists, researchers, and
  medical ethicists - anything but foot soldiers for God - her
  straight-talking misogyny is like a breath of fresh air. With Margaret,
  women who seek abortions know just where they stand.
  
  Take her response to Tuesday’s announcement by Labor MP Candy Broad that
  she will introduce a Private Member’s Bill to decriminalise abortion.
  “If this legislation is passed, wild ducks in Victoria will have more
  protection than unborn children.”
  
  Actually, wild ducks have no legal protection in Victoria, but such
  comments provide a pithy summary of how Tighe and the tiny minority of
  Australians who agree with her rate women’s capacities as ethical
  decision makers (if you missed it, we’re the sporting shooters from
  which our fetuses need legal protection). From such disdainful views of
  women’s moral agency flow anti-choice enthusiasms for the perpetuation
  and enforcement of criminal laws they know don’t stop women having
  abortions, but maximize the shame and pain they experience in doing so.
  
  Some Victorians believe that the current confused system - where the
  criminal law prescribes jail for women and doctors who “procure
  miscarriages”, but the common law forgives their felonious behaviour in
  cases where the abortion is deemed proportional and necessary to prevent
  serious danger to the women’s life or health - is working just fine.
  
  But they’re wrong. The retention of statutes only rarely enforced makes
  the law an ass. It also allows anti-choice crusaders wedged at various
  points in the legal system to prosecute whenever they choose. This is
  what happened in 1986 to Queensland Drs Peter Bayliss and Dawn Cullen,
  in 1998 to West Australian Drs Victor Chan and Hoh Peng Lee and to the
  former head of the ultrasound unit at the Royal Women’s Hospital in
  Melbourne who was pursued for 6 and one half years by anti-choice
  Liberal politician Julian McGuaran before finally being cleared last
  year. And when one doctor is prosecuted the rest get nervous, reducing
  the services they provide and so undercutting women’s access to timely,
  professional care.
  
  But love it or hate it, the introduction of Ms Broad’s bill has made
  history of the current legal framework for abortion. Access and equity
  for women can only go forwards - or backwards - from here. This is
  because it was one thing for successive parliaments to refuse to debate
  decriminalization, but would be quite another for the 2007 Victorian
  Parliament to affirm of the criminality of aborting women and their
  doctors. Should Ms Broad’s attempt to repeal abortion from the criminal
  code fail, in other words, the costs to women and couples of
  reproductive age could be devastating. Not only will the stigma attached
  to abortion increase, but access will likely decline as medicos retreat
  to their bunkers to await signs of what the renewed legal landscape
  holds for them and their patients.
  
  Unplanned pregnancy is a fact of life. The World Health Organisation
  estimates that even if couples contracepted perfectly every time, there
  would be nearly six million accidental pregnancies every year. At the
  heart of the debate on repeal is the question of who should decide. When
  Health Minister Bronwyn Pike insists abortion can’t be pulled out of the
  Crimes Act without something else being put it (rendering the entire
  descriminalisation project moot in one fell swoop) she stands as one
  with Margaret Tighe in assessing politicians, doctors - anyone but the
  pregnant woman herself - as best qualified to know when an abortion is
  justified. The Premier and Treasurer Brumby’s support for transferring
  existing common law restrictions to the Health Act is more of the same.
  As well, they show the government, even at this early stage of the
  debate, as running scared.
  
  Personally, I wouldn’t mind seeing the Premier, Brumby and the
  supposedly pro-choice Health Minister stand up for women for a change. I
  mean, what else could they possibly be saying by insisting on the need
  for legal “safeguards” to prevent “unfettered access” than that the law
  is the only thing that stops women getting pregnant will-nilly for the
  sheer pleasure of being able to abort? Not only are such claims
  insulting and completely clueless about the way women approach the
  crisis of unplanned pregnancy, they bear no basis in fact. The ACT
  repealed abortion from the criminal code in 2002 and has reported no
  change in procedure rates, while countries where abortion is legal and
  accessible, like Belgium and the Netherlands, enjoyi some of the lowest
  rates in the world.
  
  Like it or not, the position politicians and the public take on repeal
  reflects their view of women as moral decision-makers. Those in favour
  trust women’s judgment on questions concerning their own bodies and
  lives, while those against don’t.
  
  Whatever your view, the time to express it - to Bracks, Brumby, Pike and
  most importantly your own MP - is now. Rest assured Miargaret Tighe’s
  crew will.

  It’s Time to Tell. The slogan is back, along with the second phase of
  the Infertility Treatment Authority’s campaign to inform parents of how
  Victoria’s infertility laws may affect their lives, and parenting
  choices.
  
  We’ve learned a lot since the Telling Campaign got under way last year.
  Then, the panic was about the legal rights of Victorian donors to
  identifying information about any child born from their sperm or less
  eggs. The problem was - and remains - that the majority of
  donor-conceived kids don’t know the truth about their conception. One
  Victorian study found only 37% of parents had told their kids, while
  international figures suggest that somewhere between 43% and 82% of
  parents never intend to tell. As the first batch of kids affected by the
  legislation turned 18, donors choosing to pursue their rights under the
  law could have been the first to break the news to offspring that they
  were donor-conceived.
  
  As it turns out, much of that panic may have been misplaced. The truth
  is that very little was - and still is - known about the motivations of
  sperm donors. When modern infertility treatment methods were in their
  infancy, donors tended to be young men motivated by money, and
  appreciative of the anonymity that has long surrounded donation. But as
  donor-conceived children began asserting a “right to know,” donor
  recruitment strategies began to change and with them, the motivational
  profiles of donors.
  
  A recent analysis of such changes suggests that when it comes to sperm
  donors, you get what you pay for. If infertility treatment services
  offer men a fee for service (something not allowed in Australia) and
  guarantee them anonymity, they wind up with a pool of donors primarily
  motivated by money and anxious to preserve their anonymity. If services
  don’t pay and require all donors to consent to being identified, they
  tend to recruit older “family men” with altruistic motivations and a
  commitment to disclosure and openness.
  
  So far, altruistic, respectful and compassionate appear to be good
  descriptors of the pool of donors affected by Victoria’s 1984
  Infertility (Medical Procedures) Act. Descriptions that should perhaps
  not be all that surprising given that since the middle of 1988, men
  donating sperm in this state have known not just about their legal
  rights to seek identifying information about resulting children, but
  their obligations to disclose identifying information about themselves,
  too.
  
  The Infertility Treatment Authority has been evaluating the
  effectiveness of the Time to Tell Campaign in informing parents of
  donor-conceived children about what the legislation means for them.
  Their data, made public for the first time today, suggests that the
  approximately 58 donors who gained a right to seek identifying
  information about just over 100 young adult in 2006 - a request that
  might have disclosed to the donor-conceived adult time that they were
  donor-conceived - were pretty swell guys.
  
  Yes, these men had the right to apply for the identifying information
  that Victoria’s laws - unique in this respect - granted them. And they
  could have pursued this entitlement with little concern about the
  potential impact their voyage to knowledge might have had on the family
  their donation helped create.
  
  But they didn’t. Instead, the twenty-seven donors that contacted the ITA
  in search of information and support, many went away satisfied with an
  application for non-identifying information about their offspring, or
  the contribution of their details to the Authority’s voluntary register
  for ready access by offspring or parents seeking information.
  
  The few who did chose to exercise their lawful entitlement to
  identifying information had offspring that had not yet reached the age
  of 18, meaning the child’s parents retained the right to give - or
  refuse - consent for its release. To date, according to the Victorian
  Law Reform Commission, the majority of donors have respected “…the
  privacy of the recipient families and have no intention of applying for
  information about the person conceived with their gametes. Instead, they
  are willing to make themselves available should the child or young adult
  wish to make contact in the future.” In summary, says the ITA’s CEO
  Louise Johnson, “Donors have been very sensitive to the needs of
  families formed from their donation.”
  
  It is early days yet. Two hundred more Victorians conceived by donation
  pass through the portal to adulthood this year, and accompanying them
  will be another lot of donors with unknown ideas about identity, family,
  genes and privacy, to name just a few. Such unknowns should hasten the
  state government’s implementation of the Victorian Law Reform
  Commission’s recent recommendation that the right of donors to apply for
  identifying information be repealed. It should also ensure support for
  the Infertility Treatment Authority’s decision to accede to the requests
  of parents to place a note on the register informing information-seekers
  that the child is not aware she is donor-conceived.
  
  None of this is to say parents shouldn’t tell. They should, and as early
  in a child’s life as possible, in accordance with a growing body of
  research suggesting that children told before age ten find it easy to
  integrate their non-conventional conception story into their evolving
  identity. But coercion must be taken out of the mix and replaced with
  facilitative interventions like the Time to Tell Campaign - supportive,
  respectful, information-rich - that enable parents to find their own
  time to tell.

  There’s always a moment of truth. For me, it came a few weeks ago, on my

  Because there are two things I do know. One is that shame is corrosive
  and, left unchallenged, takes years to undo.
  
  The other is that according to one survey just over half of British
  women intend to have plastic surgery, and 11% have done so already. In
  Australia, around 50,000 people - mostly women, but a growing number of
  men - go under the knife each year, with 260,000 more undertaking
  non-surgical procedures like Botox.
  
  Might doesn’t make right, but what such figures do imply is that if
  face-lifts (liquid or solid) really do cross some moral dividing line,
  we’re going to have to unearth the motives of the traversing hordes to
  get a fix on the problem, and find a solution.
  
  In the meantime, if I can afford it, I’m going to keep dodging my date
  with destiny. I may even consider surgery some day.
  
  What I won’t do is rabbit away the next time someone tells me I look
  good for my age. The time for truth-telling has come.

  It’s far from over, with many still shouting. But as the conga line of
  those condemning Channel 7 for broadcasting the news that two AFL
  players had been referred for illicit drug use grows, we need to ask
  ourselves: are we shooting the messenger?
  
  The noisy majority contends that medical records are sacrosanct, and
  that Seven behaved like slime not just by paying for such tainted goods,
  but broadcasting their contents.
  
  Let’s look at the facts. On Friday the 24th, Seven reported that two
  senior AFL players had been referred for drugs treatment under the
  league’s illicit drugs policy. The story came from medical records
  provided by a couple in their thirties who claimed to have found them in
  a gutter outside a rehabilitation centre, but were eventually arrested
  for stealing them. The network had paid $3000 to obtain the documents. A
  player boycott is now in force.
  
  But while everyone agrees that medical records should remain
  confidential, few have asked whether it is reasonable to assign the
  obligation to achieve this to a television network.
  
  Medical institutions and health professionals are certainly obliged to
  respect patient confidentiality. Medical students learn early of their
  duty not just to keep mum about what happens in the consulting room, but
  to take all reasonable steps to ensure the contents of patient records
  are not disclosed. This is not just because medical practitioners have
  an obligation to foster the autonomy of their patients, but because they
  recognise that people will only come forward for advice and treatment -
  particularly about stigmatised conditions like abuse, mental illness and
  substance use - if they know their secrets will be safe.
  
  Are journalists obligated to keep patient records private, too? The
  Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance’s Code of Ethics notes that
  journalists should “respect…personal privacy” but offers little guidance
  on how such respect should be demonstrated, or balanced against the
  public interest. The Australian Communication and Media Authority’s
  Guidelines stipulates that news and current affair programs must not use
  material relating to a person’s personal or private affairs, or which
  invades an individual’s privacy, other than where there is an
  identifiable public interest reason for the material to be broadcast.
  
  Journalists seem to agree that there was a case for running the story.
  Last Thursday, senior journalist at the Australian Cameron Stewart
  described it as a “cracking yarn” that “every media outlet in Melbourne
  would have reported…if it had come from the police, or the club, or from
  the players themselves.”
  
  The question then, is whether Channel 7 got the balance - between their
  obligation to protect the privacy of the AFL players and their duty to
  act in the public interest - right. Seven’s Melbourne news director
  Steve Carey contends that people at senior levels of sport who use
  illicit drugs fail to provide role models for kids. This view drove his
  decision to run the story, though he attempted to balance what he saw as
  the public’s right to know with the players’ right to privacy by
  omitting their names - though not the name of the club - from the
  broadcast.
  
  Was Carey right to prioritise the interests of his viewers in a full
  picture of drug use in the AFL over the players’ and League’s interest
  in non-disclosure?
  
  Certainly, if I‘d been in Carey’s shoes that fateful night, I would have
  made a different call. I support the AFL’s three strikes policy, which
  appears to have been the indirect target of the story Seven put to air.
  I would have prioritised the players’ expectations of privacy over the
  story, which I see as more of a “”of interest to the public" than “in
  the public interest” one.
  
  But this is not the point. What matters is our acceptance that a
  balancing act was required, even if we disagree with the judgment of the
  balancer.
  
  I’m not trying to bury Seven, or to praise the network, either. My point
  is simply that while we are right to feel angry about the unauthorized
  disclosure of private medical records, we need to direct our anger
  appropriately. Seven didn’t steal the medical records, or negligently
  allow them to be pinched. If they were ignorant of the fact they had
  been stolen (a very key if), then the network had a very real moral
  dilemma on its hands. One, it seems worth mentioning, that it and other
  news organizations may face again.
  
  Journalists are often in receipt of unauthorized information, the
  broadcast of which is undoubtedly in the public interest. Deep Throat
  wasn’t authorized to guide Woodward and Bernstein to the Watergate
  scandal ,and Alan Kessing’s confidential report on security breaches at
  Sydney airport - which eventually led to a $200 million update of
  airport security - wasn’t supposed to find its way into the press,
  either.
  
  What happens when a journalist is leaked the records of a candidate for
  high office who has been diagnosed with a fatal cancer he had failed to
  disclose to the public? Or when the psychiatric records of a convicted
  pedophile due for imminent release - showing several treating doctors
  deeming him incurable and likely to re-offend - fall off the back of a
  truck near a newsroom?
  
  Will we all be screaming about the confidentiality of medical records,
  unauthorized disclosure and privacy rights then? Will we shoot the
  messenger?
  
  Or will we recognize the fine and fuzzy line the news media tread every
  day to keep their profits healthy, yes, but also to ensure their
  responsibility to inform the public is met.

  Ingrates. That’s the word that keeps coming to mind when the Canberra
  lesbian case is raised. That, and some vital misapprehension of what
  parenting - at its core, and in its specifics - is all about.
  
  Sadly, the fact that the parents involved happen to be lesbians has
  impeded our capacity to get at the heart of what bothers us about this
  case. And trust me, this is irrelevant. In the recent Australian past,
  other parents - a single straight woman from New South Wales, an older
  heterosexual couple from Queensland - have sought compensation in the
  courts for medical negligence that resulted in a child being born where
  none was wanted.
  
  Courts have traditionally frowned on compensating couples for children
  “wrongly born” because doctors failed to diagnose a pregnancy when
  abortion was still an option, or incompetently performed a
  sterilisation, or any other act of medical negligence resulting in the
  birth of a healthy child where all reasonable attempts had been made to
  avoid just this outcome. The reason was that they believed, and felt all
  of us out here in TV land should believe too, that the birth of a
  healthy child is always a “gift from God” or a “blessing.”
  
  But this is rubbish. Every time we use contraception or, when
  contraception fails, seek abortion we frankly acknowledge that we don’t
  wish to be “blessed” that way.
  
  And the truth is that if - as was the case for so long - gross medical
  negligence resulting in the birth of a healthy child is consequence-free
  for dodgy doctors, it’s hard to see how they’ll not be more dodgy
  doctors in the future. Not to mention the legitimate need some suing
  parents have for compensation monies to feed, cloth and educate a child
  they’d not planned to have, and are missing out on educational and
  employment opportunities to raise.
  
  Yet such cases do leave a bad taste in the mouth. One reason is the
  image most people can’t help but get of the child involved - in some
  cases old enough to read the papers or listen to the news - discovering
  that they had not been wanted, and the precise details of what their
  birth had cost their parents in emotional, physical and monetary terms.
  The fact that such children also have to cope with the fact that others
  know they weren’t wanted adds to the sense that parents who bring such
  suits - through their betrayal of their child’s trust and failure to
  protect their child from hurt - fundamentally misunderstand what
  parenthood is about.
  
  Which is, in my view, unconditional love. A number of years ago a
  childless-by-choice colleague expressed amazement at people’s
  willingness to make commitments to live with, love and nurture for
  several decades a person they don’t even know. To volunteer, in other
  words, for the duties of parenthood.
  
  He is right. Parental volunteerism is amazing, and points to what - when
  it is done well - is so morally admirable about those who raise children
  well. From the first sighting of those double lines through the plastic
  test window until the car with the tin cans and streamers drives away,
  the experience of parenthood confounds expectations, preferences and
  even heartfelt desires. You wanted a natural birth but ended up with a
  C-section, hoped for a girl but got a boy, intended to breastfeed but
  ended up bottle-feeding, wished for an athletic kid to take to the rugby
  but wound up with a bookish one who preferred Scouts.
  
  That your children sometimes disappoint, that the experience of
  parenting was not what you expected is par for the course and clearly
  spelled in the small print in the implied parental contract that
  accompanies each bundle of joy. The challenge is not just to accept the
  unpredictability of the experience, but to revel in it. To demonstrate
  the virtues of good parenthood not just by having the grace to accept
  the unexpected, but to make the best of it by showing a love devoid or
  strings or reservations for your child each and everyday, whoever that
  child turns out to be.
  
  Difficult? You betcha, but then nothing that brings joy, engenders
  self-respect and earns the admiration of others is easy. And done
  properly, parenthood is one of the mot rewarding and respect-worthy
  undertakings in the world.
  
  Perhaps where the Canberra couples, and other parents who sue for
  children “wrongfully born” fail is not knowing where to draw the line.
  Yes, parenthood today is not what it was yesterday and most of us feel
  it is justified, even morally required, to exercise control where we can
  by contracepting, screening prenatally, choosing abortion. . To avoid or
  refuse the hefty responsibilities of parenthood when we feel we can’t
  manage them and be the kind of parent we wish to be.
  
  But at some point in the proceedings a line is crossed. The line beyond
  which control - responsible or otherwise - can no longer be exercised.
  Where the only moral option is to quit kicking and accept the outcome -
  the living, breathing, feeling, vulnerable outcome - with good grace and
  hand in hand, to step into the dark in search of light.
  
  To say a child has been born. Let us rejoice.

  Sex work is back in the news. Having hardly been broached in polite
  conversation since the state government’s “tolerance zone” policy for
  street sex work went down in flames five years ago, the West Australian
  government’s decision to descriminalise and regulate indoor prostitution
  has refocused minds around the country on the best way to manage the
  world’s oldest profession.
  
  As a feminist academic and long-time St Kilda resident, I’ve been
  thinking about these issues for a long time. Only recently, however,
  have I arrived at what I think is a fair and sensible approach to the
  issue, one that recognises women as moral agents capable of accepting
  both the rights and responsibilities associated with selling sex.
  
  It looks like this.
  
  Advocates and opponents of decriminalisation adopt extreme
  characterisations of women to justify their positions. On one side are
  the decriminalisation advocates - self-proclaimed unions or advocacy
  groups for prostitutes - who contend that sex work is a job like any
  other, that women have a right to perform this “work” whenever and
  wherever they like, and that society is obliged to regulate to protect
  sell-sellers from the inherent risks associated with having serial sex
  with unknown men.
  
  In the opposing corner are the radical feminists and members of the
  religious right. For this unholy alliance, prostitution is always a
  violent and exploitative encounter that, by definition, no competent
  woman would ever choose to participate in. As two Norwegian scientists
  put it, “no-one wants to rent out her vagina as a garbage can for hordes
  of anonymous men’s ejaculations”. Dismissing with an imperious hand-wave
  the claims of some prostitutes that they freely choose to sell their
  bodies, real and pseudo radical feminists and religious wowsers persist
  in describing all sex-sellers as victims whom they must protect by
  promulgating and enforcing no- tolerance policies.
  
  The victim-approach to managing street prostitution is objectionable on
  a number of grounds. These include its obnoxious paternalism, and the
  disingenuous way in which political agitation designed to impose the
  agitator’s view of what is best on everyone else is dressed up as
  selfless “feminist” advocacy on behalf of women. But most offensive is
  the way in which the argument itself victimises sex-sellers by denying
  their experience and stripping them of their agency. Such
  objectification allows the no-tolerance posse to dismiss everything
  sex-sellers say about their experience - when they don’t say things that
  support the no-tolerance position - as false consciousness or further
  evidence of victimhood. For instance, Gunilla Ekberg, the co-executive
  director of the International Coalition Against Trafficking in Women,
  explains the support some prostitutes give to decriminalization as
  evidence of their desire to “defend their own dignity” in a violent
  context that “they can’t change”.
  
  Abandoning the all or nothing approach, and recognizing the indisputable
  fact that some women do choose to sell sex, while others don’t,
  incarnates a realistic and fair approach for the management of indoor
  and outdoor sex in liberal democracies. A position where sex sellers are
  moral agents worthy of respect - instead of pitiable victims in need of
  paternalistic protection - that have both rights and responsibilities
  with regard to how they ply their trade. Insofar as the consequences of
  their choice to sell sex remains with them, competent adult women (and
  men) should be free to sell their bodies, however strongly some in the
  community object. However, like other choosers, when the consequences of
  the selling choice restricts the capacity of fellow citizens to exercise
  their freedoms, the state is obligated to restrict their activity.
  
  A focus on autonomous choice also justifies state intervention where sex
  workers lack the capacity - because they are too young, mentally ill,
  sexually or physically abused or drug addicted - to make choices about
  selling sex that are worthy of the name.
  
  What this cashes out to are policies that decriminalize and
  constructively regulate indoor prostitution, and prohibit street
  solicitation and sex. Behind this approach is a rebuttable presumption
  that adult women who sell sex are autonomous, and that communities
  affected by street sex suffer an unjustified loss of amenity and
  security. Such policies address the very real potential for exploitation
  and coercion in the sex trade by offering sex-sellers real opportunities
  to exit like income support, places in drug rehabilitation programs and
  police intervention in violent relationships at regular intervals at
  their “workplaces” and each time they have contact with the law. The
  availability of such programs to women working indoors should give us
  confidence that sellers are choosing this way of life, while offering
  street prostitutes - when combined with fines and jail terms for punters
  - a real opportunity to either move inside or to exit the trade.
  
  Women who are truly moral agents must accept both the rights and
  responsibilities that accompany their choices. I think it vital that
  public language and policy concerning women - particularly as sexual and
  reproductive beings - validate us as citizens capable of both making
  choices, and living with their consequences. Autonomous adult women have
  a right to sell sex providing they go about it in ways that don’t
  unfairly burden the community of which they are a part, though as a
  community we have a positive obligation to ensure that at every stage of
  what is potentially a violent, exploitative and coercive game a woman’s
  freedom to say “no” is protected.
  
  This is why allowing brothels to operate in a regulated fashion is a
  good idea, but street sex work can never be tolerated. Not just because
  a disproportionate number of street prostitutes are too young, too
  drug-addicted, too psychologically scarred or cowed by violence or abuse
  to make an autonomous choice to sell themselves, but because the cost to
  the community of their behaviour, even if theirs is a choice worthy of
  the name, is far too high.

  In Viro Fertility Goddess by Jodi Panayotov. Blink Press, June 2007, pp.
  218. ISBN 978~~0~~9803110~~0~~6
  
  TEASE: Infertility sucks and IVF is worse. Yet women rarely talk about
  either, or make jokes, a truth Jodi Panayotov found out the hard way
  when aged 37 she struggled to get pregnant and to stay that way.
  
  It never fails to amaze me the insensitive things people say to women
  who, after a few years of wedded bliss, fail to spawn. The comment by
  Panayotov’s fellow stewardess is typical. “You’ve been married for years
  now, when are you going to have a baby?”
  
  How I wish all women would react as Panayotov did that day. “Actually, I
  just lost one, miscarriage you know.”
  
  When a non-pregnant stewardess approaches Panayotov shortly after this
  incident to confide that she’d also had a miscarriage but had only told
  her family about it, Panayotov responds with a question revelatory of
  the driving motivation behind In Vitro Fertility Goddess. “Why is it we
  don’t talk about it? It’s like there ‘s a hidden code of silence of
  something. I’ve never in ten years of working here heard of one
  miscarriage. And I’ve heard all about every birth.”
  
  In Vitro Fertility Goddess is Panayotov’s attempt to talk, even laugh,
  about the reproductive difficulties faced by she and her husband Michel.
  From the early days of her journey where repeated miscarriages saw her
  join “the freakish underclass somewhere between the Fertile and
  Infertile” that only exists on “obscure websites” because “nobody…admits
  to being [a] member,” to Panayotov’s reluctant commencement of IVF,
  Infertility Treatment Goddess contributes to the growing recognition
  that women suffer psychic and physical costs not just when they are
  unable to control their bodies and their lives in order to avoid having
  children, but when such control eludes them when they try to conceive.
  
  In Vitro Fertility Goddess has much going for it. Taking a stylistic
  leaf out of Bridget Jones’s Diary it is at times laugh-out-loud funny. A
  medical receptionist retreats when a miscarrying Panayotov yells at her,
  “as if a large dog has mounted and is attempting to have sex with her.”
  When Panayotov confesses to seeing a herbalist to cure her fertility
  woes, her IVF doctor goes “all quiet,” as if she were confessing to
  “joining the Branch Davidians or something.” And like Brigette Jones, it
  promises and delivers an insight into the minds of women whose
  circumstances rather than choices have derailed their lives from
  conventional female courses, and a conclusion (one we know about from
  the start courtesy of the mother-baby photo gracing the book’s back
  cover) that rewards the heroine’s struggles with happy-ever-afters.
  
  What works less well is the unevenness of the book’s tone and style, the
  unreflective way the text conflates embryos and babies and the
  unmitigated bitchyness of the author’s lambasting of fertile women as
  either “smug pregnants” or selfish aborters whose mere existence
  demonstrates an insensitivity to Panayotov’s plight that makes her wish
  to purchase a voodoo doll so she can prick them in effigy.
  
  Few, if any of these not insubstantial problems, are Panayotov’s fault.
  Authors are not editors, and this book reads like the first draft a
  promising manuscript, rather than the final text of a published work.
  Grammatical errors, contradictions and repetitiveness (we are told twice
  about a neighbour’s front window sticker welcoming dogs but not
  children, and as many times about the unsavoury details of the clinic
  masturbation room in which husband Michel fulfils his end of the IVF
  bargain), the loss of Bridget Jones voice during parts of the narration
  and a complete absence of humour during what was clearly the most
  emotionally trying part of the Panayotovs’ journey to parenthood are
  just the sort of problems the editorial process is designed to identify
  and assist the author to address.
  
  That it failed to do so, and that Panayotov’s editor was her husband
  Michel, not only underscores the essential nature of editing to the
  production of quality Australian literary works, but the need for that
  editorial input to be professional: both skilled and impartial.

  Ive been wanting to write this column all year, but dreading it, too.
  Because I don’t want to be misunderstood and I don’t want to offend. But
  the truth is that there is something horribly rotten going on in my
  personal world and \_ because the personal is political \_ this nation.
  The rot comes from the way we fund our schools. And it is making me so
  angry (or is it so grief-stricken and guilty?) that I can hardly breath.
  
  The Federal Government’s education policy, and that of the Rudd
  Opposition, waxes lyrical about parental choice. But while most of the
  parents I have known since our babies napped side by side at creche
  ummed and ahed between private schools A, B and C \_ and the one local
  public school \_ our finances meant that even though several of the
  independent schools are just down the street from our house, my choice
  was between the local public school and well, the local public school.
  Some choice.
  
  For every dollar the Federal Government spends on a child in public
  school, $5.63 is expended on a child in a Catholic or other
  non-government school. Among OECD countries, Australia ranks third in
  the amount of public money spent on private education. In the last
  budget, federal funding to private schools increased by $1.7 billion
  over five years, while public got just $300 million over the same
  period.
  
  Despite the stark disparity of such figures, parents of public school
  kids find it hard to cry foul. Mainly, I think, because of a fear that
  doing so makes us look like we believe money is everything, and that
  admitting the truth - that depriving public schools of funds makes
  private schools “better” - damages our kids’ schools even more. The
  truth is that public school teachers and administrators are the moral
  heroes of our time, sewing more silk purses from the sow’s ears of tatty
  and diminishing resources than nearly any other group of professionals.
  And there should be no underestimating the toughness of the job.
  
  Look, I know that gardens, swimming pools, music rehearsal rooms, dining
  areas, grassy quadrangles, polished floors, school-wide climate control
  systems, post–1957 plumbing, regulation sized ovals and the organised
  sporting teams that go with them aren’t the heart and soul of a good
  education. I know because my son’s secondary school doesn’t have any of
  them.
  
  But what about enough specialist teachers to ensure adequate interest
  and diversity in the curriculum? Enough to craft the specialised
  curriculum required by students at the top and bottom end of the bell
  curve? Class sizes appropriate to the subject being taught? Can anyone
  really suggest these are peripheral to the central function of secondary
  schooling? Yet, here too, our school struggles.
  
  The justice issues here are so acute they hurt. In what way do the 70
  per cent of children attending public schools deserve to miss out on the
  resources necessary for them to obtain the fundamentals of a good
  education when the remaining 30 per cent get enough for this, and so
  much more? Why do only the wealthiest parents in the community, and the
  most religious, deserve a real choice about where they educate their
  kids?
  
  But what I really want to talk about is how it feels to be a parent who,
  week after week, and \_ as I look into the future \_ year after year
  watches her child trek out the door to spend all day in an institution
  that try as it might (and it does really try) cannot meet his
  educational needs. A parent who struggles daily with the worst of all
  parental emotions: the feeling that she is letting her child \_ this
  beautiful, intelligent, eminently worthy creature whom she loves more
  than life itself \_ down.
  
  Because while not a bad school, I always knew it was not the best school
  for him. Not best for him because he loves art, but several of the art
  teachers are known terrors. Not for him because he’s passionate about
  sport but there are no pitches or pools, coaches or competitions. Not
  for him because he is a talented student and \_ while there are signs of
  change \_ ideological resistance persists to catering for kids who need
  extension rather than remediation.
  
  “I want to go to Private School A,” he said a few months ago, after
  hearing his closest friend rave about his school camp, curriculum
  options and sporting tutelage. \`\`We can’t afford it," I replied. He
  won’t ask again. He can see how frustrated I am at my inability to give
  him the wonderful educational opportunities we both see dispensed like
  lollies all round us; how sad and guilty I feel that despite the fact
  that we are doing the best we can, our best isn’t good enough. He knows
  I need to stop thinking about, so I can breathe.
  
  It doesn’t have to be like this. True, the gleeful dismantling of the
  public education system by the Howard Government seems more than OK by
  Rudd’s ALP, which recently pledged to preserve the inequitable funding
  formulas that has caused this unjust mess. “No [Schools] Hit List,” a
  recent Labor press release trumpeted to The Parents Who Matter. But for
  parents like me, there will be no Help List either. Instead, Kev has
  offered to pay part of the cost of a laptop. Thankfully the Greens and
  the Democrats have policies that are far better. Can you imagine how
  different things would be,if the 70 per cent of parents whose children
  would benefit from them sent first preferences their way?

  Leslie Cannold and Jane Caro
  
  TEASE: Everyone’s heard of the Mummy Wars. The debate that flies out of
  the box like a bat out of hell every time some dry academic study
  appears about centre-based childcare. Behind all the shouting about
  sample size, confidence levels and expert bias is a shrillness that can
  only come from women who feel accused of being “bad” mummies, or are
  defending their status as “good” mummies.
  
  We don’t acknowledge it, but debates about education funding may be
  similar. Seemingly about funding figures drawn from Federal and State
  budget papers and high-minded disagreements about the role of the market
  in education or education in democracy, the real source of the heat and
  light is far more primal: our desperate desire to be seen as good
  parents. The proof is in the irrationality, wrong-headedness or sheer
  martyred silliness of the responses made to educators, parents, scholars
  and politicians who speak about the undeniable - and worsening - funding
  inequities between public and private schools. Responses that demonise
  those who speak out as dishonest, envious or (our personal favourite)
  unethical.
  
  So, let’s see how the facts stack up.
  
  The most common response to complaints about the grossly unfair way the
  Feds fund schools is to insist that the public system is the
  responsibility of the States. But what has this to do with the moral
  problem that 70% of Federal Government funds go to support the 32% of
  our kids who attend private schools? After all, a wrong is a wrong, no
  matter what gets done afterwards to right it. It is also unclear how
  adding in the state contribution undermines the fact that the public
  system is under-funded given the result of such mathematics still leaves
  some private school students with 62% more resources devoted to their
  education than the average student in a public school. A financial
  advantage - it must be noted - that the Federal government omits to take
  account of when it doles out funds to schools.\
  . \
  Questionable claims are also made by the “yes, but not us” brigade:
  various officialdom from the Catholic schools who - usually as warm-up
  for yet another round of successful Federal alms-collecting - imply that
  their good work among the underprivileged entitles them to ever-larger
  shares of the Federal and State funding pie.
  
  Well, maybe, but a new report by Barbara Preston has found that while
  40% of students in government schools are from low income families, this
  figure is only 25% in Catholic schools (a figure not dissimilar to the
  22% of kids from low income families in other private schools).
  According to Preston, the difference is even greater for those students
  in very low income families, roughly twice as many of whom can be found
  in government schools, as compared to Catholic or other private schools.
  
  And we mustn’t forget the
  “I-work~~5-jobs-and-budget-carefully-and-live-in-a-shoe-box-in-middle-of-the-road-while-cleaning-toilets"parental
  martyrs. Terrified of any changes to government policy that would
  increase fees, this group defends the existing carve-up of Federal funds
  despite the fact that~~ were the public system funded properly - such
  extreme sacrifice would be unnecessary. Worse, they ignore the fact that
  even if they are the winners in the”who is the best parent stakes“,
  allowing this victory to compromise the quality of education available
  in public schools does nothing more than punish the most disadvantaged
  kids for the supposed sins of their parents. We hope that the Australian
  debate about education funding has not yet reached the stage where any
  participant truly believes that only the children of”good" parents merit
  a decent education.
  
  And last, but not least, is the non-sensical claim that parents who pull
  their kids from the public system are doing it a favour, as taxpayers
  couldn’t afford the price tag of quality education for all Australian
  kids, anyway. The reality is that no supporter of public education has
  ever wanted or asked for relief from the cost of providing a first rate
  education for our young. Frankly, we can’t think of a better way to
  spend money. As well, we know that when the last middle class family
  finally leaves the system, Australia will have become the first
  democracy to settle for a public education system that provides - in the
  words of Prime Minister John Howard - a “reasonable safety net” for the
  poor.
  
  So where do we go from here? First we need to be frank - with ourselves
  and with others - about why the subject of school funding gets us so hot
  under the collar. Perhaps just knowing that much of the passion,
  invective and downright nastiness around this debate is driven by our
  very human and understandable anxiety about what kind of parents we are
  will help us all to calm down. Maybe then we’ll be in a position to have
  a reasoned and effective discussion about what - when it comes to
  education- is really best for all Australian children. Even those
  without perfect parents.

  *In our society, who best reflects Jesus’ compassion and sense of
  justice?*
  
  In recent years, courtesy of the Culture Wars, complaints about the
  absence of Jesus, or Christianity more generally, from the gusto-filled
  way Australians celebrate Christmas have crowded our newspapers and
  clogged the airways. This year, In contrast, has been quieter. A pointed
  indicator, perhaps, of the emphatic eviction of John Howard from the
  Lodge, and the promise made by the new tenant of a kindler, gentler
  approach to the demands of multi-cultural and multi-religious Australia.
  
  So what better time for a secular Jew to talk about Jesus? To draw a
  clear line under the terrible decade of narrow-mindedness, intolerance
  and absolutism of the past decade by recalling who the historical figure
  of Jesus of Nazareth was and what he sought to achieve. And, in so
  doing, clear a space at everyone’s holiday celebrations - religious,
  secular or otherwise - to commemorate this justice-seeking defender of
  the dispossessed.
  
  A potted history of the life and time of Jesus would include the fact
  that he was an outsider. Illegitimate and poor in a culture where a
  man’s standing and status among his fellows was entirely dependent on
  his relationship with God. But the privilege of being seen in the eyes
  of God as an Israelite, a member of the chosen people, was not available
  to everyone. Certain people were ruled out on the basis of
  characteristics they neither controlled nor could change - gender for
  instance - while others, the sick and those involved in unclean
  occupations like fishing or tanning, required purification to earn God’s
  forgiveness, and so be welcomed back into the community of upright
  citizens.
  
  But the cost of forgiveness was high, and controlled by the Priestly
  caste of Jews who ran the Temple in Jerusalem. Not only did all Jews at
  that time pay a tithe to the Temple, they were also required to fork out
  for individual rituals - incense- burning, the offering of loaves and
  the sacrifice of animals - ordered to alleviate sin and guilt. But while
  the Priests and their families were the sole beneficiaries of the
  resulting largess, the penitent had no guarantees his offering would
  achieve the desired ends. In fact, the failure of a sacrifice to cure an
  infirmity might make matters worse, confirming God’s continued judgement
  of the sick person as beyond redemption.
  
  That the Temple was corrupt was a widely held view at the time. Jesus’s
  contribution was to imply that it was also unjust. As he criss-crossed
  the Galilee offering forgiveness and healing to the unclean - those
  literally cast outside the gates of their villages and towns to cleanse
  spiritual pollution - his implicit claim was clear. A relationship with
  God, and access to the Kingdom of Heaven, was open to all. That this
  included women and others deemed inherently “unclean” is evidenced not
  just by his many female disciples and benefactors, but by Jesus’s
  explicit rejection of notions of immutable male supremacy to which many
  of his followers were attached. When, in the Gospel of Thomas, Simon
  Peter calls for Jesus to dismiss Mary as disciple because she is “not
  worthy of life,” Jesus replies that he will “guide her to make her
  male…for every female who makes herself male will enter heaven’s
  kingdom”.
  
  While clearly lacking a contemporary feminist sensibility, such remarks
  were radical for the time, entertaining the possibility that those the
  privileged and powerful deemed less than fully human (deservedly
  marginalised and dispossessed, in other words) were capable of being
  seen by God and of reaping all the social status and privileges this
  entailed.
  
  So who among our moral leaders is most like Jesus of Nazareth? Is it
  President of Liberty Victoria’s Julian Burnside QC who battles for the
  rights of the poor to legal representation and for formal justice for
  two of the most reviled groups in western societies: prisoners in
  Guantanamo Bay and asylum seekers? Or Cardinal George Pell, who leads
  the fight against the ordination of women and in a recent book of essays
  accused Catholics who allowed their consciences to shape their values -
  , rather than dictates from the Church hierarchy - of “Donald Duck
  heresy”? Is Dr Jo Wainer, a woman who has dedicated much of her life to
  fighting for legal and social recognition of women’s full humanity, a
  true disciple of Jesus? Or it is Danny Nalliah, President of Catch the
  Fire Ministries and one-time Family First candidate, who asks his
  parishioners to pray that God will “pull down” what he calls [Satan’s
  strongholds]() brothels, gambling places, bottle shops, mosques and
  Freemasons, Buddhist, Hindu and other Temples?
  
  Knowledge of the history of Jesus the man makes the answers clear.
  
  Jesus of Nazareth was a spiritual activist and political radical who
  made enormous personal sacrifices to bring his vision of a more
  compassionate, inclusive and just world to fruition. It is those who
  behave as Christians - a sometimes different group to those claiming to
  be them - who keep Jesus’s radical, truth-seeking, cage-rattling, spirit
  alive
  
  So, as we head off to the beach this summer for a well-earned rest, let
  us remember to honour our modern day Jesus of Nazarereths: the men and
  women who find inequity offensive, and fight for justice for the most
  benighted in our community, often at great personal, professional and
  financial costs. And let us find time to consider how, when 2008 rolls
  around, we might engage in a bit of radical, truth-seeking cage-rattling
  of our own. The sort of cage-rattling designed to make a real difference
  for one of the oppressed, marginalised, forgotten or dispossessed groups
  in the Australian community who quietly thirst for justice.
  
  The sort of cage-rattling that might just turn 2008 into a year to make
  Jesus proud.

  Blink and you’d miss it. That’s the fate of stories in the lead-up to
  Christmas, even explosive ones about the questionable withdrawal of
  life-sustaining treatment from unconscious patients like Paulo Melo.
  
  But we need to remember twenty-nine year old Paulo, critically injured
  in a car accident in Kakadu National Park on December 5th. Just under
  two weeks later, his family were in court, resisting the hospital’s
  decision to discontinue life support. They failed, and on December 19th
  Paulo’s treatment was withdrawn. He died around 16 hours later.
  
  Disputes between doctors and families about the advisability of
  continuing treatment in such circumstances are rare. Families that
  reject medical advice tend to be either deeply religious, struggling to
  come to grips emotionally with the tragedy they face, or convinced
  they’ve witnessed signs of recovery that doctors - having already handed
  down their prognosis - refuse to countenance.
  
  The Melos, who had a Priest by their son’s bed in his final hours, who
  begged the hospital to let Paulo survive until after Christmas or New
  Year and then “we can see,” and who insisted to the end that Paulo was
  showing signs of recovery, could fairly be described as all three. There
  is little doubt their determination to preserve Paulo’s life exasperated
  the medical team at the Royal Darwin Hospital. “We have tried in every
  way to prepare this family for the withdrawal of the mechanical
  ventilation,” Dr Diane Stevens was quoted at the final hearing as
  saying. “We have already…given [them] more than a week to understand
  that he is not going to survive this terrible accident and injuries”.
  
  For Dr Stevens, the medical prognosis was clear, and justified the
  Hospital’s decision to withdraw treatment from Paulo. “[The medical
  team] felt strongly that we could not continue the mechanical
  ventilation as it was futile therapy,” she told the court in a sworn
  statement. “We feel strongly it is not ethical to continue with futile
  therapy”.
  
  Justice Mildren of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory appeared
  convinced, citing the futility of further treatment as one of the
  grounds for denying a continuation of the orders restraining the
  hospital from withdrawing Paulo’s life support. “The difficulty here is
  that the only evidence before me suggests that continuing with the
  current treatment of this patient is futile…There is no evidence to the
  contrary”.
  
  Everyone, doctors most of all, know there comes a point when patients
  are overmastered by their disease and medicine is powerless to
  intervene. The problem has been defining this point with the precision,
  accuracy and ethical cogency required to guide clinical behaviour.
  
  Is treatment one with a 1% chance of success “futile”, or does one with
  a 10% chance qualify? And how, and by whom, should such vital
  probabilities be calculated? Research warns doctors against relying on
  their experience, which is biased towards recollection of cases that
  went wrong, but robust and reliable data is often lacking. Even where it
  exists, its relevance to particular cases is not always clear. And
  doctors can be wrong. In 2000 the courts had to twice restrain those at
  Sydney’s Royal Prince Alfred Hospital from withdrawing “futile”
  treatment from a comatose 37 year old man whose sister, keeping vigil at
  the bedside, insisted was improving. The man eventually recovered.
  
  Perhaps most critically, medical futility does not provide a values-free
  tool by which medicos - and courts - can make objective decisions about
  withdrawing treatment. Instead, it but a mechanism by which medical
  values are allowed to trump those held by non-compliant families of
  critically ill patients. In a recent edition of the British Medical
  Journal, Charles Weijer and Carol Elliott explain how clashes between
  doctors and families over withdrawing treatment are “not about the
  probability that an intervention will work but about the goals that it
  will serve”. For some families, human life - even unconscious life - is
  of greater value than considerations of that life’s quality. In this
  context, the medical ethicists argue, describing as “futile” treatments
  that preserve what may be permanently unconscious life is “suspiciously
  like trying to redefine a debate about conflicting values into a debate
  about medical probabilities. And as doctors are generally the sole
  arbiters of medical probability this amounts to saying to families,
  \`Your values don’t count’”.
  
  Luckily, there is a better way.
  
  Since the late 1990s, a bevy of experts have been arguing that our
  inability to define futility objectively requires us to focus on
  developing a fair process for reaching decisions about withdrawing
  treatment. The American Medical Association, for instance, advocates
  that every institution develop and adhere to such a policy, which should
  include joint decision-making, negotiated resolution of disagreements
  and, if when all else fails, opportunities for families to transfer care
  of their loved one to another doctor. Only when no doctor or hospital
  will accept the patient, may treatment be withdrawn.
  
  The aim of such a policy is not to resolve the values conflict at the
  heart of disagreements about withdrawing treatments, but to ensure the
  power to decide is distributed fairly between the doctors who deal with
  these situations everyday, and shocked and grieving families forced to
  confront it for the first time.

  Something worrying is happening to column readers. They are becoming
  rude. Menacingly rude - and just plain mean - when they don’t agree with
  you.
  
  Get a load of this. “Your article was stupid. How dare you leave out
  [thing I felt was really important here]. You are totally unethical and
  should not be allowed to write in the newspaper ever again”. Or this
  one. “You liar! I have forwarded your article to all my friends so they
  can see the left-wing drivel passing for informed comment these days”.
  
  Perhaps the problem is the role models.
  
  The tabloids have always done it, but in the last few years, the quality
  papers have also begun running columnists who describe those who do, say
  or believe things they don’t agree with as stupid, obnoxious, smug,
  selfish, ignorant, idiots, yobs, whackers, louts, fools, barbarians and
  harpies.
  
  The editorial justification defence for this new “conversational” style
  is simple: it gets readers going. And there seems little argument that
  this is true. Technology takes the guess work out of how many times such
  articles are read, forwarded to friends and blogged about on media and
  other sites in comparison to their more traditional cousins. The number
  of furious and indignant letters to the editor they attract and the book
  contracts, TV guest spots and radio gigs offered to their authors are
  also beyond dispute.
  
  But at what cost? Insults are not a substitute for argument. In fact,
  they may get in the way of it. Traditional opinion writing was designed
  to persuade but tabloid comment polarises. And while it’s true that
  insulting people makes them angry, defensive and resentful - and angry,
  defensive and resentful people are more likely to throw quick,
  thoughtless counterpunches designed to defend their honour and get their
  own back - its hard to see how such “engagement” advances the noble
  goals of public debate that opinion writing was designed to serve: the
  achievement of consensus about the causes and priority of social and
  political problems. A consensus necessary, though not sufficient, to
  those problems being addressed.
  
  It’s important to be clear here. My concern is not with conflict. We
  should not be afraid to disagree, strenuously if necessary, about things
  that matter. The issue is how we express such disagreements, and react
  when others disagree with us. In the academic philosophy department
  where I worked for years, we might spend all morning in a seminar
  describing one another’s arguments as illogical, premised on a falsehood
  or just plain incoherent. Then we’d all go to lunch. Like Christians who
  hate the sin but love the sinner, philosophers are trained to draw their
  swords against ideas they believe erroneous, but to maintain respectful
  - if not fond - relationships with those expressing them. Conflict over
  ideas is just that: nothing personal.
  
  Making it personal - playing the ball, rather than the person - may
  spark people into action in the short term, but there’s little evidence
  it engages in the long run. Indeed, it seems possible that when readers
  react to being described as insecure or stupid," by firing off a furious
  comment to a blog, or calling into a radio station that is using the
  piece as a jumping off point for talkback, they achieve the catharsis
  required for them to move on despite having done little - perhaps even
  nothing - to achieve meaningful or lasting change.
  
  In contrast, though it’s harder work than throwing bombs, winning the
  battle of ideas through persuasion - the old hearts and minds trick -
  lays the foundation for achieving the intellectual engagement and moral
  outrage that sustains a long-term commitment to making the world a
  better place.
  
  If columnists want to open mail from readers that doesn’t make wince or
  feel physically threatened, they are obligated to collectively model
  debating styles that are intellectually rigorous and respectful -
  implicitly and explicitly - of the entitlement of others to disagree.
  
  I can hear the counter-arguments, now. That young people find
  traditional styles of opinion-writing boring and unengaging. That paper
  and web-based newspaper opinion pages are large enough to accommodate
  all sorts of styles. That persuasion is not the only legitimate goal of
  an opinion piece. Provoking, amusing, entertaining, comforting and
  educating readers are also worthy goals.
  
  That’s fine. Disagree with me all you like. Just take care how you put
  your case.

  How many of us are not living our dreams? What’s stopping us? And what
  does dedicating ourselves to closing the gap between what we wanted for
  our lives and how we are actually living them have to do with ethics?
  
  The relevance of this question became clear when meeting for drinks with
  some mates in the run-up to Christmas. “George” had a few too many, then
  blurted out his profound sense of shame about being a green grocer. “I
  feel embarrassed to even tell people that’s what I do,” he confessed.
  Once, he had earned his keep as a musician, but years earlier had given
  it up.
  
  Like most of us, he could produce reasons: the incompatibility of the
  all-hours itinerant lifestyle of rock bands with the demands of a young
  family; the need for a more reliable income. And yet his feelings of
  grief and self-loathing about opportunities lost were palpable.
  
  Some of us have no choice but to sell ourselves short. Perhaps we are
  the main breadwinners in households that barely scrape by or, as was the
  case for a young woman I know, are the only possible carer for a
  dependant relative. Maybe the needs and wants of our partners or
  children are incompatible with ours, and must take precedence in the
  short or long term.
  
  For others, however, the picture is less clear. Research conducted over
  decades confirms that beyond the level of income needed to fulfil our
  basic needs, additional income does not increase our life satisfaction.
  Yet despite this, many of us work longer hours than we want at jobs we
  despise in the desperate hope that one more purchase - the jaunty sports
  car, the renovations, the new dress - will finally deliver the happiness
  our consumerist culture promises (to make matters worse, rises in income
  may transitorily increase our satisfaction, potentially prompting us to
  pursue that next salary rise in search of another emotional rush). For
  men, such hamster-laps on the work-spend wheel may reinforce traditional
  masculine identity, long associated with provision.
  
  Defining our own good, and living our lives in pursuit of it, is at the
  heart of a moral life. Aristotle thought that developing one’s skills
  and talents was essential to the project of living a virtuous life,
  which he understood as synonymous with the pursuit of happiness.
  
  Most of us know that the best way to get the measure of our own lives is
  to imagine ourselves on our deathbeds looking back at our choices and
  deeds. What will we judge as worthy of our time and effort, and what a
  waste of both? Which journeys and detours will we cherish, and which
  will we regret?
  
  Yet most of us avoid the scenario, even when directly invited to
  consider it. Even in the wake of George’s confession that night in the
  pub, my friends were no different. Suddenly, everyone was otherwise
  occupied. “I love this song,” noted one, drumming his hands on the table
  to the beat, while two others simultaneously noticed our empty pots and
  practically cracked heads getting to the bar for another round.
  
  Such avoidance is understandable. The examined life solicits emotional
  attention and remedial response, while the unexamined enables us to
  carry on as we have been. Our lives are the sum total of our decisions,
  though these are not always freely made. To stare at the product of such
  efforts and admit they are wanting is to imply both the possibility and
  necessity for change and its corollary: moral responsibility for failing
  to change it. And the risks don’t end there. Making changes to one’s
  life, particularly fundamental ones that affect spouses and kids, is
  also fraught, with its disruptions and the ever-present possibility that
  things will go badly. Better, some of us clearly feel, to keep head down
  and bum up in the hope that the quantity rather than quality of our
  efforts, and determination to keep faith with the consumerist recipes
  for success with which we will all raised, will eventually find its
  reward.
  
  And if this weren’t enough to keep us on the straight and narrow, our
  rationalisations for avoiding the hard questions may be
  self-reinforcing. It is human nature to strive to reduce dissonance
  between what we do and what we believe, with behaviour shaping our
  thoughts far more powerfully than the other way around. When what we do
  conflicts with our values, in other words, it is our values that tend to
  give way. So, in the same way that those who wish to believe in God
  should simply start praying, those who want to keep faith with the life
  they are currently living need do little more than continue to live it.
  
  For what it’s worth, I need to say that I don’t think its good enough.
  No matter our age, or the things we’ve said or done in the past, it is
  never too late to live the examined lie. To remember the dreams we had
  for ourselves - the talents we sought to develop, the contribution we
  wished to make during our lifetimes both big and small - and to put them
  into action.
  
  To sprint towards the finish line, before it’s too late.

  It’s built into our psyches. How could it not be, with marriage - and
  the implied happy-ever-after - concluding every literary and cinematic
  romantic tale? And then there’s the return of the elaborate, often white
  wedding, costing on average (based on 2004 figures) $36,234. Social
  research shows it, too. We, as a nation, particularly those in our
  dotage, and those in our thirties, believe in the institution of
  marriage.
  
  Our divorce rate only confirms this, if you consider that 56% of
  Australian men, and 45% of women have, or eventually will, tie the knot
  again.
  
  So are we idealists or mugs?
  
  My verdict is mugs. Yes, the one-size-fits-all definition of marriage as
  a lifelong romantic union of choice with “the one” person able to meet
  our every emotional, intellectual and sexual need suits some. But for
  others it is a recipe for disaster.
  
  I can count the number of happy couples I know - or knew - on a single
  digit. But for many the dissatisfactions are not global, but particular,
  boiling down to malcontent in one key area, with the remaining
  fundamentals solid. Despite this, and often amid cries of “don’t go for
  second best” and “you deserve better,” one or both partners will call it
  quits. In the aftermath, many will blame themselves for failing to be
  for their partner, or to have found in them, their everything.
  
  But are we failing at marriage, or is marriage failing us? If we stopped
  blaming ourselves for failing to suit marriage, and started asking why
  marriage doesn’t better suit us, would more of us stay together?
  
  I say, “yes”. Marriage was designed to serve a number of purposes, but
  most relevant to 21st century Australians is that of raising children.
  Research suggests that unless there is violence, children do better in
  intact families than divorced ones, even when parents fight. The reasons
  for this are complex, but include the financial advantages of two-parent
  households, and the dramas caused by divorce, and parental dating and
  re-partnering which may distract children from focusing on - and parents
  from supporting - their project of growing up.
  
  We all have needs, some of which reflect at the most fundamental level
  who we are, what we value and what we require to flourish. For some,
  abandoning hope of having those needs met to maintain the marriage for
  the children’s’ sake seems desperately old-fashioned and unfair. And so
  the divorce.
  
  The alternative - rarely discussed - is to renegotiate the marriage
  contract. Key to such a process is the acknowledgement that the
  inability of the relationship to meet all the needs of both partners is
  the fault of neither, but the result of the inflexible, impersonal and
  unrealistic demands of the institution of marriage itself.
  
  For some, the freedom to negotiate the individual conditions required to
  sustain the relationship could save the relationship in the long-term,
  or at least until the kid leave home. While each individualised marital
  contract will be different, mutual respect, attendance to parental
  obligations and the primacy of the marital relationship over
  extra-marital ones would be likely bottom-line conditions in most.
  
  It may be that some people continue to opt for the standard “you are my
  everything” marriage deal. But for others, tailored contracts with the
  flexibilities required by the individuals involved could make the
  difference between the despair that leads to divorce - with all its
  misery for children - and the contentment that allows couples to stay
  together.

  What’s a Baby-Friendly hospital? If you don’t know, you may soon because
  if the Australian Government’s House Standing Committee Inquiry into
  Breastfeeding has its way, the three that currently exist in NSW are set
  to mushroom.
  
  The report is the most recent in a long line of official moans about the
  stubborn refusal of enough Australian mothers to conform to expert
  advice that they feed their infants only breast milk for the first six
  months.
  
  It is possible to question the Committee’s unqualified assertion that
  every one of the voluminous claims for the health benefits of
  breastfeeding are proven. Last year, an Australian study found no basis
  for medical advice that increasing the duration of breastfeeding and
  delaying the introduction of solid foods prevented asthma or allergies.
  
  But even if breastfeeding offered all the health benefits asserted by
  its proponents, it’s not clear what this says about a woman’s right to
  decide how to feed her infant. Does the superiority of breast milk make
  breastfeeding the best choice for every mother-infant dyad? Does it
  negate the right of women to make informed, voluntary decisions about
  how they feed their infants, and justify policies and practices that
  nudge, manipulate and ever coerce them into “choosing” breastfeeding?
  
  The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, with its stated aim of
  “protect[ing], promot[ing] and support[ing] breastfeeding” says “yes”.
  Indeed, evidence to the Committee suggests women may already be
  suffering from the program’s heavy-handed approach, with mothers who
  used infant formula telling the Committee they felt upset at being
  “treated differently in hospital… pressured by health professionals’
  voicing their opinion at their choice and [not being] provide[ed] infant
  formula in a timely manner”.
  
  Despite this, the Committee recommended the number of Baby-Friendly
  facilities be increased, even though the accreditation standards
  practically require this sort of damaging and disrespectful behaviour.
  For example, Baby-Friendly facilities must “inform all pregnant women
  about the benefits and management of breastfeeding,” “give newborn
  infants no food or drink other than breast milk unless medically
  indicated,” and “give no artificial teats or dummies to breastfeeding
  infants”.
  
  While such demands may be consistent with the program’s aim of
  “increase[ing] the initiation and duration of exclusive breastfeeding,”
  they run counter to the requirements of informed consent, which calls
  for the disclosure of balanced information on both the risks and
  benefits of all feeding options. They also show barely disguised
  contempt for the right of women - not ward staff - to decide what to
  give their infants when it comes to food and care.
  
  The truth is that most breastfeeding advocates think informed consent is
  as useless as tits on a bull when it comes to infant feeding decisions.
  This is because their goal is not to empower women to decide what is
  best for them - based on their own needs and values - but to get as many
  women as possible to do what they believe is best for those women’s
  babies, which is to be breastfed.
  
  This is nothing new. There have always been medical practitioners and
  conservative women’s groups eager to spread their views about what is
  best for other people’s children and, consequently, what mothers must do
  to measure up.
  
  What is odd is the silence of feminists on this issue. Real choice, and
  respect for women as choosers, requires not just that the structural
  constraints on women’s freedom to choose breastfeeding are addressed - a
  vocal concern of some women’s groups - but that a women’s choice to feed
  with formula is respected, too.

  There are 17 selective high schools in New South Wales, and 10 schools
  offering selective classes for academically gifted students.
  
  For those who can’t afford private school fees, or the costs of a home
  in an area blessed with a first-rate public high school, entry to one of
  these selective schools may be their high-achieving child’s only chance
  of getting the education she needs.
  
  So what if you have enough money to send your child to a private school
  that is both able and willing to challenge your gifted child? Is it
  right for you to send your child to a selective school, if she gets in?
  
  This dilemma is all too real. Recently, I read of a couple who were
  frank about their capacity to afford a top private education for their
  son, but moved into the zone of the state’s top public school so they
  could renovate their house, build a swimming pool and avoid becoming
  workforce slaves so they could spend more time with their kids.
  
  Are such choices right? Fair? Does the mere asking of such questions -
  guaranteed to foster a fractious and divisive debate about personal
  ethics - signal the success of State and Federal government strategy to
  wedge the community on the schools issue to distract from their woeful
  neglect of public education and its tragic consequence: the failure to
  provide every child with local public schools able to deliver the
  education they need and deserve?
  
  I think the latter. OK, it’s true. I feel uncomfortable about parents
  choosing to renovate and build a pool instead of paying private school
  fees, but have sympathy for those wishing to work less and spend more
  time with their kids. And I can’t help but admire the decision of a now
  wealthy friend from a middle-class background not to sit his bright
  child for the entry test for the selective high school he credits with
  his success because he wants the place to go to a child in need.
  
  But these are my values, and yours may be different. And the truth is
  that pondering what individuals of conscience do in unconscionable
  situations is not the best way to solve this country’s neglect of our
  children’s educational needs.
  
  Instead, what we need is a paradigm shift. Away from a view of children
  as private possessions (the benefits of which reside solely with their
  parents) and towards one that recognizes them as a public good. Viewed
  this way, the moral problem shifts away from the adequacy of particular
  parents’ sacrifice, and towards the moral obligations of employers and
  governments (which regularly wax eloquent about the need for couples to
  reproduce early and often) to invest in the education of this country’s
  future citizens and workforce.
  
  And the investment currently being made is inadequate, with the Federal
  Government’s own ministerial taskforce making clear that without $2.9
  billion more each year, public schools will be unable to meet what
  Education Ministers of all State, Territory and Commonwealth governments
  agreed were the very goals of schooling in the 21st century.
  
  I think it’s true to say that if the school best placed to meet our
  child’s academic needs was around the corner and free, most of us would
  send our child there.
  
  This makes the key moral question: why can’t most of us say this about
  our local schools, and what - as a nation - do we intend to do about it?

  Transparency. In recent years, journalists, politicians and medical
  researchers have joined lawyers and judges in accepting formal
  obligations to either disclose personal or financial links they have
  with those they report on or serve, to divest themselves of those links
  or to recuse themselves.
  
  This makes it odd then that, when it comes to government inquiries, the
  moral obligations we all have to disclose, divest or recuse where
  conflicts of interests exist, remain optional. I’ve given evidence at a
  fair few inquiries and hearings, and while within the hearing room the
  affiliations of certain witnesses-relevant links that may reveal fiscal
  or moral conflicts of interest - are poorly-kept secrets, what happens
  in the hearing room stays in the hearing room. When the final report
  appears only those credentials that witnesses choose to disclose, rather
  than all those the public might deem relevant, appear in print.
  
  But this may be set to change, with a new report on by the UK Science
  and Technology Committee confronting the issue of witness transparency
  directly.
  
  It all started when the Committee, appointed by the House of Commons,
  undertook an investigation of scientific developments relating to the
  Abortion Act of 1967. When submissions began arriving members noticed
  that some doctors were opining on and interpreting evidence in areas in
  which they had neither practiced, researched nor published. Turns out,
  most of these contributions were from individuals who had a history of
  active campaigning against a woman’s right to choose.
  
  In line with its own previously articulated recommendations on
  evidence-based policy-making, the committee swung into action, requiring
  all witnesses to come clean and, in keeping with “accepted practice in
  the scientific community,” disclose all relevant interests and
  expertise, including previous publication of strong views on abortion,
  or membership of organizations campaigning on the issue.
  
  All hell broke loose. Some pro-lifers did come clean (Australia’s own
  John Fleming, who in Australian debates on abortion tends to describe
  himself as Dr Fleming from the Southern Cross Bioethics Institute, added
  that he was also a Catholic Priest and President of Campion College,
  itself linked with Christendom College whose mission is to make Christ’s
  teachings the law of the land). But others refused, claiming to fear
  that the truth would see their views discounted. Refusing to listen to
  the Committee’s commitment that they would not, they insisted on their
  entitlement to deny the public and lawmakers the whole truth about who
  they were and where they came from.
  
  At the heart of concerns about transparency are those about autonomy,
  the Greek roots of which mean self-rule. To rule our lives we need full
  and accurate information on which to base our decisions. Conflict of
  interest disclosures help us decide how much weight to give to the
  opinions and evidence offered us by those claiming to know. Ignorance of
  all relevant facts about those seeking to influence us undermines the
  integrity of our decisions, weakening our grip on our lives. Because it
  may have been the case that if we had known the whole truth about the
  person whose words and facts swayed us, we might not have given them so
  much weight - and chosen differently - after all.
  
  It is imperative that government inquiries in Australia follow the UK
  lead and demand transparency from all those seeking to inform and
  influence decision-makers and citizens about issues of public
  importance. No more cloak and dagger. We need transparency.
  Evidence-based policy decision-making simply can’t happen without it.

  Many people think that the State government’s commitment to the
  decriminalisation of abortion guarantees a good outcome for women, no
  matter what model ultimately makes it into law.
  
  They are wrong. Legal advice suggests that some models for reforming the
  law could reduce women’s freedom to choose, and their access to quality
  services.
  
  In late March this year, the Victorian Law Reform Commission will offer
  the Brumby government a number of models for reforming the current law
  on abortion. A report just handed down in the UK into scientific d
  evelopments relevant to abortion law has a number of lessons for us as
  we embark on a reform agenda.
  
  The first can be found in the fact that such a report was necessary at
  all. It was because UK law uses fetal viability as the dividing line
  between pregnancies women are allowed to terminate without too much
  interference and red-tape, and those they must beg and plead - or be at
  death’s door - to obtain.
  
  But the age at which fetuses are viable is a moveable feast. Data from
  different countries, even different medical centres in the same state,
  reveal a range of time periods in which infants survive pre-term birth,
  without and without impairment. Using viability to define the rules for
  lawful abortion means that every time there is a blip in this data, or
  someone develops a new machine that goes ping, pro-life forces have
  reason to demand the law be reviewed. The mess and fuss surrounding the
  British report offers a timely reminder to Victorian politicians that if
  they don’t want zealous constituents knocking on their law every few
  years demanding the issue be revisisted, the foundations of any dividing
  line they choose - if one must be chosen at all - must have firm
  foundations.
  
  But the main focus of the Committee’s report was disclosure, with the
  never-before-targeted object of their demands the inquiry’s own
  witnesses.
  
  At Australian government hearings - at least those I’ve attended - what
  is learned in the hearing room about the links and affiliations of
  “expert” witnesses stays in the hearing room. In the final report, only
  the credentials that those giving evidence want revealed are disclosed
  to the public.
  
  But the UK Committee, concerned that some of the submissions they had
  received were from doctors opining on evidence in areas outside their
  expertise, demanded full disclosure of relevant interests, including
  previous publication of strong views on abortion, or membership of
  organizations campaigning on the issue. Such disclosures, it noted, were
  not only in line with its own recommendations on evidence-based policy
  making but in keeping with “accepted practice in the scientific
  community”.
  
  All hell broke loose. Some pro-lifers did come clean (Australia’s own
  John Fleming, who in Australian debates on abortion tends to describe
  himself as Dr Fleming from the Southern Cross Bioethics Institute, added
  that he was a Catholic Priest and President of Campion College, linked
  with Christendom College, whose mission is to make Christ’s teachings
  the law of the land). But others simply refused, claiming to fear that
  the truth would see their views discounted.
  
  Transparency issues were central to the Committee’s concerns at other
  points, too. The Committee stressed the obligation of doctor’s claiming
  to conscientiously object to abortion to alert patients to this fact. It
  also argued for a government obligation to protect women from being
  misled by pro-life counselling agencies either by requiring such
  agencies to present women with health information approved by the Royal
  College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, or to make clear in their
  advertising that they did not support referral for abortion. In
  Australia, a similar outcome could be achieved if Federal Labor
  supported the cross-party Pregnancy Counselling (Truth in Advertising)
  Bill 2006, which prohibits pregnancy counselling agencies from engaging
  in deceptive and misleading advertising.
  
  At the heart of concerns about transparency are those about autonomy,
  the Greek roots of which mean self-rule. To rule our lives we need full
  and accurate information on which to base our decisions. Full disclosure
  may reveal moral or fiscal conflicts of interest change our decisions
  about how much weight to give to the opinions of those claiming to know.
  If we are ignorant of any of the elevant facts about those seeking to
  influence us, the integrity of our decisions is undermined and the grip
  on our lives weakened. Because it may have been if we had known the
  whole truth about the person whose words swayed us, we might not have
  given them so much weight - and so chosen differently - after all.
  
  The Victorian government would be wise to attend to the evidence-based
  findings of the Science and Technology Committee with regard to
  viability and transparency when it reforms our law later this year. And
  all governments must follow the UK lead and demand both advertisers and
  witnesses are fully frank about who they are and where they come from.
  
  If they do, stable, evidence-based laws and policy that treat women as
  fully human shall be our reward.

  Talk about giving with one hand and taking with the other! There, in
  Parliament House, with members of the Stolen Generations looking on and
  thousands more bearing witness via video link on the adjacent lawns. One
  man, representing the nation, validating the painful experiences of
  Aboriginal Australians and by so doing, reminding us of what we as
  Australians have the potential to be. The other - his literal shadow -
  excusing, justifying, insisting on his version of the truth and in so
  doing, painfully reminding us why progress on race relations in this
  country have been stalled for so long.
  
  The trick of oppression is to dehumanise the victim. When a dehumanised
  group is made “other,” using, abusing or even killing its members
  doesn’t seem so wrong. The Nazis described Jews as rats and, when
  discussing the numbers on trains heading for Auschwitz, as rags. Even
  today, Blacks still suffer the occasional insult - commonplace in years
  gone by - of being likened to animals.
  
  Dehumanisation, argues Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela, a former member of South
  Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, is one of the main causes
  of the trauma suffered by the oppressed.
  
  She illustrates this claim with the story of a black South African man
  whose wife was killed by the Pan Africanist Congress while they sat
  side-by-side in church. “My wife was wearing a long blue coat,” the man
  sobbed when finally coming face to face with the killers during South
  Africa’s truth and reconciliation process. “Please tell me, do you
  remember shooting my wife?”
  
  The reality, of course, was that in a church of one thousand people,
  there was little chance that the killers remembered any one of their
  victims. But for this man, for all victims, it was precisely the
  invisibility and interchangeability of their loved one in the eyes of
  the perpetrator that hurt so much. Forgiving, and the healing that can
  come after, requires the wrong-doers - or those representing them - to
  allow their victim a face.
  
  How is this done? Firstly, victims must be allowed to tell their
  stories. This allows the trauma to be integrated into the victim’s life
  narrative and prevents her blaming herself or imagining she made the
  whole thing up. But listening is not enough. The victim must truly be
  heard and trusted. I hear you, I believe you, I acknowledge your pain, I
  am so sorry what was done by me, or in my name. Each of these steps,
  taken when wrong-doers or those who represent them listen to their
  victims and reply only with “I’m sorry” give victims back their
  humanity, replacing trauma and the cross-generational trail of substance
  abuse and social disfunction that flows in its wake with the forgiveness
  that is the first step to healing.
  
  It was this that the Prime Minister stood on Wednesday on the floor of
  the House to offer Aboriginal Australians: recognition of their full
  humanity. And it was this humanity that his shadow - representing an
  opposition that still finds it too much skin off their nose to simply
  shut up and listen and still insists that their conceptualisation of the
  causes of other people’s pain merits centre stage - challenged once
  more.
  
  It is to the credit of Indigenous Australians that they refused to let
  the Opposition’s emotional tighfistedness and smallness of spirit
  diminish or distract from their day. But morally speaking, what Nelson
  said and did, was a shame.
  
  A sorry, sorry shame.

  I don’t like her, and it ain’t the hair. It’s the annoyingly wooden
  affect, and her obeisance over the years to the demands of the American
  public that she change her name and hair, but stand by her man. But when
  I mailed in my absentee ballot for the Democratic primaries several
  months ago (I’m an American citizen as well as an Australian one) the
  tic was next to Hilary Clinton’s name, not Barrack Obama’s.
  
  My reason? Simple. She’s a woman and so am I. While Obama (and I admit
  it’s part of his charm) is a man.
  
  But is voting for another woman - to make partner, win a seat on a board
  or lead the free world - the right thing to do? I say yes, for now at
  least, while women remain so woefully under-represented at all levels of
  power.
  
  Voting patterns in the US Democratic primaries suggest that while 90 per
  cent of Black Americans - male and female - have supported Obama,
  Clinton’s support among White women struggles at times to top 50 per
  cent. White men have been backing other men since the contest began and
  now, with only one bloke left standing, are tending towards Obama.
  
  In other words, while men vote for men and Blacks for Blacks, American
  women are taking the high road and voting for the one they believe -
  regardless of skin colour or pant tackle - will do the best job. And
  while I’ve yet to hear any condemnation of Black Americans for voting as
  a bloc to put one of their own into the Oval Office, a startling number
  of women are scrambling over themselves to show they’d never be so base.
  Influential talk-show host Oprah Winfrey, for instance, was recently
  quoted as saying she would “never vote for anyone based on gender or
  race. I’m voting for Barack Obama…because he is brilliant”. Australian
  columnist Anita Quiqley has expressed similar indignation that anyone
  should think she’d be partial to a politician of her own sex.
  
  The upshot of all this is not hard to predict. Men l - despite
  hand-on-heart protestations of gender-blindness - will continue to help
  other men into office and, if predications of a Democrat victory in the
  2008 election prove correct, Americans may soon have their first Black
  president.
  
  And women? Well, we’ll just keep tending our small patch of
  not-all-that-much and living on borrowed glory. Because without the
  support of other women Hilary, like those who came before her seeking
  high office, will return home empty-handed.
  
  If we really lived in a gender-blind, equal opportunity world, women’s
  scanty representation at the top would be easy to explain. It would be
  because we lacked ambition, or the right stuff. That most of us, most of
  the time, fail to measure up.
  
  But US voting patterns are only the most recent in a long line of
  evidence that the world as we know it - in this way and a number of
  others - isn’t fair. To change it, we need to be among those who are in
  charge. And to do that, we need to back ourselves.
  
  And that’s why, for now, I think it’s OK for women to vote for women for
  no other reason than that they are women. After all, if we don’t when
  other marginalized groups do, we’ll be the only ones coming up chumps.
  
  And because if we can’t bring ourselves to back ourselves, why should
  any one else?

  Some moral questions reduce to empirical ones. Where you stand and what
  you’ll stand up for turns entirely on the facts.
  
  Have the NSW and Victorian governments done the right thing by lifting
  the moratorium on the commercial cultivation of genetically modified
  crops, starting with canola? Both governments have sold the decision as
  one about choice. Lifting the ban allows farmers to choose to plant, and
  consumers to choose to eat or wear, GM crops.
  
  But in the same way that the freedom to swing my fist ends where the tip
  of your nose begins, the rights of those wanting to cultivate and
  consume GM terminate at the point where this choice stops me making a
  different one. And this takes us to the factual question of whether
  anti-GM groups are right that cultivating these crops is the beginning
  of the end of non-GM agriculture, or whether the proponents of GM are
  correct to insist that segregation and coexistence are possible.
  
  My reading of the evidence compiled in the two expert reviews
  commissioned to review the ban - both of which recommended lifting it -
  concede that contamination by GM crops of non-GM foods, organic and
  conventional, is inevitable.
  
  For conventional crops, even effective supply chain management will see
  non-GM food contaminated by the “low level presence” of GM materials
  that grain industry standards allow.
  
  A similar level of contamination is also seen as inevitable in organic
  produce but, unlike the grain industry, the organic one has zero
  tolerance for GM. To be certified organic, produce must have no GM at
  all. To solve this problem, the review panel suggests that current
  definitions of organic be softened, as has been done in Europe. “In the
  European Union, agriculture ministers have agreed to amend the
  regulation of organic food to allow a non-zero threshold (.9 per cent)
  for the unintentional presence of approved GM material in certified
  organic products”.
  
  The proffering of such solutions to the risks of contamination, rather
  than a strict liability regime that would hold the GM farmer and seed
  supplier responsible for all losses incurred as a consequence of
  contamination, reflects the positive disposition of experts handpicked
  by government to conduct the review had towards the technology from the
  start. It’s politics, and that’s the way things go.
  
  But when the NSW review expresses the view that contamination of non-GM
  crops by GM is not “catastrophic,” and a member of the Victorian review
  panel says in an interview that field contamination of
  conventionally-grown canola with the GM is nothing to worry about
  because “there is no danger or disadvantages to GM canola,” it’s hard to
  trust that the recommendations made by the reviews have to manage the
  introduction of the technology into Australia have the protection of
  non-GM enthusiasts forefront in their minds.
  
  The thing about food is just that: it’s food. We baste and sprinkle and
  flamb&eacute; it, but in the end food must be honoured as a gift from
  the planet essential t our survival. For some, the preciousness of food
  leads to the adoption of the precautionary principle when it comes to
  GM: a nay-saying born of a fear that the indeterminate risks of the
  technology to human health and welfare could be so high, we need to turn
  away.
  
  But we don’t need to say, no. We just need to ensure governments stay
  true to their word that in the brave new world of GM food, we’ll all
  have a choice.

  The real test of our principles is when those with whom we disagree
  stand on them to justify doing something we hate.
  
  Polling tells us that the vast majority of Australians support a woman’s
  right to choose. It also shows that most of us want the Federal
  Government to act to stop Japanese whaling in Australia’s self-declared
  whale sanctuary in the waters of Antarctica.
  
  Most of us are repelled by placard-carrying pro-lifers who yell at women
  or impede their access to abortion clinics, and have heaps of sympathy
  for the Sea Shepherd crew, whose recent actions include illegally
  boarding the Japanese whaler the Nisshin Maru to covertly tag it with a
  tracking device, sabotaging the ship’s propeller and pelting the deck
  with rotten butter. But the truth is that both sets of protesters are
  doing similar things, and whatever limits we place on one, need also
  apply to the other.
  
  To know what rules should apply, we first need to understand that the
  agendas of both protest groups are political, not matters of individual
  conscience. Objecting to something you find repugnant on the grounds of
  conscience is called conscientious objection, and is an individual right
  that any society dedicated to protecting the right of its citizens to
  self-rule must defend.
  
  But the actions of pro-life clinic blockaders and radical
  environmentalists are not directed at liberating their consciences.
  “Footpath counsellers” are not medical professionals being compelled to
  participate in contraceptive counselling or abortion, and the crew of
  the Steve Irwin are not mariners who’ve been forced to whale. The
  problem for both groups is not that they are being compelled to do
  something they don’t believe in, but that something they don’t believe
  in is being allowed to happen at all.
  
  There is nothing wrong with standing up to be counted when you believe
  law or policy or practice is wrong. There is nothing wrong with saying
  so in a way designed to highlight the injustice you perceive and - by
  changing public sentiment - making things different. You can even break
  the law to achieve these aims. In fact, breaking the law is what civil
  disobedience is all about.
  
  But with rights come duties. Civil disobedience has high rates of
  collateral damage. It can obstruct the right of fellow citizens to act
  on their consciences, and stop them from getting on with the lawful
  activities that make up their day. So civil dissenters are obliged to do
  two things. The first is to break the law in the light of day. The
  second is to expect and accept punishment.
  
  The upshot? That pro-lifers blockading clinics need to ensure that the
  full range of their “counselling” services are on show when the media or
  police come calling. And if the crew of the Sea Shepherd is ultimately
  found to have broken one or more maritime laws in defence of the whales,
  they are obliged to front up at the required jurisdictional port for
  their day in court.
  
  Such conclusions hurt. Particularly for those, like me, who are
  passionate about women’s reproductive freedom and the well-being of
  whales.
  
  But morally speaking, what is good for the goose must be good for the
  gander. Hypocrisy is a moral crime in nearly every ethical system
  because everyone knows this: that the mark of a truly ethical person is
  not their willingness to stand on principle when the consequences of
  doing so suit them, but their insistence on doing so when they don’t.

  Last week in New Zealand, Ivy May Ngahooro became the third body
  snatched after disputes about burial between non-indigenous and Maori
  relatives. The distress of Ms Ngahooro’s family was extensively covered
  in the New Zealand press, with the will’s executor, niece Trish Scoble,
  saying that the loss of the body made her feel both “sick” and
  “frightened”. Scoble said that she would not stop until her Auntie May
  was laid to rest as she had wanted.
  
  The body snatching cases raises interesting legal issues. One is that
  because New Zealand (like Australia) does not recognize bodies as
  property, the unauthorized removal of Ngahooro’s remains did not
  constitute theft or justify police intervention (though lawmakers in New
  Zealand now appear ready to change this).
  
  The moral issues are just as compelling. For some, the Auntie May case
  was a storm in a teacup. Who cared where the woman was buried? Auntie
  May wouldn’t because she was dead.
  
  But is it really that simple? Can we simply disregard the wishes of the
  deceased? Or are there things we owe to the dead?
  
  Many moral thinkers, including Aristotle and Confucius, believed we did
  have obligations to the dead. Every time we refuse to speak ill of them
  or work to carry out their last wishes or insist they get justice when
  their demise was the result of foul play, we strenuously agree.
  
  But while we know that it would be wrong to override Dad’s request to be
  an organ donor or for staff at the morgue to violate Mum’s body, it’s
  hard to explain why. After all, being dead, neither Dad nor Mum are
  likely to care.
  
  But the end of a body doesn’t mean the end of a relationship. Just
  because my mother’s dead doesn’t mean she’s not my mother. So while the
  relationship demands of the dead are few, what demands there are can be
  said to create obligations in the living.
  
  In the same way that relationships carry forward beyond death, so too do
  the interests of the dead person. It’s not hard to see why dead people
  would maintain an interest in the fate of their body and organs, and the
  protection of their memory, legacy and reputation. The law recognizes
  these things by enforcing the terms of the deceased’s will.
  
  The fact that the dead won’t know of our failure to protect their
  interests doesn’t mean those interests don’t exist, and our failure
  doesn’t count. If you pledge fidelity to your partner when you marry,
  then sleeping with someone else make you a cheat and causes your partner
  hurt, even if they never find out. And if you don’t scatter Dad’s ashes
  in the Blue Mountains like he asked, the fact that he’ll never know
  doesn’t mean he wasn’t harmed when you let him down.
  
  The upshot? That even if the dead don’t know we’ve harmed them, they
  have legitimate interests that can be harmed. These interests are ones
  those of us bound by relationship to the dead are obligated to defend.
  
  Of course, many of the laws and customs surrounding death protect the
  interests and wellbeing of the living, too. For instance, restrictions
  on savaging the dead protect those who loved them from the helpless hurt
  of watching their memory and legacy tarnished.
  
  But our obligations to the dead are stand-alone, too. Things we must do
  because despite the loss of their bodies, the dead are still people,
  too.

  The facts are simple. Elliot Spitzer, who fought organised crime and
  corruption on Wall Street, resigned last week as New York’s Governor
  after Federal wiretaps caught him arranging to meet an out-of-town
  hooker in his DC hotel.
  
  It was the Mann Act of 1910 that brought Spitzer down. In its current
  incarnation - the US Congress amended it in 1978 and again in 1986 - the
  statute prohibits the transportation of people across state lines for
  the purpose of prostitution.
  
  Out of a job, his chance at a future run at the Presidency dashed, and
  facing 20 years jail if convicted, you have to ask: what was the man
  thinking? I’m not sure, though one thing he did make clear during the
  press conferences clocking his demise was that the answer was none of
  our business. His behaviour was a “private matter,” and his “failings”
  were private, too.
  
  I couldn’t agree more. If Spitzer says - which he does - that he failed
  his Harvard-trained attorney wife Silda, his children and his entire
  family by sleeping with a prostitute, who am I to disagree? But I once
  lived and worked in New York and if I still did, I wouldn’t think for a
  moment that he had failed me.
  
  I would feel the same about an Australian politician in Spitzer’s shoes,
  though in New South Wales and Victoria it would be unlikely that such an
  official would ever be charged. Indoor commercial sex was decriminalised
  n NSW, and partially legalised in Victoria, years ago. Among the reasons
  why is the distaste small-l liberals feel for the state sticking its
  beak into people’s private affairs. What two consenting adults get up to
  in bed is no one’s business but their own.
  
  Those on board - or should I say in bed? - with this philosophy may feel
  that Spitzer’s exit from public life is a shame, given all he had given
  to it. So he had sex with a prostitute. How exactly does this impact on
  his ability to do his job?
  
  Americans may be wondering about this, too. Throughout the semen stains,
  cigar speculations and impeachment proceedings that constituted the
  Lewinsky affair, roughly 75% told pollsters they thought Bill Clinton
  was fit to govern, and should remain as President.
  
  But isn’t it wrong for those meant to uphold the law to break it?
  Absolutely. Doesn’t Spitzer’s behaviour show a failure of judgment or an
  arrogant belief that he wouldn’t be caught? Yep. Doesn’t his zealous
  pursuit of those running brothels - in the US and abroad - make him a
  hypocrite? Possibly, though he only prosecuted operators, never “johns.”
  What about Spitzer’s repeated use of the name of a friend and donor -
  George Fox - to book the hotel room? Ai Carumba! With friends like that,
  who needs enemies?
  
  But to assertions that Spitzer’s behaviour goes to character, I need to
  ask, whose? In Australia, 19% of men have paid for sex at some point,
  with reasons and situations varying. To my mind, it’s those who cast
  aspersions on all these men’s’ characters without knowing a thing abut
  them or their situation - some cancer-stricken wives give their husbands
  their blessing - who have character questions to answer.
  
  Spitzer broke the law and for this he will rightly be made to pay. But
  his story reminds us why laws that make commercial sex behind closed
  doors between consenting adults a crime really need to change.

  Imagine this. You’ve spent your childhood with a brother bound to a
  wheelchair by a disease that causes him immense suffering. The condition
  has haunted your family for generations, killing male children and
  putting the female ones at risk of passing the faulty chromosome on to
  their own kids.
  
  The disease is haeomophilia, a disease of the blood that, while
  treatable, causes a lifetime of pain and disability.
  
  The good news is that, while no cure exists, there is technology that
  can help. Bypassing the pleasure and privacy of sex, you can conceive
  using IVF. Scientists will “diagnose” the sex of your embryos, discard
  the affected males and implant a female. Nine months later a healthy
  girl will be born.
  
  Or not. Last week Victorian couple Fiona and Paul took action in the
  Supreme Court against Melbourne IVF, Ballarat Health Services, their
  obstetrician and Bendigo Radiology for failing to tell them that, in
  spite of all their pre-implantation efforts, Fiona was gestating a boy.
  Had they known, the couple says they would have considered termination
  and their son Jesse, who came into the world with a severe form of
  haemophilia, may never have been born.
  
  The success of the couple’s case will turn on the particulars of their
  situation, but recent Australian court decisions on “wrongful births”
  have favoured the parents. In 2003, the High Court upheld a lower
  court’s decision to compensate Kerry Anne and Craig Melchior for a
  healthy boy, Jordan, who would not have been born but for Kerry Anne’s
  doctor botching her sterilization.
  
  The logic of the pro-compensation camp is compelling. Contraception and
  pre-natal screening are designed to prevent the birth of a particular
  child - one affected by disease - or any child at all. Society cannot
  allow parents to avoid the birth of children they say they cannot
  parent, but then deny them compensation when their prevention efforts
  fail through no fault of their own.
  
  Despite this, such cases perplex and confound. We all know that
  conferring immunity on incompetent doctors is a recipe for health-care
  disaster, yet feel sick at the thought of a child discovering later in
  life - perhaps in excruciating detail - how much his parents wished he’d
  not been born.
  
  But what we need to keep in mind is that the way parents like Fiona and
  Paul feel about a child they haven’t yet conceived, or a very early
  embryo in vivo or vitro, is very different to the emotions provoked by a
  newborn lying in their arms. Indeed, it is this difference that leads
  them to try and avoid a very sick child being born in the first place.
  Because they know that once that child arrives, sick or not, they will
  love him, and suffer with him. Indeed, it is to avoid this - the loving
  of a sick and suffering child - that they sought in good faith to avoid,
  and for this child that they sue, not for themselves. Because while
  money is good for hospital bills and respite care, it won’t touch the
  guilt and heartache born every day by the parents of a chronically sick
  kid.
  
  Understanding this ends the mystery of why nearly all pregnant women who
  can’t parent choose adoption over abortion. Because abortion lets them
  halt the development of something that, if born, they would love and
  feel they could never give away to another. Their child.

  It’s always about the money. Or is it?
  
  When a marriage ends, insults fly, but most of the time the real
  knock-down drag-outs are about cash, even when there’s more than enough
  to go around.
  
  Some might say this is to be expected. After all, money is what married
  couples argue about most. Why would things be different when they split?
  
  Before I answer this, I need to confess. I am the child of divorce. My
  parents finally divorced after 11 years of unhappy matrimony
  interspersed with several failed separations. They moved from disputes
  about custody to brawls about money that only ended (or I think they
  did, anyway) when I left home. I’ve also been divorced myself and, like
  most of us, witnessed numerous family members and friends follow a
  similar path.
  
  In other words, the view I am about to impart is - for better or for
  worse -home-grown.
  
  And it is this. When estranged partners argue over money, they are
  really talking about emotions. Disputes about the sums to be inserted
  into property settlement formulas - how much each partner brought to the
  marriage and who contributed what to the value of assets accumulated
  during the marriage - are really about far more than cash.
  
  Why is this so? Whether right or wrong, most of us see divorce as a
  failure and with failure comes disappointment, grief and anger.
  Especially in the early stages, emotions run high as each partner tries
  to work out what went wrong and the role they played in the break-up.
  Part of this process seems to be an accounting for the way that the
  personality and emotional baggage the other person brought to the
  relationship, and his or her emotional failures during its duration,
  contributed to the marriage’s demise.
  
  See the parallel? No wonder that money, a measure of value we all
  understand, becomes a proxy for tallying up all the other person failed
  to give us, and all that failure cost us, in emotional terms. A proxy
  for summing up the responsibility each bears for the dissolution of the
  partnership and consequently, how much each owes, and must be made to
  pay.
  
  The money-as-emotional-proxy theory throws light on why sometimes, even
  after the settlement is done, couples rage on. Think of Denise Richards
  and Charlie Sheen. It also explains why couples would risk the damage to
  their children and reputations caused by settling the issue in court -
  instead of privately - despite the fact that the amount one party
  rejects as an insult is generous enough for the interest to support a
  family for life in the lap of luxury. Paul McCartney was rumoured to
  have offered Heather Mills 10 million to settle out of court.
  
  But it’s the principle of the thing, I can hear you say. Yes, I agree,
  and that is precisely my point. That when divorce happens, battles over
  money are about points of principle, or designed to settle emotional
  scores or exact revenge or - at a time when self-esteem is low - prove
  one’s worth. But that is not how it should be.
  
  Perhaps instead, estranged couples could look up from the shriek-fest
  about the provenance of a pile of CDs or a clothes dryer and recognise
  that whether they win or lose that particular battle, the heartache they
  feel over their defeat in the war for happy-ever-after will still be
  there.
  
  And lay down their arms. Especially if there are children listening in.

  You may not have heard of it, but my guess is, you will soon. Climate
  engineering-or global climate control-may soon be a fact of life.
  
  First, the good news. You know how the Stern Report said we’ve only got
  eight to eighteen years left to significantly reduce global emissions or
  risk costly and irreversible damage to the planet? And how, despite
  this, global leaders continue to do bugger-all to fix the problem? To do
  so little, in fact, that most of us have concluded that either they are
  booked on a well-furnished galactic space station that the rest of us
  don’t know about or, even more depressingly, that what is collectively
  required of us to save the planet is beyond our capacity to achieve?
  
  Well, turns out that despite this tragic state of affairs, we-or our
  children or grandchildren-may not have to die. Because there is a Plan
  C.
  
  Plan B requires governments to develop and commercialise carbon-neutral
  energy and energy conservation technologies. A good idea but, like Plan
  A, still awaiting action on the policy front.
  
  Enter Plan C: climate engineering. Whether it’s chucking
  light-refracting sulphur particles into the stratosphere or using soot
  to create mini “nuclear winters,” we’re talking technology designed to
  fix what technology has wrought. Currently, such plans are
  under-developed: a mix of educated speculation and back-of-the-envelope
  calculations. But if they work, they’ll be cheap and quick to deploy.
  
  So why have scientists, across these basic facts for at least fifteen
  years, not begin seriously discussing them until last year?
  
  Because they thought they shouldn’t.
  
  In an extraordinary and perhaps unprecedented act of self-censorship,
  they seem to have kept mum-shelving papers, shunning mavericks~~-
  because they believed that if political leaders knew there was a
  get-out-of-climate-change-free card in the offing, they‘d never make the
  hard choices necessary to deal with the problem "properly’~~-by reducing
  emissions.
  
  But here’s the question: is such self-censorship the commendable action
  of a bunch of blokes (and yes, they are all blokes) to protect the
  public good, or an unjustified act of paternalism? And what do we think
  of the fact that at least some scientists kept mum because they believed
  that because a technological fix was relatively easy, it was necessarily
  bad?
  
  If climate engineering is bad~~~~enabling us to sow carbon without
  reaping its negative consequences~~~~than self-censorsing was the
  honourable thing to do. It may even have been required given the
  Universal Ethical Code’s demand that scientists “minimise and justify”
  any adverse effect their work may have on living creatures and the
  environment.
  
  On the other hand, if we think that a techno-fix is a bloody good idea,
  then the delay self-censorship may have caused to the commencement of
  the small reversible studies that will tell us whether the technology
  will work, and about its side effects, is unconscionable.
  
  I’ll be frank. People who oppose technology because it might allow us to
  escape some of the suffering we deserve for all the evil we have done,
  give me the irrits. Give me development any day, and wouldn’t it be
  grand if the poor folk of the world could enjoy some, too.
  
  Whether they got it right or wrong, the collective silence on climate
  engineering shows how seriously the scientific community takes its moral
  obligations. and that has to be a good thing. And, hey, we may not all
  have to fry!
  
  Sulphur pellets anyone?

  Last year, a girl at my son’s school primary school - let’s call her
  Susan - had a headache. The next day she collapsed and since then has
  been in a wheelchair from spinal damage caused by a benign tumour.
  
  Susan and the other children were told that that she might not walk
  again. Not that she would not, but that she might not. Only gradually
  did it became clear to everyone - the little girl, her friends and the
  parent community - that walking was not on the cards.
  
  Susan’s parents were clear and open about their family’s crisis. They
  posted a child-friendly explanation of what had happened to Susan, and
  follow up “chapters” of her story, in the school newsletter. They
  authorised teachers to talk about Susan in class. This gave permission
  for the children and everyone else to talk about what happened, express
  grief, ask questions and make plans to help.
  
  But in couching Susan’s prognosis in possibilities rather than
  certainties, were the parents guilty of telling a white lie, or even a
  bald-faced one?
  
  Absolutely not. The reality is that adults have trouble levelling with
  kids even - or perhaps especially - when the issue matters. A majority
  of parents of donor-conceived children never tell their children the
  truth about their conception As well, experts report chronic
  difficulties in convincing parents of children facing catastrophic
  illness - those who’ve been born with AIDS, or diagnosed with
  life-threatening cancer - to tell their children the truth about their
  condition and prognosis.
  
  The reasons why include parents being in denial themselves, feeling
  guilty or ashamed, or simply being unsure what to say. But whatever the
  cause, parents put their children at risk by withholding such critical
  information because if the secret gets out - and most secrets do - the
  child may struggle to trust her parents or anyone else again. Parents
  also have no right to deny children critical information about their
  health and lives. They hold such information in trust, but it is the
  moral property of the child.
  
  Of course telling, like lying, can be done badly or well. To tell well,
  parents must be sensitive to the child’s age, temperament and
  resilience.
  
  By presenting their daughter’s diagnosis as a possibility instead of a
  certainty, Susan’s parents offered her and the rest of us the chance to
  explore the scariest of outcomes in a context that offered an emotional
  “out”. This “out” was one I saw my own son take a number of times.
  Briefly contemplating the wheelchair as a permanent fixture in Susan’s
  life, he would suddenly switch off, telling me that we didn’t have to
  think about this too much, because it might not happen. But as the
  months passed, I noticed he could meditate on the idea that Susan might
  not recover for longer and longer periods. This meant that when the
  final prognosis was laid bare, he and the other children were quick to
  accept it and to move on to discussions about helping Susan to return to
  school full-time.
  
  So while it is true that honesty is the best policy, there is an art to
  breaking bad news. What Susan’s parents taught me is this when kids need
  to be told difficult things, adults need to speak plainly and openly,
  and to stage disclosures in ways that give the children time to process
  the information and move through the pain.

  Madonna turns 50 this year. Like every wheeze and fart in the
  entertainer’s life, this one is attracting comment. From some, it sounds
  like this. “50? She looks 30! If she really was a taboo-breaker, she
  wouldn’t have smooth skin and pert breasts. She’d be strutting her stuff
  on the cover of Vanity Fair with a wrinkled d&eacute;colletage and baggy
  arms hanging out.”
  
  Like most discussions about ageing in contemporary Australia, this one
  is confused. On the one hand, baby-boomers can’t stop telling us that 60
  is the new 50, that age-related discrimination is rife, and that no one
  should have to give up what they do or love because others say they’re
  too old. Stay at work! Keep enjoying sex! Arise and go windsailing!
  Having only just arrived in middle age I can tell you that exhortations
  to keep on keeping on are constant.
  
  But don’t attempt to match your youthful activities with youthful looks,
  or you will be condemned as unenlightened and vain. So what if employers
  discriminate against older workers or that invisibility for women beyond
  a certain age is inevitable? Resistance by Botox or surgery is wrong,
  wrong, wrong. The upshot? We’re forbidden to act our age but required to
  look it. Where’s the sense in that?
  
  Which takes us back to the material girl. Yes, it would it have been
  radical for the bare arms emerging from Madonna’s body suit to have been
  dotted with hair-sprouting moles. Radical for cascading waves of
  cellulite to have been visible above her thigh-high black boots.
  
  But does anyone really think this would have made middle age “hot”? My
  guess is that such an appearance would have started a whisper campaign
  that would have brought Madonna’s long-running reign as a cultural icon
  to a close. Poor Madonna, look at how old she looks. Poor Madonna, she’s
  let herself go. Poor Madonna, can’t she see she’s not beautiful any
  more, and so no longer entitled to the power beautiful women wield?
  
  Pitying Madonna. It gives me shivers to think about it.
  
  No wonder she has refused to age gracefully. No wonder she resists not
  just in ways we approve (eating well, spending hours in the gym and at
  dance rehearsals) but in ways we don’t (liquid and surgical lifts,
  tucks, peels and slathers). Resists received opinion about right and
  wrong, and the endless rules about how women should live their lives,
  just as she has always done.
  
  So why are we so quick to judge? Madonna is reticent about her fitness
  and other age-retarding routines. She never promotes them as liberatory
  or feminist in any sense.
  
  I think it’s envy and a desperate sense that we can’t keep up. Madonna
  at 50 looks better than most of us at 30, and this makes some of us feel
  like failures. We could console ourselves with the fact she has a home
  gym, a personal trainer, nannies and a travelling chef to support her
  efforts, but instead we point the finger, and accuse her of letting us
  down.
  
  I don’t think she has and suspect that Nora Ephron would agree. Ephron,
  of When Harry met Sally fame, had this to say about ageing in a recent
  essay in American Vogue: “[Some people say] it’s great to be old. It’s
  great to be wise and sage and mellow; it’s great to be at the point
  where you understand just what matters in life. I can’t stand people who
  say things like this.”

  My speciality area of ethics is reproductive technologies. What this
  means is that I spend much of my working life face-to-face with the
  suspicions that religious men, political leaders and journalists have
  about female morality.
  
  At a meeting I attended, the capacity of women to make ethically
  defensible choices about using pre-natal screening tests was openly
  doubted. I was sent a copy of a pastoral letter signed by 7 male bishops
  supporting ongoing penal sanctions against women who have abortions on
  the grounds that they are guilty of a “grave moral disorder.” When an
  insurance giant offered cover to women for pregnancy complications or a
  child born with a birth defect, I was invited to reply to claims that
  older mothers had brought the problem on themselves by delaying
  childbirth.
  
  And that was just this week.
  
  Doubts about women’s moral agency date back to the Greeks. Plato argued
  that “women’s nature is inferior to that of men in capacity for virtue”
  and so more inclined to “secrecy and stealth.” More than 2000 years
  later, Freud argued that women’s psychosexual development meant that
  women “show less sense of justice than men.” In the late 1950s, a
  soon-to-be influential moral psychologist named Lawrence Kohlberg
  developed a six stage model of moral development that suggested it was
  no accident that the Gandi’s and Martin Luther King’s of the world were
  men. Women, because of an overemphasis on maintaining relationships,
  failed to progress to the highest stages of judgement where
  relationships were subordinated to rules and, ultimately, to universal
  principles of justice.
  
  But here’s the problem. The empirical evidence not only fails to support
  the “men are more moral” thesis, but suggests the truth is the other way
  around. A recent study of the giving habits of Americans found that
  women not only make more charitable contributions than men, they are far
  less likely than men to give because they can earn a tax deduction. Or
  the findings of a study presented at a recent International Studies
  Association conference that the higher the percentage of women in
  legislatures, the more likely states were to use foreign aid, not
  military spending or conflict escalation, to achieve their aims. We also
  know that when it comes to education, women in the developing world are
  the target for intervention because, as Greg Mortenson, the American who
  has dedicated his life to building schools for girls in impoverished
  areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan puts it, “If you educate a boy, you
  educate an individual. If you educate a girl, you educate a community.”
  The same goes for development aid that focuses on women because, says
  the Equilibrium Fund, “improving conditions for women results in
  improved conditions for the entire family.”
  
  Does this mean every woman is a saint, and more saintly than a man? Of
  course not, but what it does suggest is that if you had to pick winners,
  you’d pick a woman every time.
  
  But raising the moral superiority of women is a double-edged sword.
  Author Julia Baird says that the “assumption…that women are cleaner,
  more ethical than men…has been their greatest burden.” The higher the
  pedestal, the harder the fall—just ask Carmen Lawrence and Cheryl
  Kernot.
  
  So perhaps we can agree to this. Men can stop insulting women’s imagined
  moral failings, and women will agree to keep mum about men’s real ones.

  What does independent research, shield laws and whistleblower
  legislation have in common, and why should we give a rats?
  
  Answer? All are essential for the creation and dissemination of the
  quality information on which good decision-making - not to mention the
  proper functioning of our democracy - depends.
  
  Take the de-funding of universities. The insistence on successive
  Australian governments on underfunding higher education has forced some
  university researchers to rely on Big Pharma dollars. But the data from
  industry-funded research is flawed for reasons that include a preference
  for evaluations of patient outcomes in the short-term (they cost less)
  and the reluctance of drug companies to publish results that show their
  products don’t work at all, work less well than cheaper alternatives or
  have worrying side effects.
  
  This week’s police raid on the offices of the Sunday Times was another
  assault on our right to know. Designed to unearth the source of a story
  that embarrassed the Carpenter government, it followed last year’s
  conviction of two journalists for contempt of court because they refused
  to reveal a source, and the handing of a suspended sentence to a public
  servant found guilty of leaking a report to the media that revealed
  dangerous security breeches at Sydney airport. Perhaps this is why
  Reporters without Borders recently ranked Australia 35th, equal with
  Bulgaria but behind Bolivia and South Korea, on the press freedom index.
  
  Attack on independent research, the free press and whistleblowers
  violates the right of Australian citizens, and government
  decision-makers, to access the independent, fulsome and reliable
  information they need to make good decisions for themselves, their
  families and the nation. Yet too often, the public dismisses calls by
  academics for independent funding, and the demands of journalists for
  shield and whistle-blower laws, as self-serving. Either that, or they
  yawn.
  
  But we need to get it. We need to understand that however abstract,
  airy-fairy or hoity-toity concerns about independent research, press
  freedom and whistleblowing sound, their absence is hurting each one of
  us: putting our health at risk; undermining our democracy.
  
  Did you know that the Australian government is now forced to rely on the
  drug industry’s clinical trials to decide what medicines to subsidise
  under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme? Think about it - your tax
  dollars currently subsidise medicines that may be unnecessary,
  ineffective or even dangerous.
  
  Did you realize that when you open the newspaper each day there are
  stories you won’t see because your friends, neighbours or colleagues
  decided not to leak the information that would have informed you of a
  dangerous incompetence or venal fraud in some key institution? That at
  least one of the reasons they may have kept mum was a fear - in the
  absence of comprehensive national whistleblower legislation - of being
  publicly vilified, sacked or taken to court?
  
  How can we keep our commercial and public sectors free of corruption, if
  decision-makers know their immorality and errors will go with them to
  their graves? Corrupt public institutions strike at the heart of
  democracy itself, by undermining the rule of law, and replacing it with
  the rule of powerful men, while a free press is essential to a
  functioning democracy..
  
  So next time you hear some academic thumping their chest about a loss of
  funding, or a journalist bemoaning some restrictive government law or
  practice, don’t tune out. What we don’t know can hurt us all.

  The government has ordered yet another inquiry into a paid leave scheme
  for working Australian parents. This one, by the Productivity
  Commission, follows two similar ones by HREOC and a Senate Committee in
  2002. What is left to examine, for heaven’s sake! It’s a leave scheme,
  not the first signs of life on Mars.
  
  But PM Rudd may be more likely than his predecessors to stop yakking
  about parental leave, and actually do the deed. When he does, the most
  important decision he’ll make is who will be granted leave.
  
  Let’s pray it won’t just be mothers. Because dads need leave, too.
  
  The best idea is the allocation of 18 months of paid leave for parents
  to use as they please over the first five years of the child’s life,
  with one condition. Five months must either be taken by Dads, or
  sacrificed (a provision the Nordic countries have used successfully to
  help men resist being bullied out of time with their infant by a macho,
  all-hours work culture).
  
  But those in favour of parental leave may need to fight to be heard.
  Politicians, commentators and even feminists have been talking about
  maternity leave for so long that the placement of the word “father” next
  to “infant” has developed radical connotations. Said the Government of
  the latest inquiry: “We want to explore ways to make it as easy as
  possible for working mums to balance their employment with the important
  job of raising a new generation of Australians.”
  
  In part, the reactionary gloss on debates about paid leave-a policy that
  has long been central to the progressive goal of achieving equality
  between the sexes-is a legacy of the Howard years.
  
  We all know what John Howard thought about working mothers (those who
  were married, anyway. The single ones he condemned as dole-bludgers). In
  a desperate attempt to swing the PM their way, feminists inside and
  outside the Liberal party tried to make a national leave scheme a small
  target by arguing that women needed it to be good women: so they could
  breastfeed longer, bond better with their babies and keep their young
  from the devil’s playground called childcare. Said then Sex
  Discrimination Commissioner Pru Goward, “It is very unusual to find
  women in Europe…going back to work with children under the age of 6
  months as you increasingly find in Australia, with all the implications
  that has with breast-feeding, for the recovery of the mother and for the
  development of the child…[it is] a scandal that so many babies are being
  left in care…”
  
  It didn’t work. Worse, it left us with an antediluvian way of talking
  about the kind of leave we want, and why we want it that threatens our
  capacity to win something worth having.
  
  We need to start fresh. From the premise that both Australian men and
  women do work, want to work or need to work and that when they partner,
  most want to have kids. This makes the central policy question: how can
  we help them do both?
  
  Such a gender-neutral frame presumes what most of us know to be true.
  That parents have a responsibility to share the work and pleasure of
  caring and earning. That they need to give their kids the benefits of
  being cared for by both parents and model for their children the
  capacity of both genders to move with ease and independence between home
  and the wider world.
  
  Parental, not maternity, leave is the only moral policy choice.

  What is unforgiveable? Are there some acts that cross the moral line in
  the sand dividing the venal from the inescapably evil? Are there some
  things, and some people, we cannot forgive?
  
  As an ethicist, I am asked this question more than any other. Perhaps
  because the thirst for justice-and vengeance-comes easily to human
  beings, but can be seen to conflict with the Christian imperative to
  forgive.
  
  I have sympathy for those who claim some actions, and the people who
  perpetrate them, are beyond the pale. My personal candidate for Ms
  Unforgiveability is American woman Debra Milke, who conspired with two
  psychopathic drug-addled “friends” to lure her four year old son into
  the desert on the pretence of meeting Santa Claus and catching snakes so
  they colud t execute him, and collect the insurance money. Tussling for
  the crown, of course, are Australians John Bunting and Robert Wagner
  whose hatred of paedophiles and homosexuals saw them torture and
  dismember their innocent victims by crushing toes with pliers and
  applying electric shocks.
  
  As it happens, the creatures involved in these crimes were either
  sentenced to die, or to spend the rest of their lives in jail. A good
  thing in my view, because while unforgiveability may be a helpful moral
  concept, its practical use may be seriously questioned.
  
  The process of setting moral standards is a collective one. When a
  member of our community becomes a victim of a moral crime, it is our
  reaction to the event-the words of our leaders, talk-back radio calls,
  chat around the water-cooler-that either affirms or modifies the
  existing consensus on what Is acceptable behaviour. Whether it’s a child
  raped by the trusted parish Priest, a wife betrayed by a sexual liaison
  between her husband and best friend, or the frail old codger defrauded
  by the down-and-out youth he sought to assist, condemning such acts as
  unforgivable contributes to the collective process of defining who we
  are by what we believe is right and wrong. It is from such definitions,
  and the process we undertake to arrive at them, that our children learn
  our moral code.
  
  But while unforgiveability may be a useful tool for preventing heinous
  moral transgressions in the first place, once citizens have done the
  unspeakable, its practical use-if the unforgiven are destined to one day
  return to society-can be questioned.
  
  Human beings live up, or down, to the expectations others have of them.
  Treat Eliza Doolittle like a crass bit of street scum, and that’s how
  she’ll behave. But my dear Henry Higgins, behold the transformation when
  you treat her like a lady! Our sense of self is formed, and to a large
  degree maintained, through our interactions with others. If our friends
  and neighbours dismiss us as beyond redemption, then we are likely we
  will see ourselves this way, and to behave accordingly. Why try to
  change, to put in the hard yards to unpick patterns of thought and
  behaviour that led one to sin so grievously in the past, when everyone
  you know and live among has written you off? When no matter what you do,
  there is no chance of being forgiven?
  
  So are some acts, and some folk, unforgivable? The answer has to be
  “yes,” though it comes with a warning: the unforgiven are dangerous
  characters to have roaming the streets. So if we can’t find it in our
  hearts to forgive, we would be wise to throw away the key.

  For a friend of mine, adolescence was no time of innocence. It was the
  worst and most confusing time of her life; made all the worse by the
  insistence of the adults she knew that the pain would be useful later.
  
  The main problem was that believed she had lost her father’s love.
  Always such a tactile man, one day he simply refused to touch her. No
  wrestling on the bed. No more hugs. The mere sight of her body seemed to
  cause physical pain. He would wince, and turn away.
  
  In her eighteenth year the rift healed as mysteriously as it had opened.
  Now they are close. But my friend never forgot her father’s sudden and
  mysterious rejection. To forgive him, to have trusting relationships
  with other men, she had to understand what went wrong.
  
  This is what she thinks happened. One day she and her dad were horsing
  around and he got aroused. Dismayed, disturbed and disgusted at such an
  unbidden physical response, he went into repressive overdrive. Rejecting
  the feelings and the person who caused them - her - in one fell swoop.
  No wonder her frantic efforts to discover the nature of her
  transgression so she could make amends for it and return things to
  normal between them, failed. Matters would only improve when she had
  finished growing up.
  
  The hysterical over-reaction to Bill Henson’s photographs of naked
  adolescents, prompted by a complaint to police by Bravehearts’ Hetty
  Johnston, has put me in mind of this story. Johnson has her own demons.
  It is easy to see how her failure to recognise that her father-in-law
  had indecentld assaulted her daughter might make her hyper-vigilant
  about the seemingly innocent motives and behaviour of all men.
  
  But we don’t have to share her suspicions. Instead, we could accept the
  obvious fact that most men are neither pornographers nor paedophiles.
  Secure in this knowledge, we could welcome Bill Henson’s attempt to
  prise open the complexity of adolescence, and the response of adults to
  it. Betwixt and between, neither child nor adult, the adolescent body
  and place in society is ambiguous, uneasy and paradoxical. Beautiful and
  awkward, vulnerable yet powerful, Henson’s photographs invite us to
  consider questions contemporary western societies struggles to ask,
  little less answer. Can the budding bodies and sexuality of adolescents
  be celebrated without being exploited? Can we recognise the
  vulnerability of adolescents, particular girls, without supporting the
  victim mentality that accompanies dis-empowering conceptions of female
  sexuality? Can we allow adolescents to feel proud of their bodies and
  sexuality, or will we - by condemning as pornographic the photographing
  of such bodies - forever insist on shame?
  
  If our response to those who dare raise such questions is to label them
  pornographers and paedophiles, I don’t like our chances.
  
  So the final words of this column are for the young woman featured on
  the invitation to Henson’s exhibit. The one those orchestrating the
  continuing witch hunt against the artist claim to be so concerned about,
  and whose image was among those the Prime Minister labelled,
  “revolting.”
  
  You are beautiful, darling. Be proud. Years from now, you’ll still be
  admired while those responsible for the current stupidity will be long
  gone. Thank you for giving us insight into this complex time in your
  life: into who you are and the strong woman you are becoming. Find it in
  your heart to forgive adults. It is we, not you, who are in the wrong.

  OK, I admit it. I cry easily. My eldest’s grade 6 graduation ceremony
  provoked a flood. Even k.d. lang’s version of Hallelujah can do it. When
  the face of the little fella in the Worksafe Victoria ad lights up
  because his Dad is safe and home, I break down in sobs.
  
  But this week was a first. This week I saw a documentary so moving that
  even now, days later, the thought of it brings tears to my eyes.
  Reviewing the trailer in preparation for writing this column, I broke
  down again. Pushing my keyboard aside I put my head on the desk, and
  bawled.
  
  The Music in Me, presented by that national treasure Andrew Denton,
  features the Merry Makers, a troupe of intellectually and physically
  disabled performers aged six to 56, and the two wonderful women-mother
  and daughter team, Janet and Lucinda, who have dedicated their lives to
  putting these dancers on stage.
  
  When the credits rolled I found myself pondering, tissue-box in lap, why
  the Merry Makes tale is so inspiring. While articulate about all other
  aspects of the troupe, neither Lucinda nor Janet could explain why-in
  Janet’s words-a Merry Makers’ performance “just generates love and joy
  and happiness, and no one wants to go home.”
  
  I think I know. Firstly, is because the Merry Makers replace disgrace
  with pride. The film is unflinching in its exploration of the shame
  parents feel, or are made to feel by others, when a disabled child-one
  with Down’s syndrome or Fragile X or cerebral palsy-is born. “I felt
  sick. My legs went to jelly. This can’t be happening to me, she’s too
  beautiful,” recalls one mother. Another was told by her grandfather, as
  the rest of her assembled family silently examined the new arrival,
  “nothing like this ever happened in our family.”
  
  But the Merry Makers is about celebrating ability, not disability. In
  doing so, it allows the parents of special children to experience what
  the rest of us take for granted: set-piece moments where we are
  permitted to glory and gloat in our children’s accomplishments, and
  accept the admiration of others for what they have achieved.
  
  The climax of The Music in Me is the Merry Makers’ 2005 performance in
  the Sydney Entertainment Centre alongside Marcia Hines, Todd McKenney
  and John Paul Young.
  
  When the Merry Makers take their bows to rapturous applause, you get the
  feeling that this may be the first time in these people’s lives where
  they are the object of honest admiration and praise. When the camera
  follows Merry Makers into the audience where they are hugged and
  congratulated by ecstatic family members, you wonder if this is the
  first time these parents have been given permission to publicly revel in
  their child’s accomplishments.
  
  A Merry Makers performance offers something unique to audiences, too. We
  live in a world designed to make people with disabilities and those who
  care for them invisible. When we do see the disabled and their carers,
  it is usually because something is wrong. Disabled people abused in
  specialized accommodation or carers who lack respite care or are having
  their allowances slashed.
  
  This near-exclusive representation of the disabled in the wider
  community as those in plight, deserving our pity and rescue (and, in the
  event we fail to provide either, our guilt) put paid to the “love, joy
  and happiness” offered by the Merry-Makers.
  
  Feel good, do good. It works for the Merry Makers and, so it seems for
  us, too.

  Their strength is waning, but there is still a depressingly large number
  of powerful men in the west, spread across a range of denominations,
  spewing raw hate and naked prejudice at gay people. All in the name of
  Christ.
  
  We are talking about the sort of hate that gives rise to claim that
  homosexual “inclinations” are an “intrinsic moral evil” that, if acted
  upon, preclude gays from taking communion, occupying any official role
  in the church and, ultimately, entering the Kingdom of God. The sort of
  prejudice that led the Australian Anglican Archbishop to forbid any
  parish in his archdiocese to welcome the openly gay American Bishop Gene
  Robinson, and to declare that if Robinson was invited to a crucial
  meeting of the world’s Anglican bishops in Lambeth, then the Australian
  Archbishop would not be attending.
  
  I am sorry, but someone seems to have had a fundamental misunderstanding
  of the core insights of the Gospels, and it isn’t me. It was precisely
  this sort of attack on social outcasts of Jesus’s time by the powerful
  men of the day-the Temple Priests-that inspired Jesus’s mission and the
  birth of Christianity. Precisely this sort of exclusion of vulnerable
  and minority groups from society that saw Jesus enter the Temple to
  challenge the Priests’ authority to decide who was cast out, and who
  included in the circle of God’s concern.
  
  There’s a joke about a pamphlet entitled, “What Jesus said about
  Homosexuality.” When you open it, the pages are blank. As far as I can
  tell, even the lunar religious right in America admits that Jesus never
  said anything about homosexuality.
  
  But even if the Bible did advise us to shun homosexuals or stone them
  (as it suggests for adulterers), we don’t have to listen. After all, we
  ignore its command to wed our virginal daughters to their rapists, and
  refuse its permission to purchases the children of foreigners to serve
  us as slaves.
  
  The point is that even those who claim absolute obedience to scripture
  are selective in the scripture they obey. They know as well as anyone
  that there is much in the Bible that is irrelevant, outdated or just
  plain barbaric.
  
  And spare me the Bible-made-me-do-it crap. It didn’t work for the Nazis
  at Nuremberg and it won’t work here. Acting pursuant to orders by
  superiors of any sort doesn’t relieve an individual of responsibility if
  a moral choice is possible.
  
  Powerful Christian leaders have a choice. They don’t have to vilify and
  discriminate against gay people, they choose to, and for this they can -
  and should - be condemned.
  
  What sort of leader makes this sort of choice? Neither the word
  “Christian” or “ethical” spring to mind.
  
  Perhaps one day both our spiritual and political leaders will get it
  through their heads that taking potshots at people because of who they
  are, not what they do, is stupid, wrong and not very nice. That everyone
  deserves respect and a fair go no matter the colour of their skin, their
  marital status, if and how they worship or who they love. That
  individuals have a moral right to be judged on nothing more nor less
  than what Martin Luther King Jr. called, “the content of their
  character.”
  
  And if the powerful men who yearn for the good old days when they could
  stimatise and exclude whoever they liked while calling themselves holy
  refuse to change their prejudicial ways, they should have the courage to
  source this decision in their own dark heart, not an ancient book.

  Climate change, soaring petrol and food prices, one in seven Australian
  children living in poverty and catastrophic levels of violence in some
  indigenous communities. These are just some current issues of national
  importance that most Australians would see as legitimate topics for
  debate.
  
  Sadly, the womb watchers think otherwise.
  
  It is no secret that former Prime Minister Howard gave unprecedented
  license to the Christian fundamentalists in his party to use Australian
  women’s fertility decisions as a means of wedging and distracting the
  community. Single women with the temerity to want a child, and divorced
  mothers dependent on the dole to raise one were the Government’s
  favourite whipping girls.
  
  When Howard fell, taking with him his incendiary choice of Health
  Minister Tony Abbott - a.k.a. the \`mad monk’ - many sighed with relief.
  Surely the Ministerial appointments of Julia Gillard and Nicola Roxon,
  and the elevation of former AMA President Brendan Nelson to Opposition
  leader signalled the demise of womb-watching as a national sport, and
  the re-assertion of the commonsense belief that women and their partners
  have the right to decide if and when they bear children.
  
  But the view that the new Federal landscape represents a new dawn in
  fertility politics is about to be tested. On 18 June, Tasmanian Liberal
  Senator Guy Barnett gave notice of plans to table a motion in parliament
  that would make women more than 14 weeks pregnant undergoing labour for
  an “intrauterine fetal death, gross fetal abnormality or life
  threatening maternal disease” pay for the procedure themselves. Medicare
  funding, just for these women undertaking just this procedure, would no
  longer be available.
  
  So what if a woman has a dead fetus festering in her womb, or one
  affected by what Barnett himself describes as a “common disabilities
  such as Down syndrome and spina bifida.” Who cares if her condition puts
  her life at risk? Where do such women get off thinking they not only
  have a right to such medical care, but to have Medicare fund it? If Guy
  Barnett, a self-described man of “conscience,” has his way, such feral
  feminists will be coming down off that high horse, and quick.
  
  The issue will come to a vote in September. Whether, and how strenuously
  his Liberal and Labor colleagues will say much about the future of
  womb-watching in this country.
  
  Will Brendan Nelson maintain his long-held view that exiting Medicare
  arrangements must stay in place to avoid backyard abortion, or will he
  squib - as he did earlier this month when it came to lifting the ban on
  foreign aid paying for abortion - in a fruitless attempt to please the
  party’s right wing? Will Deputy PM Gillard and Health Minister Nicola
  Roxon, two women whose hearts are clearly in the right place on this
  issue stand up and be counted - both behind the scenes and in front of
  the cameras - or will their ambition get in the way?
  
  I’ve heard that when Barnett declared his intentions in the party room,
  most of his colleagues rolled their eyes. Not just because most
  Liberals-like most members of the ALP and 81% of Australians-support the
  right of individuals to decide, but because they are sick to death of
  discussing abortion.
  
  Guy Barnett, if you don’t want to have an abortion, it’s OK. You don’t
  have to have one. Now, can you get out of the conversational way so the
  rest of the nation can discuss the issues that really matter.

  You might think I am the sort of person who has always favoured a
  charter of human rights, but it isn’t so.
  
  Having come of age in the land of the free, I had witnessed first hand
  the social ructions caused by the Supreme Court’s invalidation of laws
  that violated the Bill of Rights. During my lifetime, I watched my
  country struggle to come to terms with the Supreme Court’s banning as
  unconstitutional of racially segregated schools, its upholding of the
  separation of Church and State and its striking down of laws banning
  abortion.
  
  In principle, I agreed with each one of these decisions, yet as a new
  migrant to Australia in the early 1990s, I thought this nation’s more
  incrementalist approach to social change had much to commend it. I
  thought, for example, that it may have been the less radical
  liberalisation of abortion laws in this country in the early 1970s that
  kept the issue off the political agenda, in contrast to the US where Roe
  v. Wade’s assertion of a woman’s right to choose had sparked the
  creation of a violent and tireless anti-choice opposition.
  
  I was wrong. The wishy-washy refusal of Australia’s varied abortion laws
  to dignify women as choosers did little to stop John Howard putting the
  issue firmly on the political agenda, where it has remained ever since.
  More importantly, I discovered that the American take on human rights is
  just one of many. Australia is now the only democratic nation without a
  rights charter and many nations, including the UK, have devised rights
  protection frameworks that are upside rich, and downside poor.
  Frameworks that depart from the American example by defending the
  existing power ratio between parliament and the courts while enabling a
  reasonable balancing of the individual rights of citizens and the
  collective wishes and entitlements of the majority.
  
  Here’s how it could work. First, parliament would pass a law defining
  the civil, political, economic, cultural and/or social rights of
  Australians. From that point on, all bills would be checked against this
  list of human rights. Where a bill is deemed incompatible, Parliament
  must formally explain how and why, though it can still become law.
  
  The Courts would also perform their interpretive role with an eye to
  human rights. Where a law appears in incompatible with the rights
  charter, the Courts could ask Parliament to reconsider it, but could not
  strike it down.
  
  So far, arguments against a Human Rights Act for Australia have been few
  and weak. This is not surprising, given the essential challenge of those
  in the “no” camp is to explain why our elected representatives should
  not even be asked to consider human rights, little less uphold them. The
  main line of argument has been to claim that the existing system has
  done such a good job of protecting our rights so far, there is no need
  to fix it.
  
  Hmmm. I suspect that David Hicks, Cornelia Rau and refugee children
  living in detention would disagree. And this is the point: that while a
  Human Rights charter would leave ultimate legislative power in the hands
  of MPs, it would require them to exercise that power more methodically,
  progressively and transparently, something that many seem keen to avoid.
  
  That is why David Marr reminds us that we would be wise to treat
  politicians who object to human rights charter with the same seriousness
  that we would burglars who object to alarm systems. Not, in other words,
  very seriously at all.

  However cynical, petty, ideological and pathetically out-of-date it may
  be, the attack by right-wing “think-tanks” on fair trade just won’t go
  away.
  
  As most coffee-drinkers know, Fairtrade (and its new competitor
  Rainforest Alliance) are dedicated to increasing the ethical footprint
  of western consumers by encouraging them to buy products that offer a
  better deal to those in the developing world who make them. In essence,
  fair trade schemes ask us to pay more for things we are told have been
  farmed in a sustainable way by workers protected by International Labor
  Organisation conventions.
  
  Implicit in the very project of ethical consumerism is a critique of the
  way we currently do business when it comes to global trade, and the
  values that underlie the free trade ideal.
  
  No wonder Tim Wilson, from the free market Institute of Public Affairs,
  is pursed lipped. In an interview on ABC Radio National’s Background
  Briefing Wilson claimed to be worried that consumers buying fair trade
  products were being [duped]() “Developed country consumers are buying
  these products with the expectation that the right thing is being done
  by them and the developing world producers, and that isn’t always
  occurring.”
  
  The problems to which Wilson refers are ones that no one, most notably
  Fairtrade officials and advocates, deny. Namely, that Fairtrade isn’t
  perfect, and that one consequence of its imperfection can be a
  disconnect between what consumers are promised for the premium they pay,
  and what is delivered. For example, an investigation a few years ago by
  the UK’s Financial Times, found that some fair trade farmers were not
  paying their labour the legal minimum wage, though these workers were
  getting 25% more than those picking coffee on conventional farms.
  
  In an article on the IPA website, Wilson suggests that on the evidence
  of history, such problems are without remedy. “The International Coffee
  Agreement operated for most of the Cold War period to help developing
  world coffee producers lift themselves out of poverty. It was a
  monumental failure.”
  
  Elsewhere he contends that even if fair trade could be made to work,
  there is little reason to bother, because free trade provides all the
  equity and justice this world needs: “Free trade has…worked for many,
  many years now…The fairest outcome [results] from a system where prices
  are set by the marketplace.”
  
  Yeah, and pigs fly. Throughout history an unregulated market has brought
  us gross disparities of wealth, corruption, child labour and sweatshops.
  As that screaming left-winger Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the US
  Federal Reserve, conceded in a recent speech, it has also delivered the
  sub-prime mortgage crisis.
  
  The IPA has long been funded by the major corporates: BHP-Billiton,
  Monsanto, Caltex and Gunns to name a few. Businesses that have done well
  from existing trade conditions and would like to see them roll on. We’re
  still waiting for Peruvian coffee-growers to fund a think-tank. The
  IPA’s objections to ethical consumerism are vested and ideological, in
  other words, not a response to the occasional promise/reality gap that
  the fair trade movement is working hard to fix.
  
  It is easy for self-serving cynics to drain our idealism. Easy to make
  us feel that however good our intentions and however much we try, there
  is nothing we can do to make the world a fairer place. So we might as
  well just shut up and shop.
  
  Don’t believe the hype. While it’s neither enough nor perfect, ethical
  consumerism is better than business-as-usual. Drink your coffee, join
  the movement and keep the faith.

  Moral Maze: Teaching our Kids the Difference Between Science and Faith
  
  Defeating the religious right’s latest attack on reason and evidence
  requires beating them at their own game.
  
  The current site of the controversy is the US, where Louisiana has
  passed a law requiring the education bureaucracy to assist schools that
  wish to help students “understand, analyze, critique, and review”
  scientific theories like evolution, the origins of life, global warming,
  and human cloning.
  
  Intelligent design, or its forerunner creation science, in sheep’s
  clothing? You betcha. But dressed up as academic freedom, the new law is
  predicted to succeed in introducing biblical principles into the
  classroom where those in more blatant contravention of the US separation
  of Church and State have failed.
  
  I’m on their side, but I reckon the opponents of this bill, and the many
  predicted to follow it into legislatures across the country, need to
  modify their language and tactics if they want to beat their wealthy,
  dedicated and relentless opponent: the fundamentalist Christian
  churches.
  
  First and foremost, they need to get past their moral indignation at the
  slick and cynical use by bible-bashers of the language and values of the
  progressive left. To do this, they need to stop arguing against the
  legislation on the grounds that Darwinian evolution is “accepted
  scientific fact,” and get on with turning the stated goals of the new
  “academic freedom” legislation to their advantage.
  
  Because at the heart of this debate is not evolution, or any other
  answer to key questions that the scientific method turns up at a point
  in history, but the workings of the method itself. Currently, primary
  and secondary school children are taught scientific content: the
  conclusions of scientific investigation into questions like “how did
  life on earth begin?” Only when students enter university, are the
  methods used to reach such conclusions properly explained and used to
  critique contemporary answers to key questions.
  
  This is ass-around backwards. As business leaders have been telling us
  for years, what we need in our rapid-fire world, where knowledge dates
  faster than it takes to chew a piece of gum, is people who know how to
  assess the value of new information and—where it is deemed valid and
  valuable—to acquire it. People, in other words, who don’t know stuff,
  but know how to think.
  
  No matter how widely accepted it is today, no theory—including
  evolution—is beyond question. The accumulation of enough
  counter-evidence, or the successful questioning of the method or logic
  used to develop the theory in the first place, will topple it in the
  sort of paradigm shift that makes academic careers and defines human
  progress. This is how reason and evidence-based systems, of which
  science is one, work.
  
  Only by accepting this, and by turning the ruthless objectivity of
  reason and evidence-based systems to their advantage, can those seeking
  to defend modern ways of knowing against pre-enlightenment ones based on
  faith, tradition or plain superstition, prevail.
  
  Perhaps the latest manifestation of creationism, and the threat it poses
  to post-enlightenment ways of doing business, could prompt educators to
  listen. To stop stuffing our primary and secondary school children with
  reams of content certain to date, and to teach them instead to consider
  the validity of the varying methods humans have tried over time to
  decide what is right and true.
  
  If they know this we won’t have to tell them that creationism, or
  whatever theory the faith-based crowd decide to throw at us next year,
  is something we can choose to believe it, but not something we can know.
  
  They will be able to work this out for themselves.

  Are you a foul-mouthed, domestic disaster of a young woman who cares
  more about footy than fashion, enjoys sex and can drink a bloke under
  the table? Then you should know that the Australian version of the
  British reality TV show, Ladette to Lady, is looking for you.
  
  Good on Channel 9 for picking up the ball on this gem of a concept, and
  the Sunday Age for splashing the story-such as it was-across the front
  page of last week’s paper. If the chronicling of the descent of young
  Australian women to abject unmarriageability, and their restoration to
  the status of useless appendage by the matrons of an English finishing
  school, isn’t a matter of national importance, I don’t know what is.
  
  You only need to imagine a man in the role of a Ladette to grasp the
  show’s fundamental misogyny. A man claiming to be “thrilled” at what
  he’s “achieved” in the wake of a successful flower-arranging session; a
  man being told in all seriousness that the acquisition of the proper
  technique for imbibing champagne will give him the self-confidence
  necessary to progress further in life; a man still smiling from the fun
  of a minor food fight being asked pointedly whether he had seen himself
  in the mirror. It would never, ever happen. Only women’s capacities and
  aspirations could be trivialized in the frank and unapologetic manner
  that is the trademark of Ladette to Lady.
  
  The show also reeks of classism, implying in a none-too-subtle fashion
  that it is lower-class attitudes, accents and fiscal imperatives that
  have brought the lady-like ideal to its knees. Ladettes are instructed
  in elocution and deportment, and the inadequacy of their working class
  salaries to support a lady’s life of leisure - Ladettes work as gas
  fitters and tanning salon operators - is underscored. It is the
  necessary fiscal dependence of a lady that explains the centrality in
  the show’s format of activities where the Ladettes are paraded like
  ponies before wealthy men, and offered the chance to use their feminine
  wiles to trap one into marriage.
  
  Indeed, it was the frank encouragement the crone-like instructresses at
  Eggleston Hall gave to the Ladettes to abandon their economic and
  emotional independence from men for the better life available through
  submission to the dictates of femininity that depressed me most of all.
  These women are the 21st century’s foot-binders. Indeed, they are worse
  than the Chinese mother and grandmothers who ritually crippled their
  daughters’ feet because at least the fate these women were attempting to
  help their daughters avoid through a good marriage was the short,
  brutish and nasty life of a female peasant.
  
  Nothing so noble is going on here. Instead the staff at Eggleston Hall
  are the unabashed handmaidens of the patriarchy, thieving the
  self-confidence and self-esteem that is essential to their young
  charges’ rebellion and using the feminine ideal as a cudgel to beat the
  brash and non-conformist Ladettes into submission.
  
  The rise of Ladette to Lady suggests that, at the start of the 21sth
  century, there is nothing more fearsome than young women happy in their
  own company, more interested in fun than pleasing men or getting
  married, and comfortable in using the purchasing power derived from
  their independent incomes to avoid the tedious tasks that have defined
  the lives of women for millennia. “Who cares if you can…bake a cake,”
  one young woman told The Sunday Age. “You can buy cakes from the cake
  shop.”
  
  Well exactly.

  Have you heard about Lucy? The intensively-farmed sow with the
  intelligence of a three year old who, in a series of Australian radio
  ads, tells of a life so miserable that she wishes she could “close [her]
  eyes and not wake up.”
  
  Many would see the Lucy ads as a call for more Australians to become
  vegetarian or vegan. This would not be a bad thing. Vegetarians walk the
  walk. Whether frowning at menus short of meat-free options or
  unapologetically arriving at cocktail parties in tennis shoes, they put
  their morals where there mouths are and by so doing implicitly challenge
  the rest of us to do the same. “I care about the suffering of animals,
  and so I don’t eat meat or wear leather,” the vegetarian wordlessly
  proclaims. “What about you?”
  
  Personally, I’ve been on both sides of the meat-eating divide. A
  vegetarian during my late teens and twenties on ethical grounds, I began
  eating meat again when, pregnant for the first time, my dreams became
  crowded with steak and hamburgers and my midwife diagnosed me with low
  levels of iron. Another pregnancy and more than a decade later, I have
  never looked back.
  
  But while I continue to eat and enjoy meat, I rarely feel guilty. This
  is because, for the most part, I am an ethical carnivore.
  
  Most people don’t know it, but the central claim in Professor Peter
  Singer’s revolutionary book Animal Liberation is that because animals
  suffer, they are owed moral consideration. The sort of moral
  consideration that requires we humans to eliminate any unnecessary
  suffering, and reduce as much as possible the suffering justified by the
  greater good: like that caused by scientific experiments which will
  yield important results that can not be obtained in any other way.
  
  This means that while vegetarianism is a good way of meeting our moral
  obligations to animals, it is not the only one. Another is to commit
  ourselves to only consuming animal products that have been farmed in
  ethical ways: in way that mean that the animal does not suffer during
  its life or, as far as is possible, in the slaughtering process.
  
  Does this mean ethical carnivores eat less meat? Almost certainly yes,
  as most restaurants serve factory-farmed products, so most meat-eating
  must be done at home. But it also means that when we take the time and
  pay the cash for free-range pork, chicken and eggs, we can consume it
  guilt-free.
  
  The Lucy ad is the latest in a long-line of attempts by animal
  liberationists to inform us of the intense, unnecessary and unjustified
  suffering of intensively farmed animals. Animals that may spend their
  entire lives in darkness and in cramped boxes that deny them the freedom
  to stretch, turn, or even stand, little less perform any of their normal
  behavioral repertoire like scratching or nursing young. Animals whose
  suffering should and does move us.
  
  Ethical carnivores accept that the indifference of western consumers to
  the suffering of animals is a consequence of our removal from the
  gruesome and inhumane conditions in which most live and die. We accept
  that it is our obligation to look at the reality of the lives of the
  animals whose flesh and products we consume, and accept responsibility
  for it.
  
  But we believe that turning vegetarian or vegan is not the only way to
  do this. Another is to make sure that the life of the animal we consume
  have been managed with care.

  Abortion is back in the news, with a bill now before the Victorian
  parliament that, if it becomes law, will give women with problem
  pregnancies of less than twenty-four weeks the right to decide for
  themselves.
  
  Whenever abortion is at issue, questions about the place of men in the
  debate looms large and unspoken. What role do men play in political and
  personal discussions about termination, and what role - morally speaking
  - should they play?
  
  The facts are simple. Men dominate the politics of abortion in the same
  way they do all other issues. One figure puts the percentage of
  anti-choice leaders who are men at 77%. This is in addition to the
  significant influence male religious leaders like the Pope (through the
  Vatican’s full membership of the United Nations) have on reproductive
  health policy across the globe.
  
  Even on the pro-choice side, where most leadership roles are held by
  women, men have been critical to the success of campaigns that give
  women the right to decide. MP Wayne Berry was the architect of the 2002
  legislation in the ACT that treats abortion like any other medical
  procedure. Henry Morgentaler was key to achieving a similarly
  progressive law in Canada in 1988.
  
  Problem pregnancies require decisions that touch on our most intimate
  experiences and values concerning sex, fertility, love and
  relationships. Here again, men feature large. Research shows that while
  the vast majority of women faced with an unplanned pregnancy don’t want
  counselling, they do want information from the biological father.
  Indeed, he is the person they are most likely to consult as they
  consider their choice. Does he want a child, now or ever? What role will
  he play in raising it? What support might he provide if she decides to
  go it alone? The presence of a man willing to engage in such
  discussions, and the answers he gives, will critically affect the
  woman’s decision.
  
  So men do play a critical role in abortion politics and abortion
  decisions. The question is, should they?
  
  Men’s role in the decisions individual women make about problem
  pregnancies is a simple fact of life to which no “ought” can or should
  be applied.
  
  But before you can determine the proper role of men in the political
  debate, you must recognise the fact that-at the end of the day-a
  decision about continuing or terminating a pregnancy is not open to
  compromise. You can’t have half a baby or half an abortion. While women
  in functioning, non-violent relationships do tend to consult the
  biological father, ultimately one person’s view must prevail. The law
  privileges the woman’s decision because the bodily experience of
  pregnancy and birth invest her more heavily in the outcome.
  
  It is also her call because, short of making a pregnant woman the
  biological father’s slave, there would be no way to enforce his right to
  decide other than giving him the power to wrestle her on to the surgical
  table (if she wants to continue and he wants to terminate) or snapping a
  collar on her and handing him the lead (if she wants to terminate and he
  wants to continue).
  
  Does men’s disconnect from the risk and experience of pregnancy and
  birth disqualify them from political activism on the issue? Part of the
  answer turns on the weight you give to experience.
  
  Imagine a woman-led and dominated group that sought to deny men access
  to safe and legal vasectomies on the grounds that the procedure is
  dangerous, that men might come to regret their decision and that
  vasectomies reduce the number of babies being born that infertile
  couples would be more than happy to raise.
  
  Do we think such a group is legitimate? That its views should hold sway
  on the laws passed by parliament? Or do the demands of such an
  organisation with regard to a procedure so intimately bound up with
  men’s bodies and lives strike you as inappropriate, patronising and
  domineeringly presumptive?
  
  For me, it’s the latter. But I would feel differently if such a
  female-dominated group came into being in a world where men were
  struggling to achieve the legal right to choose safe vasectomy, and the
  group’s aims were to help men gain control over an issue so critical to
  their bodies and lives.
  
  What matters, in other words, is not that men are involved but how they
  are involved.
  
  Men lack moral standing in the abortion debate-indeed are guilty of
  moral arrogance-when they push for control over a procedure they’ll
  never have to have because they can’t get pregnant.
  
  But when men implicitly acknowledge their lesser standing by raising
  their voices in support of laws that take away power from their own sex
  in order to give it to women, they can feel confident they are doing the
  right thing.

  They’ve done it again. For the third time, scientists have found
  evidence that the contraceptive pill may be inhibiting women’s capacity
  to conceive in more ways than one. Worse, it may be playing havoc with
  their love lives.
  
  The most recent findings, published in this month’s Proceedings of the
  Royal Society, show that women who take the pill have an altered sense
  of smell. Specifically, they delight in the scents of men who have a
  similar, rather than a complimentary, immune system.
  
  The finding follows two other studies, both done in the 1990s, that
  suggested oral contraception may disrupt a woman’s pheromone detection
  system.
  
  The implications of such disruption are vast. Pheromones play an
  important role in the normal human mating process. If pill-taking women
  are drawn to what are, genetically speaking, the “wrong” men, the
  results could include increased difficulties conceiving, higher rates of
  miscarriage, longer intervals between pregnancies and-when at last they
  arrive-genetically compromised offspring. Not to mention, given the role
  smell plays in maintaining partnerships, more divorces.
  
  Women may respond to such research findings with the same sense of
  dismay, and the same feelings of betrayal, as they did to the news that
  those ingesting combination HRT pills to prevent heart disease were not
  only wasting their time, but putting their overall health at risk.
  
  Such a response would be a good thing if it leads Australian women to
  take a more active and skeptical role in decisions about what they put
  in their bodies. The kind of attitude that would lead them to
  reject-once and for all-the belief that pharmaceuticals interventions
  wouldn’t be licensed, sold or recommended unless they were “safe.”
  
  The truth is far trickier. According to science journalist Ray Moynihan,
  the undisputed expert on this matter, “a significant proportion of what
  many doctors do for their patients is not based on good scientific
  evidence.”
  
  There are vast problems with the information on which critical decisions
  about our health are currently based. They include the fact that, even
  where data exists, it often does not come from the double-blind
  placebo-controlled trials that are the gold standard for producing valid
  and reliable knowledge about what is safe and effective.
  
  Indeed, even when studies have been done, and done properly, their
  capacity to answer the question most women want to know-namely “is it
  safe for me to use in the long-term”-may be limited. This is because the
  expense of conducting good research means most studies only look at
  short-term side-effects and fail to assemble large and diverse enough
  samples to ensure rare problems-only those impacting on women or blacks
  or other sub-groups-will be uncovered.
  
  Finally, we need to remember that for the most part, researchers need to
  look for a problem to find it. Even a gold standard trial with a large
  and diverse sample that follows participants for many years will not
  uncover cancer as a long-term side effect of treatment if heart trouble
  is the only complication they are measuring.
  
  So what should women do? When it comes to pharmaceuticals, a
  common-sense approach would be to ingest and insert as little as
  possible. Where something must be taken, it seems wise to choose the
  least invasive, most reversible and lowest risk option, and to use it
  for the shortest period possible.
  
  And if you are currently in the market for a partner with whom to have
  children? It couldn’t hurt to come off the pill, and have a good sniff
  around.

  Political activism is often a thankless task. It’s worse when the cause
  is not just controversial, but shrouded in stigma and shame. Yes, a lot
  of hard work goes into raising cash for breast cancer research or to
  send disabled athletes to Beijing, but at least it’s easy to ask your
  colleagues and friends to donate, and to get VIPs to sign on as patrons
  to the cause.
  
  Michael Cain is a 26 year-old gay man living in Tasmania who has stuck
  his head above the parapet to make a stand on an issue of equity and
  justice. But the battle Cain’s picked is one that not only opens him to
  scorn and aggression because it reveals his sexual orientation, but of
  accusations that he is putting his own interests ahead of the public
  good.
  
  Nothing could be further from the truth.
  
  In 2005, the Australian Red Cross Blood Service refused Michael Cain’s
  offer to donate blood because he has sex with men. Cain thinks the
  grounds for this refusal amount to unjust discrimination, and he has
  taken his case to the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Tribunal. The
  question he wants the Red Cross to answer is simple. Why, given that he
  practises safe sex, won’t they let him donate, when the Red Cross leaves
  the welcome light on for donors who are sexually promiscuous and never
  come within coo-ee of a condom, as long as they are straight.
  
  It doesn’t make sense. Australia is widely acknowledged as having one of
  the most intelligent and effective public health strategies to combat
  the spread of the virus in the world. At the core of our policies is a
  consistent and clear message about safe sex.
  
  The risk of transmission of HIV/AIDS through the blood supply is
  negligible, thanks to tests able to determine whether the virus is
  present. To guard against the teeny, tiny risk that human error could
  see infected blood mistakenly released into the blood supply, the Red
  Cross tries to stop donors at risk of HIV/AIDS from holding out their
  arm in the first place.
  
  Well and good, but the question is: who is at risk of catching HIV/AIDS?
  
  What public health experts have been telling us since the 1980s is that
  those who have unsafe sex are at risk. What Cain wants the Red Cross to
  do is screen out only those donors who practice unsafe sex, regardless
  of the gender of their sexual partners.
  
  In a happy coincidence, screening policies based on the riskiness of
  sexual activity are both discrimination-free and effective. When Italy
  switched from a screening policy based on the gender of the sexual
  partner to one focused on risky behaviours, their transmission rates of
  HIV through blood donation fell.
  
  Using figures provided by one of the Red Cross’s own witnesses, Cain’s
  legal team have shown that an Australian donor policy based on safety of
  sexual activity would see an HIV positive donation from a gay man slip
  through donor screening and clinical testing once every 5769 years. In
  other words, never.
  
  Discrimination on the basis of characteristics over which we have no
  control, and which do not impact on our capacity to do the job, is
  always wrong. The law does not, and should not, allow it.
  
  The fact that when it comes to blood donation, doing the right thing may
  make the blood supply safer, and more safe blood available, means change
  can’t come soon enough.

  Lord help me, here comes another conscience vote. This time, it’s about
  whether our Federal MPs think it’s OK to spend our taxes on the cost of
  an abortion necessary to save a woman’s life, or to evacuate her uterus
  of a fetus that is already dead, or affected by “gross” abnormalities.
  In 2006, Parliamentarians were allowed to exercise their moral judgment
  on the acceptability of therapeutic cloning techniques to explore cures
  for diseases like Parkinson’ disease and help for those confined for
  life to wheelchairs. RU486, and before this, the Northern Territory’s
  euthanasia bill.
  
  Conscience votes sound like a great idea. Some argue that they are
  democracy at work, with legislators freed from party discipline and
  factional pressure to form a view based on the evidence, and express it
  through their vote.
  
  The truth is more complex. Yes, conscience votes are a noble idea, but
  unless parliamentarians understand both their rights and
  responsibilities when they cast one, the results can be, well,
  unconscionable.
  
  Here’s how it’s meant to work. The right to follow the dictates of our
  conscience comes from the value of autonomy. Autonomy means self-rule,
  and an autonomous person is one who is free to live her life according
  to her own values.
  
  Autonomy matters to Australians. It is no exaggeration to say that in
  western countries like ours, it is the value that reigns supreme. Woven
  into the fabric of a political system that has individual liberty as its
  central goal, it is also central to the common law view that a person is
  legally responsible for her choices and so must be free to make them.\
  Conscience votes protect the autonomy of MPs. They allow them to follow
  the dictates of their conscience by letting them vote for something they
  believe is right, and against what they think is wrong.
  
  But not so fast.
  
  MPs, like all professionals, don’t just have rights, they have
  responsibilities. By fighting for an issue to be decided by conscience
  vote, or just accepting the privilege of casting one, they acknowledge
  how important it is for them to live as they believe.
  
  In what way is it fair or just then, for them to a cast a vote that
  deprives others of the same freedom they enjoy with their vote: the
  freedom to follow their conscience? Yet, this is what many do. Indeed,
  it is those who fight so hard for personal moral issues like abortion
  and stem cell research to be decided by conscience vote, that go on to
  cast their vote in such a way as to deny the importance of conscience in
  the lives of others. They vote against legislation that would give women
  the right to exercise their consciences on the abortion question, or
  those with critical illness the freedom to decide their own fate.
  
  Hypocrisy? Absolutely, and made all the worse by the fact that MPs are
  the ones who are meant to be protecting the autonomy - and the rights of
  conscience - of their constituents, not undermining it. The job
  description in a liberal democratic country like ours is not to impose
  their values on us, but to legislate in ways that uphold the priniciple
  that we, not they, know what is right for us.
  
  A few years ago mutual obligation was the moral concept of the month,
  and if this isn’t a mutual obligation issue, I don’t know what is. Yes,
  as members of our community, politicians have a right to live their
  lives according to their values. But as our elected representatives,
  they have responsibilities, too. Namely, to take the conscience rights
  of those they are bound to serve as seriously as they do their own.

  The education revolution promised by Federal Government continues to
  piss me off. First it was a computer for every secondary school student;
  then it wasn’t. These days, the so-called digital revolution means that
  at some point in the next five years two students will share one
  computer, if the money to actually install the things and pay for the
  cost of running them can be found.
  
  It was a stupid promise to begin with. Everyone knows that improved
  educational outcomes for students begin and end with the quality of the
  teacher in front of the classroom. Gadgetry is neither here nor there.
  
  But compared to the Rudd government’s more recent emphasis on school
  report cards, the computer-on-every-desk promise was rocket science.
  
  According to the Government, parents need to be regularly informed of
  the socio-economic status of children attending their school, and the
  number who are indigenous or have disabilities. We also need to be
  informed about class sizes, absenteeism and retention rates, student
  satisfaction and scores on national tests. We parents need such
  information, one radio commentator, so we know when its time to “move”
  our child “on.”
  
  If the parental report card scheme, dubbed SchoolWatch by the Australian
  Education Union, sounds familiar, it’s because it is. Reports-
  for-dollars was the Howard government’s brainchild. But just because
  it’s clever politics, wedging the Liberals tighter than Cinderella’s
  foot, doesn’t make it sound educational policy.
  
  The central delusion of the plan is the same: that taking and reporting
  on the temperature of the sick child that is our public school system
  amounts to a cure.
  
  It doesn’t, though no one can argue with the price: to governments, that
  is Compared to actually putting more money into the system (Australia
  ranks 18th among the 30 OECD countries in educational spending) banging
  on about the importance of schools being accountable is cheaper than
  chips.
  
  Governments, state and Federal, keep telling me that I have a right to
  know how my child’s school is performing, and how it compares to others
  in the area. But trust me, I already know. Like every other parent at my
  son’s secondary school, I am fully across the substandard level of the
  facility where for five days of every week my child spends nearly half
  his waking hours, and the mediocre education he gets there.
  
  How about that: not a single report card required!
  
  So, why don’t I “move him on”? Move him on? Move him on? To where
  exactly-another underperforming school? That’s my only option as every
  decent public school in the entire inner city was booked solid this
  year, just as it was the previous year and the one before that when I
  first began knocking. Even without report cards, it seems parents know
  full well where a good education can be found, with those who can paying
  for it, or moving into the increasingly expensive enclaves that harbor a
  good public school.
  
  If we want our schools to perform better we don’t need to report on
  them, we need to invest in them. Paying our teachers better and giving
  them a workplace rich in support and resources, and poor in bureaucratic
  busy work, would be a good place to start.
  
  Teachers know it. Parents know it, and Governments do, too. They just
  don’t want to spend the cash.

  Denying another’s freedom while exercising one’s own is hypocritical
  
  Is it ever right to use one’s freedom to deny the exact same freedom to
  others? What if those others are people you are sworn to serve and
  protect?
  
  Such questions may not be front of mind for our State MPs, but they
  should be. Before the year is out, Victorian Parliamentarians will cast
  a conscience vote on bills about physician-assisted suicide, abortion
  and Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs). Conscience clauses will
  be contained in each of these bills.
  
  Our understanding of the proper role of conscience in politics and
  health remains remain murky. What is conscience, why are we pledged to
  honour it, and what responsibilities do those who claim the right to
  follow theirs have to others?
  
  The right to act according to the dictates of our conscience is founded
  in the value of autonomy. Autonomy means self-rule. An autonomous person
  is one who is free to direct her life according to her own values.
  
  It would be hard to overestimate the role autonomy-and so
  conscience-plays in the value systems of contemporary Australian
  society. Our political and legal structures are grounded in the belief,
  to paraphrase High Court Justice McHugh, that autonomous individuals are
  entitled to make, and are consequently responsible for their own
  choices. Our health system, in line with that of others in the western
  world, has shifted in the last few decades from the paternalistic idea
  that doctors know best, to the view that patients have a right to make
  their own informed choices about their care.
  
  All this suggests what is true: that most learned discussions of
  conscience focus on the duties lawmakers and medicos have to protect the
  autonomy of citizens and patients. This is for good reason. Both our
  elected representatives and health care staff are professionals: trusted
  and respected members of society with a duty of care to those they are
  sworn to serve and heal.
  
  Despite this, some professionals in Victoria seem primarily concerned
  with their rights when it comes to conscience, not their obligations.
  Some MPs, understandably pleased at the rare opportunity to shrug off
  party discipline, see a conscience vote as a chance for them to register
  their own value positions on the issues at hand. In the same way,
  conscience clauses in bills on euthanasia, abortion and ARTs tend to
  spell out the entitlements of medical professionals to refuse treatment
  they deem morally objectionable, but are silent on their obligations to
  ensure patients get timely, appropriate care.
  
  We need to get the balance right. Yes, the entitlements of MPs and
  medical professionals to follow the dictates of their consciences are
  part of the autonomy story. But if mutual obligation means anything,
  then political and medical professionals who assert their right to vote
  or to refuse care on grounds of conscience must take their
  responsibilities to foster the autonomy of those they are bound to
  serve-we citizens and patients-just as seriously.
  
  They can do this by recognizing that it is unconscionable for someone to
  defend the right to follow his conscience, then deny that very same
  right to someone else. Such moral hypocrisy is compounded when those
  denying the autonomy of others are professionals, and those they are
  denying are the citizens or patients they are sworn to serve.
  
  For politicians, this means thinking twice about using a conscience vote
  to pass a law that denies citizens the right to act on their consciences
  when terminally ill, facing an unplanned pregnancy or seeking to
  conceive using ARTs.
  
  For medical professionals, it means ensuring that all conscience clauses
  in legislation include an obligation to refer. That is, where the law
  articulates the right of doctors, nurses and pharmacists to refuse
  treatment on grounds of conscience, it must also spell out the
  obligations of professionals to ensure the needs of their patients are
  met elsewhere. Pro-life groups continue to resist such basic demands,
  though medicos tend to be on board. A recent letter to all Victorian MPs
  signed by a number of religious leaders spent paragraphs detailing the
  extensive rights of health care workers to refuse treatment on grounds
  of conscience, and just one sentence tartly rejecting the idea these
  providers had any obligation to refer. In contrast, the ethical practice
  guidelines of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of
  Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) instructs its members to
  “offer or arrange a further opinion and/or ongoing care with another
  suitable practitioner if…the therapy required is in conflict with [your]
  personal belief/value system.”
  
  With all rights come obligations, and the freedom to follow one’s
  conscience is no exception. As members of our community, politicians and
  health care workers are as entitled as the rest of us to live their
  lives according to their values.
  
  But because they are professionals, these rights come with significant
  responsibilities, responsibilities that come down to a requirement that
  those who act from conscience live by the golden rule.
  
  Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

  Peter Bloody Costello. Thank heavens the man is about to exit the
  national political stage because, quite frankly, I’m not sure I could
  take another minute of him.
  
  It’s not the smirk. My problem is the sense of entitlement. The standard
  analysis of Costello’s failure to challenge Howard for the leadership is
  that he lacked the courage. Peter Costello, said Paul Keating back in
  2005, has the heart the size of a caraway seed. This is probably true,
  but certainly too superficial. Listening to Costello blather on to those
  who care about the whys and wherefores of the challenge-that-never-was,
  what I hear is man who didn’t think he should have to take risks or work
  up a sweat in order to be appointed - forget about elected to - one of
  the highest offices in the land. He seemed to feel others should simply
  recognise his obvious qualifications for the post and hand it over, tied
  with a bow.
  
  Costello’s post ministerial career reeks of the same sense of nobless
  self-oblige. While writers around the nation wait tables or sell socks
  or try and squeeze in few hours at the computer late at night after
  their day job is done and the kids are asleep, he rakes in a
  back-bencher’s salary while unapologetically writing his memoirs. No
  need for Peter to scrape about for a rare and piddling literature grant
  that other writers would make Faustian deals to secure despite the fact
  they barely cover the rent. He’ll just let the people of Higgins cover
  it. And if they don’t like it? Well, off with their heads.
  
  Apparently, this sort of tacit tax-payer literary retreat is the Member
  for Higgins’ due, given all he had “contributed” during this time of
  office. Apparently he is entitled to stay in the seat of Higgins for as
  long as he wants until plans for his future career moves have
  solidified. Or so say key members of the Canberra Press gallery, who
  continue to report - with no sign of concern or alarm - on the “Salary
  Accepted but No One Home” sign that has been on the former Treasurer’s
  office door for close to a year.
  
  Well I’m alarmed. Alarmed and aghast. I mean this is the man who, with
  his now-nemesis John Howard, spoke in glowing terms about programs like
  work for the dole because they reflected the “benefits of mutual
  obligation.” This from a key point man in a government that routinely
  disparaged those on welfare as “dole bludgers,” and criticised
  Australians who didn’t move interstate to find work as “job snobs.” This
  from a man who insisted the unemployed become more “self-sufficient,”
  and that welfare benefits be understood as a “social support in a time
  of need, not a permanent handout.”
  
  Costello isn’t unemployed but if there was any justice in the world, he
  would be. Out on his ass in a pile of snow streaked yellow with dog pee.
  I’ve worked in a number of places in my time, but none where I had the
  option to throw aside the job description so I could use the office
  space to focus on things I found more lucrative and interesting.
  
  That a Federal MP gets away with cheating his electorate of a
  representative more interested in improving their life stories than
  telling his, while they foot the bill-a sort of job-bludging that if we
  were in his shoes and he were still Treasurer he would surely have
  condemned - shames us all.

  In the early 1990s I worked as a researcher for an organization
  dedicated to finding accommodation for young, homeless women. Many of
  these young women were escaping violent homes and, if they were lucky
  enough to get a bed in a refuge, they often found more violence there.
  
  My female co-workers thought they had the answer: single sex
  accommodation. The only problem was that the actual and threatened
  assaults the young women told me about were not just from angry young
  men, but hardened young women who’d been on the streets for years. Over
  many months I dutifully reported to my superiors what the young women
  told me: that they were as afraid of assaults from their own sex as from
  the opposite one, but my findings were rejected as lies and distraction.
  The earth was round, the sky was blue and women were victims of
  violence, not perpetrators.
  
  The job ended and I gave little thought to the issue. Until last week,
  when a friend of mine-a gentle man with a heart of gold-told me
  something that made his cheeks flame, and his typically brash voice fall
  to a whisper.
  
  His wife had hit him. Several times, and viciously, leaving him in so
  much pain he feared a broken rib. He was clearly upset and I was
  \\unsure what to say. So unsure that as he was telling me about how she
  had followed him around the house, jabbing him, I blurted out, “But
  you’re a decent sized bloke. Why didn’t you stop her?”
  
  Here’s what he said. “I did. I restrained her, but I…I’m a gentle
  person. I don’t want to hit her. I don’t want to hit anyone. So she
  would calm down and I would let her go and then, when I wasn’t looking,
  she’d go me again.”
  
  Figures vary but studies suggest that around one in five Australian
  women will experience relationship violence in their lifetime. The AMA
  describes partner violence as an abuse of power, evidenced by the
  domination, coercion, intimidation or victimisation of one person by
  another using physical, sexual or emotional means.
  
  While fewer both in number, and among those killed or seriously injured,
  men can also be victims of spousal abuse. Victorian hospital admission
  figures show that 1.3% of women and 0.14% of men are admitted to
  casualty because of partner-inflicted injury.
  
  Australia is sexist society. While the usual object of this charge is
  the unconscious, deliberate and institutional biases that unjustly
  discriminate against women in favour of men, when it comes to public
  perceptions of domestic violence, it is men who suffer most. Actor Tom
  Long, who played a man abducted and raped by three women in the 2006
  film The Book of Revelation, gives a feel for the problem when he admits
  his first reading of the script made him angry. “I didn’t like the idea
  of men losing their power. I wanted to call into question, well how can
  women do that?”
  
  But if domestic violence and rape are abuses of power, it is not hard to
  understand how men can be victims. The superior physical power most men
  have over most women does not grant them emotional mastery in domestic
  confrontations.
  
  And while it seems wretched and grossly unfair, one thing violent women
  can and do take advantage of is the lesson that good men have had
  tattood on their souls since childhood.
  
  Never ever raise your hand to a woman.

  Yesterday was a big day for my child. The start of term at the primary
  school he has attended since kinder, and the first day of work for the
  principal. Oh, and the day he had to fight through a media scrum to get
  through the front gate.
  
  Yes, my child attends [that school]() the one embroiled in the most
  recent installment of the Henson saga. At the time of the “incident”
  chronicled in an extract of David Marr’s forthcoming book, both my kids
  were there.
  
  So as the moral panic that has surrounded this case since it first hit
  the headlines cranks into gear again, I want to set the record straight.
  I am not “revolted and horrified” (the PM), “outraged” (Malcolm
  Turnball) nor feeling “betrayed” (Bill Heffernan) that former principal
  of my child’s school escorted the godparent of a student at the
  school-internationally renowned artist Bill Henson-through the
  playground so he could see whether any of the children might be
  appropriate models.
  
  Nor am I horrified, outraged, revolted or feeling betrayed that after
  Henson identified one girl and one boy, that the principal-not
  Henson-contacted the children’s parents, gave them the artist’s number
  and then bowed out: leaving the decision about making contact with the
  parents. The girl’s parents never made the call, the boy’s-believing the
  experience would be good for his confidence-went ahead.
  
  Here’s what does concern me: the boy in the eye of this new storm. I
  understand he felt proud of his selection as an artist’s model, and was
  pleased with the photos. In the wake of reporters staking out the school
  and confused classmates asking questions, how might he be feeling now?
  How ironic that those fueling the current hysteria claim to be concerned
  about the child’s best interests when only the profoundly deluded would
  claim that the feeding frenzy that now threatens to devour this young
  boy serves to protect him.
  
  The truth looks more like this. That adults with no awareness of the
  usual practice of schools when dealing with sporting and artistic
  scouts, no knowledge of the particular needs of this young boy, no
  insight into the factors the parents considered when deciding to involve
  their son and no concept of the social milieu in which those parents
  were operating (St Kilda has more artists than any other place in
  Victoria) have been invited by the media to pass judgment on decisions
  made by those well across these things.
  
  If our former principal had taken George Lucas through the playground,
  and as a result the next child star of Star Wars 87 was born, would
  anyone be caterwauling now?
  
  I suspect not, and the reason why is clear. It is that, despite the fact
  that police declined to press charges against Henson after forensically
  examining the photos they dragged from the walls of the Roslyn Oxley9
  gallery in May-photos that the Classification Board subsequently rated
  PG-Henson is still considered guilty as not charged: a pornographer, not
  an artist.
  
  The bottom line is that our children are vulnerable to abuse, but in
  nearly every case the perpetrator won’t be a stranger but someone close
  to them: a relative or family friend, their scout-master or parish
  priest. As far as I am aware, no child has ever been harmed by the
  godfather of a classmate looking at him while the principal of his
  school stood nearby. This suggests that while pillorying this particular
  artist, even banning him and all his kind from our schools for evermore
  may make us feel we are “doing something,” it will not make our kids
  safer.
  
  So what can we do? The answer is to go for the real targets, not the
  easy ones. \
  According to the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse
  and Neglect, keeping our children safe requires us to know where they
  are, to encourage them to trust their feelings and to share them with
  us, and to teach them that their bodies belong to them alone.
  
  Children these days live cosmopolitan lives. The tools they use to learn
  about and interact with the wider world-instant and text messaging,
  social networking sites and what a colleague of mine calls “the
  google”-are Greek to many of us. But while this makes the panic about
  Henson comprehensible, it doesn’t make it sensible.
  
  If we really want to protect our kids we need keep our heads.

  I love a good resignation. The drama! The flounce! The sense of moral
  superiority! Better then a day at the races to watch, and to be the one
  resigning! I feel giddy just thinking about it.
  
  So my attention was snagged when the high-profile resignations of the
  chief executive of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra Trevor Green and one
  of the nation’s most senior diplomats Ian Wilcock resigned from the
  Athenaeum club in Melbourne earlier this year. The Athenaeum is one of a
  number of exclusive associations that invites membership from prominent
  professionals and community leaders of intelligence and good character,
  as long as they are men.
  
  The club’s ongoing refusal to consider membership applications from
  women was unacceptable to both Green and Wilcock. “I cannot fully
  express how disappointed I am with the outcome of the decision not to
  make the club available to female membership,” Green wrote when he hung
  up his towel. Said Wilcock: “I do not wish to spend any more time
  pretending to respect the sensitivities of…men who…want to retreat to
  some kind of boys’ treehouse where they might be untroubled by half the
  human race.”
  
  Let me state one thing very clearly: I see Green and Wilcock as highly
  ethical men. Their willingness to stick their head above the parapet for
  the opposite sex, bucking the Athenaeum’s 140-year tradition and the
  at-times underhanded tactics of the club’s anti-women leadership, is
  more than worthy of praise.
  
  But even more praise-worthy are the men who are so desperate to, as
  Wilcock put it “coax the club in to the 1970s” that they haven’t
  resigned. Instead, they’ve stayed on to re-group and continue the fight.
  
  I feel sure that, having fought so hard for the club to open their doors
  to women, upstanding men like Former Victorian Liberal Party state
  director John Ridley, Graeme Samuel, Eddie McGuire, Terry Moran, Jack
  Smorgon, former Hawthorn president Ian Dicker and former federal health
  minister Michael Wooldridge would have been bitterly disappointed when
  the vote was lost. But despite being told in unequivocal terms to pull
  their heads in, these men have battled on.
  
  A resignation, even a high-profile one, is a splash in the pan. A day at
  most of media sizzle-a piece in the back pages of the \
  newspaper and then, gone. Not enough exposure of the issue to get the
  public so hopping mad they start barracking for change and when all the
  fizz and sparkle dies away, the same old organization is still standing,
  but now minus one of the brave and principled members who could have
  forced a change.
  
  This is the problem with leaving-you are gone. However, noble the
  intentions, resignations designed to draw attention to an injustice can,
  numbers being what they are, perpetuate it.
  
  This is essentially what has happened to Australia’s Christian
  communities. Progressive Christians, unable to cope with the turning
  away of the Church from achieving social and environmental justice and
  world peace, have deserted in droves. The consequence? A volcanic
  expansion of the influence of those who remain and, as a consequence, a
  Church even more focused on personal moral issues like abortion.
  
  Sometimes there is no choice. Sometimes the rot in Denmark is so deep
  and pervasive that the only solution is to flee the state. But
  sometimes, no matter how satisfying a good resignation can be, a real
  difference can only be made if you stay, not go.

  “That was very gracious,” a friend of mine whispered at the conclusion
  of a speech I gave recently. We were at a function that my
  organization-which had done a lot of heavy lifting to achieve a shared
  goal-had arranged to thank other individuals and groups who contributed
  to a successful outcome.
  
  Earlier that week, I had made a similarly approving comment about a
  politician I had watched closely during a law reform debate. In his role
  as speaker, he oversaw the debate about a measure to which he was
  opposed. However, when it became clear that his side had lost, and the
  bill would become law, he made an extraordinarily gesture. He appointed
  the two main supporters of the bill to count the final vote so they
  could make history by signing the paper that verified the tally.
  
  Graciousness is a funny old ideal. Like an elevator jammed between
  floors, it seems caught somewhere between etiquette and etiquette. The
  dictionary says the gracious are marked by kindness, courtesy, tact,
  delicacy, charm and good taste. Emily Post’s Etiquette defines
  graciousness as the ability to handle situations with aplomb,
  flexibility and thoughtfulness towards others. Ethics has little to say
  about graciousness. None of the references on my shelf mention it at
  all.
  
  I think they should. The guard of honour that players and officials from
  both St Kilda and Hawthorn formed to mark the retirement of St Kilda
  footballer Robert Harvey seems more than an act of good manners. To say
  of John Howard’s concession speech on election night 2007 then it was
  “courteous,” gives inadequate recognition to the moral fortitude
  required-in the face of what almost certainly was a whirlwind of
  negative emotions-to have delivered it.
  
  Graciousness can express generosity of spirit, and it this that gives
  the quality its moral character. Philosopher Joseph Kupfer reminds us
  that there are more ways to give then can be measured by money.
  Graciousness is a reflection of emotional generosity, a giving to others
  of more than the rules specify they are owed. The speaker of the house
  was obligated to ensure that the debate and vote were conducted fairly:
  no more or less. That he offered more to his political opponents is a
  lot of what graciousness is about.
  
  But it is not the whole story. Think of how we use the word: gracious in
  defeat; grace under pressure. What makes an act gracious is not only its
  above-and-beyond quality, but its delivery at a time of high emotion. At
  a time when behaving badly could be forgiven, and doing only what is
  required seems plenty to ask.
  
  Finally, graciousness is a mark of respect: an acknowledgment of the
  fair way one’s adversaries played the game, and for the rules and
  institutions that governed the conflict. Think back to the concession
  speech Al Gore made when the US Supreme Court ruled-incorrectly as it
  turned out-that he had lost the 2000 election for president. “Let there
  be no doubt,” he said, that “while I strongly disagree with the court’s
  decision, I accept it…and for the sake of our unity as a people and the
  strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.” Gore’s graciousness
  was designed to calm the emotions of his supporters and to encourage
  them to respect the result, even if they disagreed with it.
  
  In this way does the gracious act impel us to remember matters much
  larger than ourselves and the partisan preferences and emotions that may
  rule our heart at any one time.

  For millennia, religious authorities have defined death as the stilling
  of the heart and the absence of breath. But all that changed in the
  1960s when organ transplants became medically feasible. In the wake of a
  Japanese surgeon being charged for a double murder for a failed attempt
  to transplant a heart, the medical profession put its foot down. It
  wasn’t long before dead patients were redefined from those without
  beating hearts to those who might-or might not-have cardio-respiratory
  function, but whose brain stems had definitely gone to God.
  
  Brain death is the moment beyond which a patient’s brain stem-her body’s
  supreme regulator-irrevocably ceases to function. When professional
  guidelines are rigorously adhered to, it can be diagnosed with a high
  degree of accuracy, and its predictive powers are second to none. A
  correct diagnosis of brain death means a patient has virtually no chance
  of meaningful recovery.
  
  But just because brain death is a useful indicator of patient prognosis
  doesn’t mean it’s problem-free. The dividing line between life and death
  matters. Death is a prerequisite for relatives to grieve, wills to be
  read and organs procured. But the switch to brain stem death has posed
  problems for clinicians and the families of critically ill patients.
  These problems include a mismatch between the way death is defined and
  palpable clinical realities (brain-dead women can gestate and give birth
  to healthy babies, a feat not normally associated with the dead) and
  between clinical practice and community attitudes.
  
  Australian organ donation rates have remained stubbornly low despite
  interventions designed to lift them. Despite surveys showing high rates
  of public support for donation, there may be latent public discomfort
  with the way patients are declared dead at the bedside and, despite
  their warm pink skin, pre-treated as organ donors (drugs may be given
  and tubes inserted while the heart is still beating). In one survey 20%
  of families doubted whether their brain-dead relative was really dead
  while another found that among the reasons people give for not signing
  donor cards is the fear that doctors “might do something to me before
  I’m really dead” or might “hasten my death.”
  
  Medicos wax indignant at the expression of such fears feeling, perhaps
  correctly, that their professionalism is being questioned but the truth
  is that we ignore such conflict-of-interest concerns at our peril. There
  is a conflict of interest between the establishment of a valid and
  consistent definition of death and the demands of organ donation
  programs: a conflict underlined by the involvement of doctors who work
  in both intensive care and organ transplantation in the establishment of
  guidelines dictating when death can be pronounced and organ procurement
  commenced.
  
  What is the answer?
  
  We need to accept that patients may still be alive yet eligible to
  donate organs, and to amend both clinical and legal definitions of death
  to reflect this. The Federal Government must consult broadly before
  developing rigorous, nationally consistent guidelines for declaring
  death and eligibility for organ donation.
  
  If we really want to tackle Australia’s low rate of organ donation,
  medicos must stop replying to conflict of interest concerns with
  defensiveness and support a full and open exploration of the issue.
  Dissenting doctors and the public-all of us potential donors and
  recipients-deserve our concerns to be taken seriously and addressed.
  
  Brain death is a convenient fiction about which medical ethicists,
  clinicians and community members have long expressed concern. We need to
  fix the problem, not shoot the messenger.

  > Our Father, who art in heaven. Hallowed be thy name.
  
  TEASE: This week, in a rare moment of bi-partisanship, the Federal
  Government and Opposition joined forces to reject Speaker Harry
  Jenkins’s call for a debate on whether the Lord’s Prayer should continue
  to be said at the start of each parliamentary day.
  
  > Thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
  
  We all know it. Hell, I’m Jewish and can recite it backwards. Anyone
  raised in a Christian-dominated culture like the US or Australia could.
  While opponents of a debate on the prayer claim this makes it
  “universal,” unless they mean “ecumenical,” they are mistaken. While
  several billion Catholics, Protestants and Eastern Orthodox Christians
  come together at Easter to chant the prayer, it is doubtful that
  followers of any of the other world’s religions join in. Not to mention
  the silence of the growing army of atheists.
  
  > Give us this day our daily bread. Forgive us our trespasses as we
  > forgive those who trespass against us
  
  Its defenders tell us that the Lord’s Prayer has begun Parliament since
  1901. As part of our history and tradition, it must continue to do so.
  “Our nation was founded on faith in the Bible and on prayer,” said a
  letter-writer to The Canberra Times. “It’s appropriate that we open
  parliaments with the Lord’s Prayer for its cultural and historic
  relevance,” agreed the Australian Christian Lobby’s Jim Wallace.
  
  Ritual and tradition express our most profound beliefs and values. They
  risk irrelevance, even ridicule, if they fail to change with the times.
  In 1901 neither Aborigines nor the majority of Australian women had the
  right to vote or to stand for a seat in the new commonwealth parliament.
  If parliament began each day with an ode to the political supremacy of
  white men, would anyone cite “tradition” as a good reason to preserve
  it? Opponents of a debate about the Lord’s Prayer must explain why its
  continued recitation is in line with the values and aspirations of
  contemporary Australia, not those of yesteryear.
  
  > Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.
  
  Don’t believe in sin? Have little truck with evil? Opponents of a debate
  have the answer for you: just say silent when the prayer is read. They
  say that surely with the world economy turning molten, there are far
  more important matters to discussion.
  
  Ah, deflection and trivialisation-the last argumentative refuge of
  scoundrels. It reminds me of how men used to guillotine feminists by
  accusing them of lacking a sense of humour.
  
  Those objecting to the Lord’s Prayer do so on principle. The principle
  is that in a multi-ethnic and multi-religious society like Australia,
  church and state should be separate.
  
  Christians defend their right to question and even refuse to follow laws
  that conflict with their principles. In response, they are rarely told
  to take a deep breath and get over themselves. This may be because we
  tend to assume that those motivated to act from their Christian faith
  are moral agents who, agree with them or not, deserve to be taken
  seriously.
  
  Well, I say that non-Christians also have consciences that drive them to
  stand up for what they believe. They too deserve a hearing and to have
  their moral concerns treated with respect.
  
  If Christian concerns were enough to spark a Senate inquiry into
  Medicare funding of abortions necessary to save a woman’s life, surely
  non-Christian ones should be enough to allow discussion of the ongoing
  relevance of the Lord’s Prayer.
  
  > Amen.

  Catastrophic climate change is the moral issue of our time. If we flub
  it, it is our children who will be denied their most basic inheritance -
  a habitable and sustaining planet.
  
  The response of business groups and the federal opposition to the
  Government’s release of treasury modelling showing the economic costs of
  various emission reduction targets was tedious. The Australian Chamber
  of Commerce and Industry demanded compensation while the opposition
  leader called for the scheme’s implementation to be-wait for it-delayed.
  
  To date the debate has presumed the existence of a conflict between the
  demands of the economy, and those of our failing planet. Careful policy
  prescriptions are deemed necessary to mitigate this clash. These beliefs
  are summed up by Treasury’s principal finding that, “The world and
  Australia can significantly reduce the risks of dangerous climate change
  and maintain robust economic growth.”
  
  This statement needs to be rephrased. It should read: “If Australia
  wants a functioning economy at all, it must significantly reduce the
  risk of dangerous climate change.” Another way to put this is that when
  it comes to climate change, decision-makers need to understand-to
  paraphrase Bill Clinton’s famous electoral slogan-that it’s about the
  economy, stupid.
  
  That the continued health of the economy depends on the health of the
  planet sounds like the “duh” statement of the year, but in a world still
  saturated by neo-liberal economic ideology, it remains highly contested.
  The argument goes like this. The economy requires “inputs” from the
  eco-system. It uses these to produce goods and services that are
  returned as “outputs” to the ecosystem as waste. The overall size of the
  ecosystem-the amount of water, land, air, minerals and other resources
  available as inputs-is fixed, but our economic system is built on an
  assumption of endless economic growth. The demand for growth has led to
  rapacious global economic growth with which the planet can’t keep pace.
  
  Herman Daly, former senior economist at the World Bank, did the maths
  years ago and discovered it just didn’t add. He argues that catastrophic
  climate change is just one manifestation of our tragic miscalculation.
  Back then, few listened. Now, with polar bears clinging to ice floes and
  neo-liberal icons like Alan Greenspan spouting mea culpas in US
  congressional hearings, some are tuning in.
  
  But we must attend to the whole of Daly’s message. Not just his
  indisputable planetary sums, but the way he makes his case. Not in the
  language of green purists, eager to wave their fingers at capitalist
  excesses and tell us how much happier we’ll be when we eat slow food,
  but in the language economists and decision-makers understand. The
  language of money.
  
  Daly says that a planet emptied of forests, stripped of biodiversity and
  covered in waters that contain no fish cannot provide the raw materials
  an economy needs to generate profits, or to function at all. “Our
  economy is now reaching the point where is it outstripping Earth’s
  ability to sustain it. Resources are running out and waste sinks are
  becoming full. The remaining natural world can no longer support the
  existing economy, much less one that continues to expand.”
  
  His message is clear. That the economy isn’t just killing the planet.
  It’s killing the economy.
  
  If the language of the almighty dollar is the only one business and
  conservative political leaders understand, we must use it to argue for
  an immediate and vigorous response to climate change.
  
  Because time is running out.

  The Bali Bombers are dead. When news of the executions came over the
  wireless I found it hard to shed tears. These men were murderers and
  tears are evidence of compassion. My opposition to the death penalty is
  motivated by more principled and practical concerns.
  
  Much attention was paid in coverage of the story of the courage-or lack
  thereof-of one of the condemned men. Amrozi was described as “pale and
  afraid” and the “least brave” of the three men. He was also, we were
  informed, the “quickest to die.”
  
  It’s easy to read between the lines. The Bali Bombers were cowards. They
  talked tough but when tested turned out to be piss weak. Barely men at
  all.
  
  Such reportage dismays me. Firstly, because it wrongly suggests that the
  murderous behaviour of religious fanatics is brave. Secondly, because it
  implies that the absence of courag-or cowardice-is a particularly
  grievous moral failing when seen in men.
  
  Is courage a particularly male virtue? My teenage son seems to think so.
  The dictionary defines courage as the capacity to withstand pain, danger
  and uncertainty. Perhaps this is what he thinks he is doing when he
  leaves the house throughout the winter months in a thin collared shirt
  because the warm parts of the school uniform are “for girls.” He may
  also think himself both male and brave when he returns from school with
  a skateboard broken in two from some daredevil stunt performed before
  the lunchtime crowd, then shares a smirk with this father when I worry
  that it might have been his head. When he grows up, he’ll probably
  refuse to go the doctor. Just like dad.
  
  It’s all mindless peacock strutting in my view. Real courage is unisex,
  a virtue of which both women and men are capable. To act with courage is
  to act after some deliberation in a manner consistent with what we
  believe, feel or know is right. Confronting a racist at a dinner party,
  despite the risk of embarrassment, takes courage. Coming out as a
  lesbian, as a colleague of mine did recently, so that younger gays in
  her conservative profession would not feel so isolated takes courage. If
  one is a homebody it takes courage to travel overseas and if one fears
  getting hurt, falling in love is admirably brave. Former senator Linda
  Kirk showed courage, with lashing of personal integrity, when she
  supported stem-cell research and the removal of the Ministerial veto
  over RU486 despite Catholic elements of the Labor party warning her she
  would lose her preselection. In her book on the subject, Maria Tumarkin
  reminds us of the courage of migrants, those who leave their language
  and culture behind to seek a better life for themselves and their
  children in the “ruinous unknown.”
  
  Gender may play a small role in courage and its more impulsive cousin,
  heroism. Women learn to give their lives for their children. Men learn
  that women, children and frail aged men come first. Mathematically, this
  gives men more people to protect, and so more opportunities to display
  courage, when the bullets start flying.
  
  But the gender connection with courage may be on its way out, if its not
  part of the past already. Women today are doctors and emergency service
  workers, while men can be the primary carers of their kids. Using gender
  as a shorthand way of deciding who should be the hero in a modern crisis
  may be past its use -by date.

  There were a lot of contenders for this week’s column. The inevitable
  arrival of paid maternity leave on the list of scuttled government
  initiatives because of the global economic crisis was one. Minister
  Stephen Conroy’s decision to capitulate to the demands of the religious
  right and censor everyone’s internet access was another. And there’s a
  piece inside me just screaming to get out about what former government
  leaders must really think about the quality of reporting on the ABC
  given their decision to participate in The Howard Years, the first
  episode of which screened on ABC TV this week.
  
  But I’ve decided to throw politics to one side and to focus instead on
  matters far closer to home. To point the bone at wrong-doers far too
  commonplace in my world-the dumpers and the martyrs.
  
  Dumpers are those who treat the wide range of people who “do” their
  “personal care” as emotional sinks. Cashed-up folk who act as if the men
  and women they have paid to train them at the gym, cut and colour their
  hair, trim and paint their nails, massage away their pains, peel and
  scrub their faces and wax their backs or bikini lines are also being
  paid to pamper their psyches.
  
  Dumpers say things like this. “I was thinking about getting a bit of
  fringe because I wanted something different. I am starting to look my
  age.” They say, “You know what it’s like in London. And now the service
  is even worse.” They say, “I went to that new gym I was telling you
  about. Very reasonably priced but it was a bit rushed. I just want to go
  afterwards and have my coffee and my afternoon but I just don’t know.
  It’s so hard to know what to do.”
  
  They say these things to hairdressers whose best friends will never grow
  old because they died that week in a car accident. They say them to
  manicurists who have never been to London and will never go because they
  can’t afford to take a holiday. Ever. They say them to personal trainers
  who have mortgaged themselves to the hilt to buy their own gym, but may
  now go broke because their wives just left them.
  
  Do dumpers know this? Most of them do, and if they don’t, they should.
  They should because finding out requires nothing more then the temporary
  shutting of their own trap, and the responding to the other like they
  were an actual human being with worries and aspirations of their own,
  rather than a creature who exists for no other purpose then to service
  their needs.
  
  Which brings me to the martyrs. Dumpers act like their most trivial
  psychological desideratum is weightier than any needs of those lower
  down on the food chain. Martyrs pretend they have no emotional needs at
  all, then spend the time and energy necessary to achieve world peace in
  manipulative efforts designed to get those needs met. How many
  grandmothers does it take to change a light bulb? Oh don’t worry about
  me, dear, I’ll just sit in the dark.
  
  Martyrs snatch your coffee cup while you’re still packing up from the
  meeting, then sigh and flounce as they do the washing up. They insist
  that that the favour you’ve asked is no trouble, then spend the rest of
  your natural life sniffing about ingratitude when the medal and monument
  fail to arrive.
  
  Refusing to ask for what you want, or to say no to what you don’t, is a
  sure-fire recipe for dissatisfaction, but that’s OK because it is the
  inevitable moral failures of others on which martyrs get off. They get
  emotional satisfaction, in other words, from being the unrecognised
  do-er of good deeds.
  
  My friend, who grew up with a martyr, says you can’t win and you need to
  stop trying. Instead, he advises, try to have fun. Leave long lists
  detailing your requirements. Dirty as many dishes as you can. “They’re

  well make ‘em work for their pay.”

  For years, we’ve been tied up in knots, unsure how to protect the rights
  of women in male-dominated religions and cultures.
  
  In the past weeks, such conflicts have been writ large across the
  national stage. In Melbourne, traditionally-garbed, western educated
  Muslim women called for action in the wake of a report by the Islamic
  Women’s Welfare Council of Victoria showing that some Imams support rape
  within marriage, domestic violence, polygamy and welfare fraud. Women at
  the conference where the report was presented expressed hope that making
  their concerns public would assist Muslim women to access the rights
  guaranteed to them by Sharia and Australian law.
  
  At the same time, Minister Jenny Macklin had decided to maintain
  mandatory income management and other controversial aspects of the
  Northern Territory intervention, despite some Aboriginal men and a
  number of white-fellas in NSW and NT branches of the ALP labeling it
  racist and against Aboriginal culture.\
  Her reason? Many Aboriginal women like it. Walpiri woman Bes Nungarrayia
  says that in her community, women and young people support income
  management because it gives them more control of their money and lives.
  Data from government-registered community stores suggests that Walpiri
  women and children are not alone, with more money being spent on fresh
  food and household essentials, and less on gambling, alcohol and
  pornography since the policy began.
  
  It would be easy to get confused. Easy to think that for minority women,
  religious and cultural rights are instruments of oppression, not
  liberation. Easy to conclude that the protection of minority women and
  children sometimes requires religious and cultural rights to be put
  aside.
  
  But the problem isn’t rights. It’s representation.
  
  The Australian community is not monolithic, but a complex jigsaw of
  religious, ethnic and cultural groups. Years ago we realized that the
  needs and aspirations of one group need to be articulated by them, not
  by members of the majority. It is because we understand that Christians
  shouldn’t speak for Muslims, nor whitefellas for black, that we sought
  to involve minority representatives in decisions that affect them.
  
  Where we erred-and continue to do so-is in passively accepting whatever
  representative such communities throw up. The problem is that some
  representatives aren’t representative at all, because the process that
  delivered them was undemocratic, non-existent, biased or rigged. One
  sure sign this is the case is where a community is fifty percent women,
  yet those who represent them are always male.
  
  Muslim educator Silma Ihram made this point recently when she spoke of
  the difficulty Muslim women have getting a “platform” within their own
  communities. Journalist Russell Skelton says Aboriginal culture is
  dominated by “male thinking” and “powerful [male] figures,” making it
  poor at ensuring Aboriginal women always sit at the decision-making
  table.
  
  But if representation is the problem, it is the answer, too.
  
  It is true that women’s rights and religious/cultural rights may
  sometimes clash, but this is not inevitable. One reason it is happening
  so often now may be for no other reason than the undemocratic processes
  by which some minority communities choose representatives, and the
  inevitable consequence of this: that the decisions these representatives
  leave the issues and concerns of significant parts of their own
  community out.
  
  From now on, we need to do things differently. When we ask minority
  groups what their religion and culture dictates, and what their
  community needs, we need to ensure the answer comes from both women and
  men.

  How much do you know about your genes? Does your genetic profile match
  that of a sprinter, or is it more like an endurance athlete? Are you
  lactose intolerant, malaria resistant, possessed of wet or dry ear wax
  or at an increased risk, compared to others with similar ancestry, of
  breast cancer, Crohn’s or Parkinson’s disease?
  
  Welcome to the new world of retail genomic testing, where all you need
  to find out is an internet connection, some spit and at least $500USD.
  
  Proponents of retail genetic testing are set to make a packet, though
  they claim that their desire to make the world a better place is what
  truly makes them tick. The founder of 23andMe, for instance, insists
  that giving us access to our personal genetic information will force the
  medical profession to get across research evidence that points to the
  genetic causes of disease, improving health care for all.
  
  The company’s website also says they are keen to “contribute to…human
  understanding” by handing over their genetic database-at an undisclosed
  cost-to assist researchers to find out more about the links between
  genes and disease.
  
  They care about our social life, too, with swapping and comparing DNA
  profiles on sites designed for the purpose set to become the next social
  networking fad.
  
  But opponents of retail genetic testing warn us to beware. They say that
  the information provided by retail genetic testing is crude and
  potentially misleading. Some companies are “harvesting” research data
  before it is ripe, telling us that we have a risk of a disease on the
  basis of one gene, for example, when far more are likely to be required.
  
  Some are also worried about testing for conditions where no medical or
  life-style fix is available. Why know what you can’t do anything about,
  especially when you are obliged to disclose the information to your
  medical insurer, who could increase your premiums or refuse to insure
  you because of it? They also fret quality control, believing that any
  profit-making entity in the business of telling people that Alzheimer’s
  disease may be in their future needs to get it right.
  
  Some objections to retail DNA testing are offensively paternalistic. The
  claim that the information might frighten us smacks of the excuses
  doctors used to give for refusing to tell patients they had cancer,
  while the assertion that most of us won’t change our behaviour because
  of what we learn says nothing about what any particular individual might
  do. In any case, whether we want to act on the information or just know
  it is our concern.
  
  Clearly some regulation is required. 23andMe gives clients their
  research reports in the context of a rating system that enables
  consumers to easily grasp how much evidence is behind the results and so
  how much weight should be given to them. This sort of system should be
  standardized, rigorous and mandatory for all retail DNA companies. We
  must also be able to trust that the information given to us is accurate
  and conforms to all commonly accepted ethical standards, including those
  relating to informed consent and privacy. I could even live with being
  forced to have my results sent to my GP, and to have to make an
  appointment to pick them up.
  
  But banning consumers from ordering the tests or only allowing tests to
  be done that have been proven “clinically useful” or requiring genetic
  counselors to interpret the results is far too restrictive, and just not
  fair.

  Defenders of torture are fond of the ticking bomb scenario. It describes
  a terrorist who has planted bombs around a city that are set to blow,
  but who refuses to tell authorities where they are. The implicit claim
  of the scenario is clear. That in some cases, in particular where lives
  are at stake and time is running short, torture may be justified.
  
  Opponents of torture disagree. They say that real-world crimes, not
  artificial and oversimplified academic thought experiments designed to
  get students thinking, should form the basis of our moral and policy
  approach to torture. They say actual cases possessed of all the features
  of the ticking bomb scenario-the features that justify torture-are very,
  very rare.
  
  There are many other arguments against torture, ones based on reason and
  evidence rather than, as is the case with the ticking bomb scenario,
  manipulative emotion. These include the fact that no less than the
  Centre for Strategic Intelligence Research at the Washington-based
  National Defense Intelligence College says there is no evidence that
  torture works. They also include the fact that torture violates the UN
  Convention Against Torture and, consequently, the moral authority of
  countries like Australia that have signed it (including our capacity to
  protest when our citizens are tortured by other nations).
  
  And the hits keep coming. As a radio documentary just aired on ABC radio
  makes clear, when the moral prohibition on torture is transgressed, it
  can be the torturer-as well as the tortured-who suffers.
  
  The program follows the life and tragic death of American Adam Gray.
  Gray served in Iraq and returned home with acute post-traumatic stress
  disorder caused, according to his mother and the mates that served with
  him in 68th Armor unit, by his inability to come to terms with what he
  had done to the prisoners in his charge while he was there. While
  training for his next deployment, Gray attempted suicide and, three
  weeks later, was found dead in his barracks from what the military
  describes as an accidental drug overdose.
  
  Those who served with Gray have little doubt about what really killed
  their friend and what will be the death of them too, if they fail to
  take necessary measures to tend their own psychological scars. Scars
  caused by their inability to forgive themselves for the wrongs they did
  while on tour and the disconnect between their self-image as moral men
  and their knowledge of what they did and said in times of war. \
  Said one soldier, “You don’t just forget what you’re capable of doing.”
  Admitted another, “I went to confession, went to counseling, I still
  can’t forgive myself.”
  
  What did Gray and his fellow soldiers do? They blasted music in the ears
  of detainees to keep them awake and poured water over their mouths and
  noses to simulate drowning. They put them in stress positions and left
  them there for days without sleep, water or food.
  
  Not all the soldiers did these things, or would have done them-even
  under duress. But as the “Obedience to Authority” and “Stanford Prison”
  experiments have shown, many more people will degrade and cause pain to
  others than would be the case if the conditions conducive to such abuse
  were not present. Indeed, as the story of Adam Gray suggests, many more
  will do these things than can live with themselves after.
  
  We need to forbid torture for many reasons. These include the terrible
  price paid by both the tortured and the torturer.

  It’s that time of the year again. No matter what we believe or
  commemorate, December offers most of us a few days off work. A chance to
  reflect on what really matters in our complex, crowded lives, and how it
  can be nurtured so more will grow.
  
  An Israelite sage living around the time of Jesus said that Jewish
  teaching could be summarized as, “That which is hateful to you, do not
  do to your fellow.” The rest, said Hillel, was commentary.
  
  It can be nice to have the take-home message distilled. When that
  message is the Golden Rule, few disagree. Upwards of forty religions,
  and a posse of secular philosophers, have a version of the claim that
  compassion and love, not holier-than-thou judgment, should be central to
  ethics.
  
  Sometimes though, the sheer ubiquitousness of a message can rob it of
  its power. It was Stalin who observed that while one death is a tragedy,
  a million is just a statistic. Most of us need stories about
  three-dimensional people negotiating real-world dilemmas to fire our
  imaginations and shift our hearts. Leaving us cold teaches us nothing.
  
  Because of this, I observed my vow to watch less TV this year. Instead,
  I read more, and watched more movies. I wanted to stop observing facts
  in my head, and understand them better through my heart.
  
  My favourite read was *The Sorrows of an American*, a stunningly written
  exploration of the big questions raised by 9–11 through the reflections
  of the book’s protagonist on the connections between his own
  past-personal and historical-and present.
  
  But the gong goes to *Lars and the Real Girl*, out on DVD this year.
  
  *Lars and the Real Girl* is not about sex, but love of the Golden Rule
  sort, despite what a one line summary of the plot-small town boy becomes
  obsessed with mail order doll-might suggest.
  
  The problem is that Lars is deluded. He thinks the doll, Bianca, is real
  and that he is in love with her. The town doctor, also a shrink, thinks
  Lars’ only hope of recovery is if everyone, including Lars’ brother Gus,
  and Gus’s wife Karin, play along. “But everyone will laugh at him,” Gus
  protests. “And you too,” the doctor agrees.
  
  But they don’t. No one laughs. Not Karin’s friends, or Gus’s workmates
  (“Wish I had a woman that couldn’t talk,” says one. “She have a sister?”
  inquires a customer). Even the church elders eventually get on board.
  “We don’t want anything to do with her,” protests Arnie. “She’s a golden
  calf. And we all know what happened with that.”
  
  “Oh, for heaven’s sake! What’s the big deal!” snaps Mrs Grinner,
  addressing each of the group in turn. “Sally, your cousin puts dresses
  on his cats. Hazel, your nephew gave all his money to a UFO club. Arnie,
  everyone knows your first wife was a klepto…These things happen. Lars is
  a good boy. You can depend on me.”
  
  History and philosophy tend to focus on great moments of choice faced by
  important people. What I loved about *Lars* was its poignant recognition
  that the religious turn foul when they forget the Golden Rule, and that
  there is nothing exotic about ethics. They can be found in the everyday
  acts and omissions of us all.
  
  I am constantly moved by how hard people try to be moral, and how often
  they get it right.
  
  Thanks for taking the time to read and write to me this year. Happy
  holidays to you all.

  Tune out or wise up. Late December and January is the season for
  think-tanks and institutes. The time where the lack of action on the
  government and university fronts leaves a hole in the news agenda that
  third-party mouthpieces for political, industrial or religious interests
  are more than happy to fill.
  
  Not sure what I mean? You will by summer’s end. Stay tuned for feminist
  analysis by Women’s Forum Australia (WFA), a group of women whose former
  and current directors have employment histories that include advising
  former Senator Harradine, leading pro-life agencies agencies and running
  educational institutions linked to Opus Dei. Thrill to reasoned and
  evidence-based analysis of current government policy by the Institute of
  Public Affairs (IPA), an industry-funded neo-liberal outfit with close
  links to the Liberal party.
  
  We need to be clear. The problem is not with the nature of the views
  held by such individuals and institutions, nor their relentless
  promotion of them in the media. Everyone has an opinion, and the right
  to have it heard. The problem is the selective disclosure by influence
  peddlers of the full story of who they are, the basis of their beliefs
  and who foots the bill for their ideas to be heard.
  
  If WFA wants the government and private sector to adopt policies on
  women no different to those advocated by the Pope and some evangelical
  Christians, that’s their prerogative. But all those hearing their case
  should also be told about the backgrounds of WFA’s directors and the
  sum-total of the organisation’s agenda so they can decide for themselves
  whether dispassionate feminist analysis of what will liberate women, or
  blind obedience to faith, is the source of their views.
  
  To offer a misleading organisational name, some selective biographies
  and minimal facts about donors denies us the information necessary to
  make an informed judgment about how much weight to give their views, or
  whether to listen to us at all. It interferes with our autonomy-our
  capacity to choose for ourselves.
  
  The influence peddlers know this. They understand that while a headline
  about conservative religious chicks opposing abortion will draw yawns,
  one that reads “feminists oppose abortion” will turn heads. They know
  that omitting information that could lead us to suspect the real reasons
  why they believe as they do makes us bunnies, but they don’t care. They
  know what’s best for us, and that is hearing what they have to say. If
  that means selecting certain credentials while omitting others, then so
  be it. All for the greater good.
  
  Third party endorsements and selective credentialing are techniques some
  think tanks, many of which are just glorified PR firms, employ to
  influence us. To get us to listen, and give more weight to what we hear,
  than we otherwise would if we had the full story about who an ‘expert’
  was, and where she was coming from.
  
  What can we do? Luckily we’ve already got the necessary paradigms in
  place. Both journalists and citizens know how important it is to shine
  the light into dark corners and not to believe everything we read. We
  just need to be more generous, rigorous and systemic in applying what we
  know.
  
  We must learn to be cynical not just about what experts say, but who
  they say they are, and to integrate this cynicism into school curricula,
  the fact-checking processes of newsrooms and the critical faculties of
  readers.

  Ethical talk about the dead usually focuses on rights. The rights of the
  dead to have their last wishes carried out, and their bodies treated
  with respect.
  
  But as the baby-boomers approach old age, this is set to change. Soon,
  deaths will outnumber births in this country. When they do, we shall
  come face-to-face with our least favourite topic-what to do with our
  bodies when we die.
  
  Current trends are unsustainable. City cemeteries are chockers, forcing
  the 30 per cent of us still choosing burial to be interred out of town,
  or to lease a space for thirt-odd years closer to home that may be on
  top of an ossuary full of older bones. Those choosing cremation will
  hardly fare better, with the scarcity of memorial sites and the price of
  leasing them also on the rise.
  
  Then there’s the environmental costs. Cremation costs us, and the earth,
  less. A 2007 report by consulting firm GHB found that while cremation
  emitted four times as much CO2 on the day as burial, factoring in the
  cost of maintaining cemeteries saw cremation triumph as the superior
  environmental option.
  
  Not that either option is anything to write home to mother about. The
  average car produces 4.5 tons of carbon every year, making the emissions
  load of each burial the equivalent of 38 cars, and that of cremation
  only slightly less.
  
  Natural earth burials cost the same as cremation, but are far easier on
  the earth. The untreated body is wrapped in shroud or unlined pine box
  and buried with a microchip or magnet. Relatives wanting to return to
  the site put its coordinates into a GPS device provided by those
  managing the site.
  
  The idea, to quote ABC journalist Ian Townshend, is to turn your body
  into “food for [a] tree” in what will eventually become a forest of
  souls: a natural memorial ground developed by the gradual re-vegetation
  of suitable space. It’s an idea that’s time may have come. In the UK,
  where natural burial has been an option for a decade, 35 per cent want
  to approach perpetuity this way.
  
  The founder of White Knight Funerals, one of the few operators offering
  natural earth burials, puts the moral case for choosing them baldly.
  “Both cremation and traditional burial are…environmentally
  irresponsible. It is one thing to consume to support human life, but…to
  treat our dead in such a way that they continue to consume post mortem
  is absurd.”
  
  In other words, we are selfish to choose traditional burial or cremation
  when a better choice exists, and our families are morally irresponsible
  to let us.
  
  I like the idea of natural burials, but am not quite convinced. Yes,
  large headstones may be over the top, but an unmarked grave seems
  extreme in the other direction, denying the departed and those who
  grieve for her the individualization that dignifies and recognises loss.
  And what of the history and comfort provided by traditional cemeteries?
  I spent many angst-ridden years walking through the one near my
  university, gaining perspective through the reading of the trials of
  others as revealed by their headstones (wives lost to childbirth,
  children to disease, whole townships to famine). What will be lost from
  our history if memorialisation of the dead becomes impermanent? Memorial
  kiosks are the proposed solution, but what happens when it all-both
  trees and kiosk-go up in smoke courtesy of a passing bushfire?
  
  It’s something to think about for sure, but natural burial has some way
  to go.

  On Tuesday, Crikey broke a story about conservative magazine Quadrant’s
  publication of an essay on scientific criticism by Sharon Gould. Gould
  is described as having a PhD in Applied Science (biotechnology) and
  being employed as a biotechnology informatics consultant.
  
  But Gould is not a real person. Her essay, “Scare campaigns and science
  reporting,” was a hoax, as Quadrant editor and cultural warrior Keith
  Windshuttle discovered to his dismay when the journalist who broke the
  story, Margaret Simons, rang him for comment. According to Simons, the
  essay contained “false science, logical leaps, outrageous claims and a
  mixture of genuine and bogus footnotes,” that Windshuttle should have
  spotted.
  
  Some journalists have treated the story with glee, setting off like
  hounds after Gould’s real identity. Windshuttle’s nemesis, historian and
  former Quadrant editor Robert Manne, was no less restrained. He told The
  Age that he had “tears rolling down [his] cheeks” while reading the
  bogus essay.
  
  I don’t think we need to know Gould’s true identity or to laugh at the
  elegance of the sting, which was designed to humiliate Windshuttle, and
  cast doubt on the integrity of the conservative ideology he espouses. I
  think we need to judge whether the hoax was fair. Or fair enough.
  
  The use of shame and humiliation to discipline those who break the rules
  and flout the powerful has fallen out of fashion in recent years, but is
  central to hoaxes. The Ern Malley scam of the 1940s saw two traditional
  poets publish what they saw as slapdash pretentious rubbish in an
  avant-garde literary journal. More recently, American physics Professor
  Alan Sokal exposed the acceptance of a paper “liberally salted with
  nonsense” by editors of a cultural studies journal. Sokal claimed the
  publication of his article proved that some disciplines would accept
  anything as legitimate scholarship as long as it “sounded good” and
  “flattered the editors’ ideological preconceptions.”
  
  While embarrassment of individuals is the vehicle by which hoaxes take
  effect, this is not always the primary objective. Often, the main game
  is the slaying, through ridicule, of intellectual interlopers. Those
  artists or scholars who dare to challenge existing orthodoxies and, by
  so doing, threaten the power of those who promulgate them. Both Malley
  and Sokal fall into this category.
  
  But the latest hoax offers something new. Instead of orthodox
  practitioners (traditional poets, scientists) holding their nascent
  challengers (post-modernists, humanities academics) up for laughs, the
  Windshuttle affair sees the intellectual gatecrashers fighting back. As
  the hoaxer explains it, the Gould essay “derides” the “very
  constructivist arguments” used in the climate-change denial articles
  regularly published in Quadrant. Indeed, it’s hard not to feel that
  insofar as the cultural left evinces exuberance about Windshuttle’s
  downfall, this flows from relief that, for once, they are not the ones
  being played as fools.
  
  But here lies the crux of the issue; the very problem the hoax sought to
  lay bare. Either what was done to Windshuttle was fair, or it was not.
  An article is either worthy of publication because it demonstrates
  adequate scholarship (logical precision, accuracy, evidential rigour),
  or it does not. If one is applying the standards of thought and judgment
  that is the hallmark of the university-educated-and one might rightly
  expect this of those who hold themselves out as guardians of academic
  standards-then the direction of an argument should be neither here nor
  there when its worth is assessed.
  
  It is fair, I think, to hold Windshuttle to account for inconsistent
  application of his exacting standards of scholarship. In particular, for
  only checking the footnotes of those with whom he disagrees. Pillorying
  also seems justified for his failure to uphold even the most basic
  editorial standards before putting “Gould” into print. Like ensuring he
  could substantiate Gould’s claimed academic credentials by locating her
  on a university website, or finding a paper she’s written in any of the
  academic databases easily accessible on the web.
  
  To the question of whether the exposure of such double standards was
  important enough to sacrifice Windshuttle’s reputation, I think the
  answer is, “yes.” Windshuttle is a public figure who made his name not
  just by challenging the accuracy of some footnotes in the work of
  historians like Henry Reynolds, but by suggesting their errors were part
  of a deliberate attempt to deceive Australians about the true facts of
  history. Such charges are extremely serious, going to the personal and
  professional integrity of these scholars. Scholars whose substantive
  views about Australia’s early history he did not like. To be hoisted on
  one’s own petard in such a case not only seems justified, but evidence
  of some sort of cosmic justice.
  
  We value impartiality because there can be no fairness without it. We
  value reason because, when properly deployed, it should see all of us
  arrive at the same conclusions about the nature of a problem, and its
  potential solutions. We value evidence because it provides a firm
  foundation on which reason can proceed. We value these things not
  because they are easy, but because they are hard for us to achieve.
  
  At the heart of the culture wars was a conflict over different ways of
  knowing. Against the university-educated “elites,” trained to use
  careful and critical discourse to make their point were those deploying
  more traditional ways of asserting authority: fear, force, ridicule,
  exclusion.
  
  Whether this latest salvo provokes retaliation, or allows us to finally
  lay down arms and agree to respectfully disagree, remains an open
  question.

  A while back a reader-let’s call her Sharon-contacted me for help. Her
  story was confusing and hard to follow, so she directed me a website she
  had set up to publicise her cause. She also sent me some documents,
  which I committed to read with the view, if I could possibly make it
  work, of writing a column on her case. I wanted to help.
  
  But this was not enough for Sharon. She wanted me to do more.
  Eventually, after a hail of text messages, emails and phone calls, I
  severed contact. Not only was I ill-equipped to manage her mental state,
  I could not provide the “rescue” from said situation she seemed to
  expect. Her response to my non-replies was blunt, with my name joining
  her website list of those whom she has asked for help but not received
  it. The list includes writers, domestic violence workers, academics and
  anyone who had made public comment condemning violence and advocating
  for women’s rights.
  
  Not long after I got another email, this time from a bloke I’ll call
  Baz. Baz’s complaint was much like Sharon’s. It was not good enough for
  me to write about moral issues without backing up my views with action.
  What was I planning to do about the corrupt use of taxpayer funds by
  Peter Costello, the lack of separation between church and state in the
  constitution and the refusal of our politicians to take climate change
  seriously? I had the potential to make a difference and to fail to do so
  made me a fancy dancer, to use Bryce Courtenay’s phrase. A hypocrite,
  and distraction to righteous men.
  
  What do we owe to others? What is reasonable for others to ask of us?
  
  I have been a columnist for over a decade and in that time have received
  hundreds of emails from readers. Some in furious agreement with my
  views, some respectfully despairing over my wrong-headness, others doing
  so in more colourful ways. But until Sharon and Baz, I failed to
  appreciate the common-sense wisdom of nearly all of them-their implicit
  understanding of limits. Limits on what is reasonable to expect from
  someone you’ve never met. Limits on the moral contribution any one
  person can make to the greater good, given their obligations to the
  particular others in their lives.
  
  Such clarity is an achievement. Philosophers have long disagreed about
  whether obligations to family mitigate our moral requirement to serve
  the greater good.
  
  Traditionalists say, “no.” The best-known articulation of this view was
  by William Godwin (Frankenstein author Mary Shelley’s father). Godwin
  said that if two people were trapped by fire in a house, we would be
  obligated to save the Archbishop before going after the chambermaid.
  This was true even if the maid was one’s mother or wife, because the
  Archbishop’s life was of greater value to the world.
  
  I disagree. Indeed, to follow the dictates of Godwin and philosophers
  like him would result in a world without meaningful relationships. If I
  refuse to go to my child’s school play because the starving children in
  Africa need me more, the very nature of the parent-child bond stops
  making sense.\
  We are not obligated to dedicate our moral efforts to the most worthy.
  Our primary obligations are to the people to whom we are bound by
  promise, affection or blood.

  This summer, Norway has quietly joined Sweden in outlawing paid sex. Men
  who have sex with prostitutes working in brothels or on the street face
  hefty fines or six months in gaol, while the women involved will be
  offered assistance to exit the industry. “We want to send a clear
  message to men that buying sex is unacceptable,” said the Norwegian
  Justice Minister, echoing the sentiments of Swedish detective Kajsa
  Wahlberg. “We don’t have a problem with prostitutes. We have a problem
  with men who buy sex.”
  
  Sweden’s first attempts to move away from a liberal, harm-minimisation
  approach to prostitution began in 1997. Then, everyone laughed. No one
  is laughing now, with a number of EU countries having either adopted
  elements of the recriminalisation approach, or considering doing so in
  the future. Australia could be next. The “women-as-victim” paradigm on
  which recriminalisation is based is the brain-child of radical English
  feminist Sheila Jeffreys, now based in Melbourne, and is supported by
  conservative Christian groups like Women’s Forum Australia and the
  Australian Christian Lobby.
  
  Prostitution and substance-abuse pose significant policy dilemmas for
  liberal democratic societies. This is because the foundational claim of
  such political cultures-that competent, rational citizens are entitled
  to make their own decisions, even if we think they are wrong-clash with
  the widely shared view that some choices are not just mistaken, but
  harmful for those involved and for society at large. Recriminalisation
  capitalises on this conundrum in two ways.
  
  Firstly, by conflating things that should remain separate to make the
  problem seem larger, and the harms greater, than they are. Making paid,
  consensual sex in a legal brothel the same as sex slavery; the one-time
  use by a student of marijuana as no different to heroin addiction.
  Secondly, by manipulating our reflexive sympathy for the vulnerable into
  agreement that for some people, choice is a hazard, and so need not be
  defended. Instead, we just need to say, “no.”
  
  I’m not convinced. Prohibitionist rhetoric and policy has a lousy track
  record, no matter how desperately radical feminists and conservative
  Christians join forces to convince us otherwise. Sure, it may work for
  some people in some cases, but the resistant rump are just forced
  underground, attracting both shame and stigma as they descend. Like it
  or not, substance use and paid sex will always be with us. Criminalising
  them just makes it harder for harm minimisation policies aimed at
  preventing the transmission of HIV/AIDS and minimising the risk of
  violence to succeed.
  
  Just as worrying is the harm caused to those that the new approach
  reinscribes as victims. The language is telling. Liberals speak of sex
  workers and drug users. Paternalists describe prostituted women and
  addicts-adults incapable of making good choices and so requiring legal
  rescue from their consequences.
  
  Women, in particular should beware. Professor Jeffreys says the
  subjugation of the prostituted woman is a microcosm of all women’s
  domination by men. She faults straight sex, which she sees as the means
  by which men maintain power over women and perpetuate the patriarchy,
  which explains her belief that real feminists must be lesbians. What
  social re-jigs might be required to resist such subjugation is anyone’s
  guess, though I’m sure it will be for our own good.
  
  And here lies the problem. Exploited people - women, drug-users - may
  deserve our pity, but they don’t deserve our trust. We need to empower
  people to make better choices, not deny them any chance to control their
  lives.

  British and American parents are about to get it, and Australian parents
  may want it too. Electronic babysitting, using a hard-to-remove
  wristwatch device with a GPS chip, is coming to a retail and online
  outlets soon. Want your tubby daughter to walk to primary school, but
  need assurance she’s arrived safely? Have reason to doubt your year 9
  son’s insistence he is spending Saturday night at a friend’s house?
  Child location devices offer peace of mind to any parent with a mobile
  phone or computer.
  
  But at what cost? Some condemn the devices for letting parents to
  abdicate their responsibilities to technology. Others are concerned
  about child privacy.
  
  The parental irresponsibility charge is inane. The parents of my
  generation used to ring the houses we claimed to be at to check our
  stories. Were they negligent, too? Surely the issue isn’t the legitimacy
  of using technology—be it telephone or GPS device—to help parents
  achieve their aims, but the appropriateness of those aims in the first
  place. The real question is whether parents should be monitoring their
  kids at all.
  
  Where young children are concerned, the answer is clearly yes. Children
  lack the experience and wisdom to accurately judge their own best
  interests. We don’t make them accountable for their choices because of
  this, even when they end in tragedy. But those without responsibilities
  also lack rights. This means that if a parent feels they need a locator
  device to keep their child safe, they are within their legal and moral
  rights to use one.
  
  Teenagers are different. The decision-making competency presumed in
  adults does not instantly spring into being when a child turns 16, 18 or
  21. Some 14 year olds may have sufficient understanding of relevant
  facts, implications and consequences to decide most things for
  themselves, while a handful of 21 year olds will lack the competency to
  decide much without guidance.
  
  This truth compels medicos to assess the competency of juveniles on a
  case-by-case basis. To ask whether the juvenile before them has the
  maturity to make the particular choice they face without parental
  involvement.
  
  This suggests that parents should also consider in each instance whether
  fitting their teen with a locator device is wise. To ask every time
  whether their teen has sufficient intelligence to decide for herself
  where she will go and when she will return, and can be trusted at her
  word.
  
  The question of trust is at the heart of the dilemma posed by child
  locator devices. One that pits short-term parental objectives—to keep
  children safe and in control—against long-term ones, like how to deliver
  the world a morally responsible adult.
  
  Our moral development, like our physical development, proceeds in
  predictable stages roughly correlated to age. By adolescence, most
  western kids believe that what “everyone” says and does is what’s right.
  Parents hoping to mature their child to the next stage, where they
  understand the pre-eminence of society’s rules and precepts, must
  progressively untie the apron strings so their child can roam free, even
  if they stumble or fall.
  
  That said, there is no cause for moral panic about child location
  devices. Like the technologies that have preceded it, it is simply one
  tool in the parental armoury for raising morally mature kids and—like
  all such tools—is nothing a determined kid can’t get around.
  
  We just need to remember that when it comes to raising responsible kids,
  there’s no substitute for the freedom to make mistakes.

  For Labor, the problem seems grim. Foreign Affairs Minister Stephen
  Smith can either follow the lead of the Obama administration in lifting
  Australia’s version of the global gag rule, or ensure we remain the only
  country in the world that limits its foreign aid in this way.
  
  What is the global gag? In Australia, they are policy guidelines
  instituted by the Howard Government in exchange for anti-choice Senator
  Brian Harradine’s vote to partially privatize Telstra, that deny
  development aid monies to organizations that offer women full and honest
  advice about all forms of contraception and abortion, or access to safe
  services.
  
  If Smith lifts the gag (and he can do so administratively, no new
  legislation is required) he puts Labor’s own conservative Christian
  members off side, and alienates Family First Senator Stephen Fielding,
  who believes that his opposition faith-based opposition to safe abortion
  and most modern contraception is a sound basis for denying women in
  developing countries information about, and access to such services,
  even when they are legal.
  
  If the Minister keeps the gag tight, he makes you and I-taxpayers whose
  funds are being diverted from legitimate family planning programs to
  church-approved ones that teach abstinence and “natural” family planning
  methods proven not to work-complicit in the suffering and death of women
  in the developing world. Suffering and death caused by continual forced
  pregnancies, and the horrific consequences of unsafe abortion, including
  sterility and the orphaning of children through the deaths of their
  mothers.
  
  An estimated 19 million unsafe abortions are carried out each year in
  developing countries. According to UNICEF, unsafe self-inflicted methods
  include the consumption of detergents, strong tea, alcohol mixes and
  malaria tablets, as well as the insertion of knitting needles, sharpened
  reeds and clothes hangers. Unqualified providers also carry out
  procedures, usually in unregulated and unsanitary conditions.
  
  The result? 68,000 women die each year from unsafe abortion, with
  hundreds of thousands more are injured or maimed. \
  According to IPAS, an international organization dedicated to preventing
  abortion-related deaths, more than 500,000 women have died from unsafe
  abortions during the eight years of the last Bush administration, which
  re-imposed the gag the moment it took office.
  
  The gag rule puts blood on our hands.
  
  Deaths from unsafe abortion are entirely preventable, but they cannot be
  prevented if the 200 million women the United Nations estimates want to
  delay or avoid pregnancy are denied access to comprehensive information
  about pregnancy prevention, and access to contraception and safe
  abortion. They can be prevented, according to Shalini Nataraj of the
  Global Fund for Women, with funding for holistic, culturally appropriate
  and realistic reproductive health programs that tell women the whole
  truth about their options, and offer them modern medical help to
  implement their choices.
  
  So which way will Smith jump? The truth is, no one knows. He has been
  “considering” the issue since the Parliamentary Group on Population and
  Development delivered a comprehensive report recommending the ban be
  lifted more than a year ago. To those keen for a decision to be made
  sooner rather than later, he had this to say. “We’ll do it in our own
  time. We’re not going to be driven by the decision that President Obama
  has made.”
  
  But with unsafe abortion causing 13 percent of all maternal deaths
  worldwide, many in our region, I’d say the matter is urgent.
  
  If you agree, you might want to give Smith’s office a call, or send an
  email, to let him know it’s time.

  Philosophers struggle to define love, little less explain it in ways we
  all crave. Ways that allow us to find and to nurture it, so as we
  journey through life - with the same lover or someone different - it
  will continue to flourish.
  
  Excuses for this vary, but some put it down to love’s furry edge. Love
  is the “ejection” of irrational emotion, so beyond the grasp of reason.
  Indeed, many philosophers believe this to be true of all emotions, which
  they see as irrelevant, even hostile, to morality.
  
  I say rubbish. Intimate partnerships run in seven-year cycles. Those
  with the wisdom to choose the right person, then make the relationship
  anew every few years, are a repository of considered good sense, not to
  mention the happiest and most compassionate folk around. Here’s what
  I’ve learned from some of them.
  
  \_One person can never meet all your needs (and this means sex, too)\_
  
  Every relationship will leave you wanting somewhere. When applied to
  friends, this often goes without notice. So Marla loves bad music, and
  Andrew hates cats. That’s them, and that’s life. But when lovers
  disappoint us, we can grow bitter. Even depressed. They’re supposed to
  be our everything! But they can’t be. No one can.
  
  It is the exclusivity of intimate partnerships in Anglo countries (the
  French do it differently) that torpedoes loving partnerships that might
  otherwise survive. If what our partner wasn’t could be treated with
  equanimity rather than as a threat - because we were free to get those
  needs met elsewhere - why would we leave, or sneak behind their backs?
  We don’t do either to our friends.
  
  *Loving others means loving yourself*
  
  Oh, I know it sounds like a fairy bumper sticker, but if you understood
  the first point, you’ll know that it’s true.
  
  Coming to terms with what your partner lacks is one thing. Having to
  accept the same about yourself - that you cannot give him everything -
  is something else again. To do it requires considerable resilience and
  self-esteem. The sort of bullet-proof self-love that means you don’t
  take her preference to holiday with friends as evidence you’re no fun to
  be with, or that he no longer desires you as proof that you’re rank.
  
  This is challenging stuff, and not for the faint-hearted. No wonder so
  many cling to the traditional ’til-death-do-us-part. But if we really
  love ourselves and love the other, we want for them what they seek for
  themselves, glorying like a mother in their joy and pleasure, even when
  someone else caused it, and we weren’t there to see it. We wish them to
  have what want in this world even if, for a time, it’s someone else.
  
  *If you love someone, set them free*
  
  Wisdom, or the dubious advice of a seagull? Whatever the case, to me it
  makes sense. Because if lasting love can’t be jealous or exclusive, then
  it must be chosen, and chosen again. I love you because you make my
  heart beat faster; I love you because of how you make me feel about
  myself. I love you because you’re the sort of person I want to parent my
  children. I love you because I respect and trust you. After all we’ve
  seen and done together, you’ve never let me down.
  
  No one is everything. Love yourself, and seek for those you love what
  they seek for themselves. Set your beloved free, and perhaps he’ll soon
  come back.

  It wasn’t true then, and it still isn’t now. In fact, it’s a big, fat
  porky pie. I’m talking about women’s rights and the scary potential
  that, however flaccidly they are enshrined in law now, things are about
  to get worse.
  
  Remember the salad days? When multiculturalism, terrorism and the
  so-called clash of civilizations were front page news? I do. I remember
  in particular because of the astonishing conga line of fair, fat and
  fiftyish politicians who paraded themselves before the cameras to
  declare that at the heart of the difference between the progressive,
  Christian west and the backwards civilizations of the east, was the
  different value we placed on equality between the sexes.
  
  Ha! Gender sympathy, little less equity, remains a pipe dream in
  contemporary Australia. Despite the premature rush of celebrations among
  women when the long-awaited ass-end of Howard and Tony Abbott pulled
  into view, so far the Rudd government has fared little better.
  
  Take maternity leave. Now you almost have it, now you don’t. After
  promising it to working parents for years, and despite bucketloads of
  cash being splashed around town, the provision of a small but vital
  payment to working parents appears to be the one promise the Government
  is willing to break.
  
  But the paid parental leave fiasco pales in comparison to the slap women
  are likely to get from the consultation currently taking place on a
  national Bill of Rights. Rudd showed his hand early on this, appointing
  a Catholic Priest, Father Frank Brennan, as chair. Since then, Brennan
  has been scratching his head over how to produce a secular charter
  enumerating the freedoms and responsibilities of all Australian citizens
  that fits with his Church’s view that in the Kingdom of God, some are
  more equal than others.
  
  Predictably, the lunar religious right has been out in force as the
  Human Rights caravan tours the country, proffering advice to the Priest
  about how the unreasonable entitlement religious organizations currently
  enjoy to discriminate against women and gays with impunity can be
  further entrenched in law. Just imagine a university or corporation
  citing gender or sexual orientation as justification for denying some of
  their employees’ senior roles, or any job at all. It would never happen,
  yet in Australia, religious institutions and the schools they run do it
  everyday.
  
  Stay tuned for a charter that waxes lyrical about the value of religious
  and cultural freedoms (read, the rights of men at the helm of
  ecclesiastical and ethnic communities to discriminate against gays and
  women), but is more reticent about the importance of bodily security and
  control, and of not being discriminated against in the exercise of one’s
  conscience or faith (read, the rights of gays and women to the same
  basic freedoms as everyone else).
  
  Where are the female fiddlers in Rudd’s cabinet while women’s rights and
  opportunities burn? Absent without leave, as near as I can tell.
  Apparently, just seeing them in there, playing ball with the big boys,
  is meant to reassure us that feminism is not dead. That any of them
  might use their power to serve their convictions is clearly beyond the
  brief. Indeed, it was Gillard who was left to explain why a modest,
  well-considered entitlement for working parents that could be funded for
  a fraction of the stimulus package that was announced at Christmas was
  not a government “priority.”
  
  Gender equity a core Australian value. Please, don’t make me laugh.

  We expect a lot of our media. Not more than we should, but a decent
  amount, often without either acknowledging the importance of a free
  press to democracy, or the structural factors that can get in the way of
  well-meaning journalists doing the right thing.
  
  In the hot seat this week has been media coverage of the Victorian
  bushfires. Less then a week into the tragedy, some journalists were
  accusing their colleagues of peddling “grief porn,” while others were
  dirty on the quality of the saturation coverage, and the motivations
  behind it. Public self-flagellation turned to high farce when Fairfax
  columnist Ross Gittens laid blame for much journalistic excess at the
  public’s door, which he claimed “enjoys” a “good natural disaster” and
  relies on the media to give their feelings of sympathy, sorrow and grief
  “a good workout.”
  
  I come to both praise the media, and to bury it.
  
  The media plays a critical role in disseminating information in a
  crisis. Our media, in particular the ABC, did an excellent job of
  keeping Victorians informed. Rolling coverage of the location of fires,
  and threat warnings by the CFA, were essential for bush-dwellers needing
  to decide whether to prepare, stay and defend or leave early. Indeed, a
  community meeting at Kinglake, one of the communities devastated by the
  blaze, agreed that, “99% of the coverage had been great.”
  
  Does this mean that no reporters or news outlets ever stepped over the
  line? Of course they did but everyone makes mistakes, and all
  professions have their bottom-feeders. Perhaps sadly, journalism is no
  different.
  
  Now the burial. The most irksome aspect of the bush-fire coverage is the
  public navel-gazing currently being undertaken by the media about the
  way it has covered the disaster. There’s nothing wrong with the media
  using the media to yak about itself. It’s an important and powerful
  institution and the way it goes about its business is a matter of public
  concern. Rather, what worries me about the public self-flagellation is
  that it will not solve the problem. Indeed, over-rating the importance
  of such full-frontal introspection might deter the deliberate and
  concerted action needed to actually fix the problem.
  
  So what should we be doing?
  
  We need to accept that we can change. All we need is the will, and a
  decision to convene a round-table, with media representatives, relevant
  government departments, disaster relief organizations and trauma
  experts, to develop guidelines for reporting on disasters and strategies
  for getting the media to adhere to such rules in their day-to-day work.
  
  There are precedents for such an approach. Several years ago, concerns
  surfaced about the risks posed to vulnerable members of the community by
  careless media reporting of suicide. In response, a number of considered
  and practical guidelines were developed to assist media organisations to
  understand the potential for harm, and how their reporting could avoid
  it. Many Australian journalists are exposed to the guidelines during
  their training or when they first hit the newsroom and, by and large,
  media organs honour them in the observance rather than the breech.
  
  Disasters have terrible, but similar contours. We need a code of conduct
  for reporting on such happenings that is ethical, relevant and workable.
  That attempts to balance the media’s obligations to inform people about
  what goes on in their name and in their midst, against the risk of harm
  that some sorts of reporting can cause to those at the epicenter of a
  disaster, and those watching on.

  I was centimeters away from death or serious injury. Millimeters, even.
  The woman in the car hadn’t meant any harm. She had only just parked and
  was now hurrying on her way, probably wondering if she had enough coins
  in her wallet for the meter, if the space she’d just backed into was
  truly legal, and if she still had time to avoid being late.
  
  But I was on a bike and when her door flung open, I had only seconds to
  apply the breaks. I screamed. She apologized. Another day commuting to
  work in the city.
  
  I ride my bike most places these days. It’s good for my health, my
  wallet and the environment. Some bike-riders are as bad as
  ex-smokers-insufferable, morally over-inflated bores. I try not to be
  one of those. I know that not everyone can ride, and few can ride all
  the time. This afternoon, my kids have footy training and I’ll use the
  car.
  
  But more people are cycling these days. Not for recreation - though this
  is happening too-but to get where they’re going. Since 2001, there’s
  been a nearly 30% average increase in Australians cycling to work. An
  increase in commuter cyclists benefits us all. One less sweaty body in
  the tram or train; one less car clogging up the road at peak hour; one
  less person straining the public health system with a physical or mental
  health problem that regular exercise might have prevented; one less
  person contributing to air and noise pollution, road trauma and
  congestion in our capital cities; one less person emitting greenhouse
  gases that contribute to dangerous climate change-and the list goes on.
  
  Yet the support of Australian governments of all persuasions for
  bringing Australia’s commuter cycling infrastructure into the 21st
  century ranges from paltry to piss-weak. My near-death experience would
  almost certainly have been avoided if I had been traveling in a
  Copenhagen-style lane, commuter paths ubiquitous in the city that gives
  them their name, which keep cyclists separate from moving traffic. I
  also owe several close calls to what I call magician lanes: bike lanes
  that simply disappear in the middle of four-lane traffic and magically
  reappear further down the road. What do they expect us to do,
  de-materilise?
  
  But Copenhagen lanes are scarcer than hen’s teeth in Australian capital
  cities and magician lanes far too common. The consequence is that more
  people than necessary risk fright, injury and even death when riding,
  and that men will continue to make up the majority of those cycling to
  work because most women refuse to consider commuting an extreme sport.
  
  Why is Australia’s biking infrastructure so poor? The answer is that
  despite regular calls for us to reduce the size of our waists and our
  carbon footprint, few governments have been willing to show commuter
  cyclists the money. Melbourne is the happiest story, and it has only
  completed 35% of the bike network begun in the early 1990s. Sydney is
  amongst the saddest. Despite having many of the factors know to
  encourage cycling-congested roads, short distances between destinations,
  high parking costs-fewer Sydney-siders than residents of most other
  Australian cities cycle to work because the city’s infrastructure is so
  poor.
  
  What can you do? Ride when you can. There’s safety in numbers and we
  need your voice in the chorus for change. When you drive and park, watch
  out for cyclists.
  
  Be part of the solution, whether you’re in four wheels, or on two.

  The rugby and footy season have begun. I know, because allegations of
  sexual violence are in the news.
  
  The charge of sexual assault against Manly Sea Eagles’ poster boy Brett
  Stewart is now a matter for the courts. A jury of Stewart’s peers will
  decide the 24 year-old’s fate next month.
  
  But the way the NRL and other codes manage the sickeningly regular cycle
  of incident and accusation that punctuate each season remains a
  legitimate topic of debate.
  
  In think both past and present club management have a case to answer.
  Why are consequences for players still being meted out on a case-by-case
  basis? Where is the policy for handling such incidents-endorsed by
  league, club and association alike-that ensures openness, accountability
  and consistency of response? Why must key figures persist in making
  statements that betray the most appalling lack of insight into the
  causes of sexual violence, and its impact on victims?
  
  Take former NSW Origin coach Phil Gould, who used breaking news about
  Stewart to re-issue his call for alcohol to be banned during the season.
  “These blokes need to be saved from themselves,” said Gould. “Careers
  and reputations are being left in tatters over a moment’s weakness or
  ill-discipline.” A few days later, NRL chief executive David Gallop
  blamed alcohol again when standing Stewart down.
  
  Weakness and ill discipline do not cause sexual assault. Retrograde
  attitudes about women and the acceptability of violence do. While the
  strain on the careers and reputations of the accused are a concern,
  surely anyone counting the costs of sexual violence should mention
  women, too. Alcohol loosens inhibitions, but unless you are the kind of
  bloke who is barely containing an urge to punch a woman, or force her to
  have sex, too much drink won’t make you a danger to anyone.
  
  The real source of sexual violence in male sporting codes is the
  attitudes many elites athletes have about women and sex, and their sense
  of entitlement to both. These attitudes are shared and perpetuated by
  the men who advise, coach, treat and manage players.
  
  Male sporting culture is much as it ever was. Young, alpha-males with an
  over-inflated sense of their own importance and capacities being swarmed
  at every opportunity by fawning women keen to add a notch to their belt
  by bedding a star.
  
  What has changed is the attitudes women, and some sections of society,
  have about the legitimacy and limits of such engagements. Once such
  women might have been labeled groupies or whores looking to bolster a
  flagging sense of self-esteem or bag a husband through calculated
  dispersal of sexual favours.
  
  Now women who put themselves in the way of footy or rugby players
  have-or feel they ought to have-the same sense of entitlement to sexual
  gratification as men. They are not floozies or victims, but modern girls
  pursuing sexual satisfaction on mutually agreed terms.
  
  This conceptualization, one seemingly lost on the far-from-modern boys
  who permeate every layer of the macho-male leagues, explains why women
  are quick to cry foul when what they understand as the new sexual
  contract between the genders is violated.
  
  A fish rots from the head down. Those who mentor and manage elite male
  athletes are role models to the next generation of players. These men
  need to take a good, hard look at themselves. Sexual politics are
  complicated and this is a new world. It’s about attitude, not booze.
  It’s time everyone got the support and training they need to clean up
  their act.

  Fond of kiddy-fiddlers? A friend of the porn industry? You must be, if
  you oppose a mandatory filter on the net. Or so says Senator Stephen
  Conroy and his allies in the Christian Right and Authoritarian Left.
  
  The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy is
  not alone in his use of this shameful argumentative tact. The Australian
  Christian Lobby’s Jim Wallace and Melbourne and Australian University
  academic Clive Hamilton-who as head of the Australia Institute initiated
  this latest moral panic about the internet-have embraced it, too.
  
  Actually, those fighting the Government’s attempt to become the first
  western nation to impose a nation-wide filter to screen illegal and
  “inappropriate” material have motives that are both sensible and
  upright. Such opponents include the 90% of people who told a recent
  Newspoll that they were opposed to government censorship of the net, and
  the close to 100,000 of Australians who have so far signed the GetUp!
  petition to top the mandatory filter being imposed. Not to mention the
  civil libertarians and groups representing internet providers and
  librarians.
  
  These Australians oppose the filter because it will do nothing to stop
  child abuse, will both slow down and cock up the net, and because
  censorship in a liberal democratic society - especially one lacking a
  legally protected right to free speech - is not just wrong, but
  dangerous.
  
  IT experts agree that the filtering technology sought by the government
  is complex, and the knowledge necessary to implement it elusive. Even if
  it could be done, the Australian Federal Police recently told ABC
  radio’s Background Briefing, it won’t stop child pornographers. They
  migrated to peer-to-peer networks and file-transfer systems years
  ago-technologies the proposed internet filter won’t touch. The only
  thing the filter will do is slow down the internet and make it less
  useful and more costly for the rest of us.
  
  This is old news. In 2004 the Howard government, initially enthusiastic
  about a filter, rejected it for this reason, in favour of a website
  offering advice and voluntary filters that parents could voluntarily
  download. It is also why some Coalition senators-even conservative
  Christians like Nick Minchin and Cory Bernardi-are now wary of it. That,
  and the fact that the government agency compiling the list for voluntary
  filters recently added a pro-life website with graphic images of fetuses
  to the 1300 urls or web pages currently banned. This could go to 10,000
  sites if the Government has its way. The banned list is not reviewable,
  and its contents secret, and not subject to FOI requests.
  
  If mandatory filtering is not about stopping child abuse, what is the
  aim of those spruiking the Great Australian firewall?
  
  The answer seems to be what those on the far left and right of politics
  have always wanted. The capacity to make us do things their way, for our
  own or the collective good, of course. “We want an authoritarian
  regime,” an anonymous caller tells a cyber-activist opposed to the
  filter. “So cut the libertarian bullshit…[or] you’ll be very sorry.”
  
  The police have taken this threat seriously, and the rest of us should,
  too. It’s a cliché, but the price of freedom is eternal vigilance. If
  surfing the web had become a way of life for you at work and at play,
  the time to defend your freedom and keep the web unchained is now.

  Australian publishing is a success story. In contrast to the uneven
  product of the heavily subsidized film industry, publishing continues to
  go from strength to strength. Around 45% of general audience books sold
  in Australia have been published here, and 40% of the top 5000 trade
  books have Australian authors. Not bad for an island at what Former PM
  Paul Keating reportedly described as the universe’s arse-end.
  
  So why is the Rudd Government poking sticks at a winning game? Why has
  it asked the ideologically purist Productivity Commission to consider
  the parallel importation issue again?
  
  The debate about parallel imports may seem confused and arcane, but it’s
  one that affects us all.
  
  Do you read? Watch films, many of which are adapted from books? Proposed
  changes to copyright law will mean fewer Australian writers with less
  time to write. This means fewer books, and so less jobs in the
  publishing industry, with all with predictable downstream effects on
  Australian printers and independent book sellers.
  
  The Productivity Commission wants the Government to reduce the
  protection Australian authors currently have from parallel imports. If
  they are successful, one year out from the publication of the Australian
  edition of their book, authors would find foreign copies being flogged
  by “would-you-like-a-book-with-that” retail chains like Dymocks and K
  Mart at prices that will earn them little or nothing at all. They would
  find themselves alone among their US and UK counterparts in being made
  subject to such let-the-market rip forces.
  
  This is why Australian writers wrote to the Commission to plead for
  retention of the current law. Most authors earn peanuts. The average
  writer’s income is $11,000, and practically no one makes enough to live
  off their work. No wonder the Commission’s proposed changes are scaring
  writers to death. Said one, who estimates that changes to the law will
  reduce her Australian-made income by two-thirds: “The money I make
  from…copyright to my work is my livelihood; the way I pay my mortgage
  and eat. Proposing changes to copyright laws are, to me, the equivalent
  to discussing redundancy for an employee…I have attempted to keep alarm
  and fear from my tone when writing this submission. It wasn’t easy.”
  
  The counter argument, that changes to the law will benefit consumers,
  isn’t backed by facts. In fact, a comparison provided to the Commission
  by a conglomerate of 180 independent booksellers, found Australian books
  were actually cheaper than editions sold in the US and UK. Of course, a
  convulsion in exchange rates could alter that, but is anyone seriously
  suggesting we hang such critical cultural policy on prevailing rates of
  exchange?
  
  Even the Commission doesn’t claim that the current law makes Australian
  books dearer. Only that, in what it admits is a largely data-free zone,
  that it has the potential to do so.
  
  So what gives? This is the 6th inquiry into parallel importation in just
  over twenty years. Why keep pushing to change a legal framework that was
  updated in 1991, and nearly all stakeholders agree is working well?
  
  Independent publisher Henry Reynolds reckons it’s ideology at work. That
  despite the success of Australia’s parallel importation laws, they
  remain a pebble in the shoe of economic rationalists. And that former
  NSW Premier Bob Carr sits on the Dymocks board, and has been agitating
  for change for years.
  
  Change for the better, or to toe an ideological line? Free trade for
  Australian authors alone, or fair trade for all? Let’s hope for good
  sense when the Rudd government comes to decide.

  Australia has come a long way-some might say the wrong way-when the
  Education Minister dismisses debates about equity in school funding as a
  diversion from what she laughably calls Federal Labor’s broad and deep
  reform agenda.
  
  The Labor government’s education agenda is neither broad nor deep, nor a
  reform agenda by any definition of that word. Instead, Labor’s education
  policy approach is wasteful, inequitable and more of the same. Why?
  Because in what was arguably the most Faustian deal brokered by the
  Kevin ’07 team in the lead-up to the last Federal election, Labor
  promised parents who aspire to send their kids to private school, or
  actually do, a perpetuation of the unfair funding formula introduced by
  John Howard.
  
  According to Associate Professor Jim McMorrow, this formula helps fund
  every independent school student in the country to the tune of $13.500.
  This is one and one half the amount dedicated to educating kids in the
  public system. It is a formula that since 1996 has seen a 37% increase
  in resources for kids who attend Catholic schools, a 29% increase for
  those at independent schools, but a mere 24% boost for the majority of
  kids, who attend public school. The funding flows from tax-payers to
  private school coffers with few strings or transparency measures
  attached and will do - according to the Education Minister - until at
  least 2012.
  
  Gillard’s claim that complaints about such rampant inequity are a
  diversion from the main game of goose-stepping to the Government’s
  agenda is not just wrong, it’s offensive. Equity in school funding is no
  diversion, it’s the main moral game. What kind of parents and educators
  would accept such a Marie Antoinette style of funding? What kind of
  human beings would say, “Thanks Julia. For our kids, crumbs from the
  table are OK.”?
  
  But while the government’s rhetoric and diversionary tactics are
  contemptible, its motive are clear. John Howard’s funding formula was
  designed to create more parents who send their kids to private school
  but can only just barely afford to do so. Some such parents may
  believe-wrongly as it turns out-that a steadily increasing flow of
  taxpayer dollars to private school coffers keeps fees lower than they
  otherwise would be. With just over half of NSW private school parents
  telling researchers that they already make large or considerable
  sacrifices to pay fees now, it’s little wonder the claws come out when
  anyone questions the status quo.
  
  Howard’s aim was to fund schools in a way that would provoke
  middle-class flight from the public system and wedge the
  then-Opposition. He succeeded on both counts. There are no longer enough
  voters engaged with the public system or supportive of the values it
  represents to make an equitable funding regime a politically profitable
  policy for Labor. Thus has the foundation stone of any egalitarian and
  socially mobile society-a compulsory, first-rate, free and secular
  education for all-been transformed into a political problem for ALP
  politicians, who strive to keep the issue off the agenda and pillory
  those who debate it on any terms but their own.
  
  This must not be a cause for despair, but hard-eyed realism. To
  paraphrase Forrest Gump, public education allies are as public education
  allies do. Politicians and parties that stand up for the values of
  equity and inclusion and fight for the resources required to give all
  Aussie kids a quality education deserve our praise. Those that don’t
  must hear us roar, and believe us when we say we won’t go away.

  Something is happening to conservative political parties in Australia
  and overseas. Left-of-centre parties have gained power in the UK, US and
  Australia by advocating agendas far more centre than they are left. This
  has left the conservative side of politics floundering, unsure if they
  should stay the course or contest the middle ground by bringing their
  policies into line with voters who want greater regulation of the market
  and less government intrusion into their personal affairs. In Australia,
  centrist Labor governments are in government Federally and in every
  state except Western Australia. However, this may change with moderate
  Opposition leaders in both NSW and Victoria seen to have a chance next
  time voters go to the polls.
  
  Labor governments have been quick to claim that moderate oppositions
  stand for nothing. The pine for the days when Margaret Thatcher claimed
  there was no such thing as society; former Howard Government Minister
  Tony Abbott could barely let a month pass before without talking about
  abortion and when the Bush administration pushed the painful end of life
  decisions surrounding brain-dead bulimia-victim Terri Schiavo to the
  centre of the national agenda. The days when the extreme rhetoric and
  policy of conservative policies could be counted on to alienate the
  majority and drive them into centrist Labor’s arms.
  
  But the average Australian has no cause for grief. Instead, the rise of
  moderation on the conservative side of politics is cause for celebration
  and relief. Because when right-of-centre parties moderate, they drive
  political no-brainer issues to the margins. Issues like whether women
  should have a right to choose abortion, or terminally ill people the
  right to die-rights that 80 per cent of the Australian public support.
  This leaves our pollies to duke it out on urgent policy matters that are
  the business of government, like the sustainability of current
  approaches to public health, public education, essential service
  provision and the environment.
  
  Will the moderation of conservatives make politics boring or value-free?
  Not at all. However thrilling the men in John Howard’s cabinet found
  their constant assault on women faced with unplanned pregnancies, the
  targets experienced them as bewildering and just plain hurtful. I well
  recall the waitress who put her hand on my arm as I paid for my coffee.
  She had seen me on TV arguing for a removal of the ministerial veto over
  RU486. “You know that bloke?” she whispered. “The one with the big ears
  who is always saying stuff about abortion? I hate him.” There were tears
  in her eyes. “I just *hate* him.”
  
  The claim that moderation will make right-of-centre politics value-free
  is rubbish, too. Policies that protect individual privacy, and privilege
  the public good over narrow sectarian interests, are as ethical as they
  come.
  
  But the moderation of conservative parties is a work in progress, not a
  done deal. Those seeking to scuttle aren’t just found on the left, but
  the once-ascendant far right. Commented Margaret Thatcher’s press
  secretary about the centrist leader, David Cameron, “I wonder whether
  David Cameron is a conservative.” In Australia, Tony Abbott is penning a
  manifesto on conservative politics that is part of his quest for
  leadership of the Liberals.
  
  All this may be worth considering the next time you hear someone say
  that a centrist Liberal or National party leader “stands for nothing.”
  What most Australians value-and see as the real business of
  government-is found at the political centre.
  
  The moderation of political conservatives will benefit us all.

  A kindler, gentler divorce may be a contradiction in terms, but the
  means to achieve it has arrived in Australia. Just a few weeks ago at a
  conference in Sydney, a group of good-hearted, specially trained lawyers
  met to discuss the ways a marriage in this country could be dissolved
  using a process called collaborative family law.
  
  Founded in the USA twenty years ago, collaborative family law involves
  separating couples and their lawyers sitting around a table and openly
  and honestly discussing the range of matters of importance to them,
  including the well-being of their children. The goal is to agree a fair
  settlement that best addresses their individual needs, interests and
  goals.
  
  Negotiations are conducted courteously and in good faith, with both
  parties bound to disclose all pertinent information and material fact,
  and not to take advantage of “mistakes” by the other side. Should the
  couple go to court, both collaborative lawyers are effectively sacked,
  because before collaboration starts they sign an agreement disqualifying
  them from litigating if it fails.
  
  But what really makes collaborative law a winner is the space the
  process makes for shared experts that are hired by both parties, and
  don’t take sides.
  
  Foremost among these is the child consultant, who meets with each of the
  couple’s children in order to bring their experience and needs to the
  negotiating table. The goal is for both spouses to comprehend their
  children’s experience of conflict and their post-divorce requirements in
  a deep and transformative way. The resulting wake-up call can lead
  parents to change their attitude to their former partner and they way
  they act around their kids, and to negotiate parenting arrangements that
  support each child’s developmental needs.
  
  I am the child of divorce. My parents separated in the early 1970s when
  I was seven. There was alimony and visitation, a reconciliation followed
  by divorce, and a custody battle that only ended when my mother agreed
  to let my brother move in with my Dad. They rowed in person and over the
  phone until I left home for University at age eighteen.
  
  Around 12 per cent of children in intact families experience mental
  health problems in childhood. This figure rises to 25 per cent for
  children of divorce. Children need their parents to tune into their
  needs when divorce happens, and to be emotionally available to them.
  Conflict, which turns to acrimony as the years progress, gets in the way
  of that happening, This is why the children of conflicted and litigated
  divorces have the worst mental health outcomes of all.
  
  A 2006 Australian study found that one third of children whose parents
  reported high levels of conflict had psychological disturbance at
  clinical levels. Other studies show they are more likely to leave school
  early and more likely to divorce as adults. “Conflict in divorce impacts
  children in terrible ways,” says Professor Jennifer McIntosh. “Children
  can’t afford settlement processes that exacerbate conflict between
  parents.”
  
  A child-focused intervention in a collaborative divorce process may
  reduce the conflict between parents and, consequently, improve the
  quality of children’s relationships with both parents, and their mental
  health outcomes
  
  Sitting in a hotel conference room, listening to the potential of the
  collaborative process to produce better outcomes for parents and
  children, I felt a lump well in my throat. How different things might
  have been for my brother and I-how much heartache might have been
  avoided-had such an innovative legal process been around then.

  Tuned into the boat-people debate this week? If yes, you’ll know that
  the stress and disagreement that has long characterized the debate about
  migration is over. We all agree now that it’s the people-smugglers we
  love to hate. People smugglers, the PM said, are “the absolute scum of
  the earth.”
  
  Australians disagree about migration. We always have. Since the 1960s,
  opinion polls have shown those with more education support higher levels
  of migration than those with a trade qualification or high-school
  degree. A 2003 a national survey by the ANU found 41 per cent of
  university graduates thought immigration should be increased. Only 17
  per cent of those with a trade qualifications or a high-school education
  agreed.
  
  Only a few years ago, such disagreements were significant enough to
  swing an election. The Howard government leveraged them as part of the
  culture wars. The left aided such divisive efforts by implying that
  migration skeptics were not just wrong, but morally suspect.
  
  The truth is that Australians have real disagreements not just about
  boat people, but our entire approach to population, including policies
  on fertility and migration. While there will always be a portion of
  Hanson sympathizers among migration skeptics, most are not racist and
  react angrily at suggestions they are.
  
  I migrated to Australia twenty years ago. I was born in the States,
  where my great-grandparents migrated from Eastern Europe to escape the
  pogroms. I feel compassion for those who give up their language, culture
  and families to leave their homes to seek a safer and better life in
  Australia. I know how hard new migrants work, how much contribute to
  their new homeland, and how fiercely loyal they can be to the country
  that grants them refuge and the chance to give their kids a better life.
  
  But I’ve also done enough traveling to know that we are on a good wicket
  in the west, including here in Australia. You don’t have to be too flash
  at math to know that if too many come to this country too quickly, the
  quality of life for those already here could be put at risk.
  
  It’s a dilemma, and one that joining forces to snipe about those nasty
  people-smugglers will do nothing to resolve. Should we want to calm the
  waters around this issue-really calm the waters-we need to stop
  pretending the handful of boats that arrive each year are the problem,
  and stopping people smugglers the solution.
  
  Instead, we need to give the public greater opportunity to contribute in
  a calm and reasoned way to shaping our national outlook on fertility and
  migration.
  
  It may be the lack of a legitimate opportunity to contribute to
  population policy that sees the electorate over-react each time an
  un-seaworthy boat reaches our shores. Despite history showing that at
  least 90 per cent of those on board are likely to be legitimate
  refugees, the boats remind us of how unsettled we feel about all aspects
  of population policy. Because the boats get the get the attention of the
  media and the politicians, they provide the chance - through talkback
  and the letters pages - to express concern about the whole issue.
  
  The Federal Government has not inquired into population policy since the
  start of the 1990s. It’s high time this changed.
  
  We need to put the real issues on the table and to debate them, fair and
  square.

  Should pregnant women smoke? OK, that’s a no-brainer but here’s a harder
  one. When pregnant women do smoke, what should we do about it?
  
  The reality is that 16 per cent of Australian women of childbearing age
  smoked through their last pregnancy. Most would have less education and
  a more working-class pedigree than women who have never smoked, or who
  quit when two lines appeared on their pregnancy test.
  
  Public health experts find these women frustrating and work hard
  establishing anti-smoking health messages that will convince them to
  quit.
  
  Because research makes clear that smoking is toxic to both mother and
  baby, some judge women who smoke while pregnant as bad mothers who, in
  the words of medical participants at an anti-smoking seminar, should be
  hanged “from the nearest tree” for smoking.
  
  The theory behind quit smoking campaigns and all public health messages
  is simple. That people only smoke or undertake other unhealthy
  activities because they don’t know the risks they are taking. Once they
  do, they will stop and begin living right.
  
  If only it were so simple. The truth is that we all do things we know
  are bad for our health. We eat rich food, drink too much grog, eschew
  exercise and have unprotected sex. Habit, peer pressure, rebellion and
  cynicism about the claimed cost of transgression are just some of the
  reasons we do what experts say we must not.
  
  We also sometimes do the wrong thing by our bodies - have ice-cream
  rather than fruit or salad, stay up late when we need our sleep -
  because the certain and immediate pleasure overwhelms the possibility of
  future doom.
  
  Sometimes, in other words, we make an informed and voluntary choice to
  do the wrong thing. We know what we are doing is bad for us and we
  decide to do it anyway.
  
  Keeping faith with the informed consent framework behind public health
  campaigns means we must not only accept that this is the case, but that
  however ill-advised we think the decisions of others are, they are ones
  that a person is entitled to make.
  
  Overzealous public health campaigners find this hard. In the United
  States recently, their frustration with the refusal of their fellow
  citizens to quit smoking led them to over-egg the evidence against
  passive smoking. When a long-time anti-smoking researcher, Michael
  Siegel, called them on it, they slurred his reputation and cut him off
  from information vital to his work.
  
  Yet Siegel’s point was inarguable - that the use of shoddy science in
  anti-smoking campaigns will backfire, leading people to distrust future
  health messages about the negative impact on health caused by smoking.
  
  Which returns us to pregnant smokers. No one is arguing that that
  smoking does not pose health risks to pregnant women and their
  developing foetuses. It does and it is vitally important that pregnant
  women are offered hard scientific facts about the nature of those harms.
  Should they respond by choosing to quit, they should be offered every
  practical support available to succeed.
  
  But where women decide to carry on smoking or to just cut back, this
  decision must be respected. Distortion of the evidence to scaremonger is
  foul play.
  
  More importantly, the decision of pregnant women to smoke must be
  understood as a health, not a moral, problem. After all, pregnant women
  are like all other smokers. People who, regrettably, but like all of us,
  don’t always do what’s best for their health.

  An Open Letter to the Greens and Senator Nick Xenophon on Australia’s
  Emissions Trading System
  
  Global warming is the most significant moral issue of our time. Current
  generations still have a choice. We can act to reduce dangerous climate
  change or persist with business as usual, despite knowing that doing so
  risks denying our children the most fundamental of birthrights - a
  habitable planet. That we know this, yet seem collectively incapable of
  pulling ourselves together to do what is right and necessary, offers a
  depressingly instructive lesson on the limits of our species and the
  systems of governance under which we labour.
  
  Senators, you are right to say the government’s cap and trade scheme is
  not good enough. The Rudd Government’s target of 5 to 15 per cent is too
  low, and far too many free permits to pollute will be handed out. A cap
  and trade scheme is all about putting a price on carbon and getting
  polluters to pay. Yet the Rudd scheme is all about rewarding precisely
  those businesses that knew a market-based scheme to reduce pollution was
  coming, but did little to prepare for the change.
  
  The problem is that the politics on the issue is now running the wrong
  way. This week’s announcement by Kevin Rudd that emissions trading will
  be delayed until 2011, and that big polluters will get another $2.2
  billion in handouts seems designed to wedge the Opposition in order to
  capture the votes of the Liberals in the Senate later, on a more
  neutered bill. It signals a race to the bottom on climate change in
  preference to an improvement in the environmental credentials of the
  scheme in order to cultivate you.
  
  You must try to turn this around. To deal yourself back into the
  unseemly political horse-trading around the planet’s future so that an
  emissions trading scheme with its fundamental features intact can be put
  into place.
  
  Why? Because while there are other carbon reduction policies we can
  pursue, emissions trading matters. Cap and trade schemes are the
  cheapest and most efficient way of getting business to change its ways
  for the good of the environment. History shows that, once in place,
  business adjusts and gets on with it. But it also shows that to get a
  scheme in place, concessions must be made to the most egregious
  polluters.
  
  Take Europe. They got their cap and trade system in 2005, but its had
  little impact on emissions because too many free permits were granted
  and offsets allowed. Nonetheless, the existence of the scheme encouraged
  innovation and changed business investment and operational decisions.
  Experts interviewed on ABC Radio’s Rear Vision now expect that when the
  next phase of the scheme begins in 2013, most permits will be auctioned
  instead of given away, and real emissions reductions will finally be
  achieved.
  
  To get a cap and trade scheme, Europe bought the business lobby off to
  stop its squawking. Australia must do the same, but with you-the Greens
  and Independents-cutting the deal, not the Liberals, who say the
  government’s scheme is structurally flawed. If they call the shots, the
  fundamentals of a cap and trade scheme could be bargained away.
  
  Compromise hurts. It hurts all the more when those forcing you to the
  mat are as ethical as raptors. But sometimes in politics it is those
  with the foresight and fortitude to insist on baby steps that triumph in
  the end.
  
  I wish you all success.

  The Mother’s Day press release was cloying. The innovation it heralds is
  unnecessary at best and, at worst, a sexist menace.
  
  The product is IntelliGender, a $95 urine test that claims to identify
  the sex of a foetus from as early as eight weeks. It went on sale last
  Sunday at some Australian chemists.
  
  IntelliGender’s tag line is, “Pink or blue, we’ll tell you!” It’s here
  the problems start. Already, experts have raised doubts about the test’s
  capacity to reliably discern foetal sex. No reports on the science
  behind it have appeared in the academic literature and even the company
  admits that the 90 per cent accuracy achieved in clinical tests falls to
  82 per cent in real-world conditions.
  
  How much this matters has everything to do with the real-world uses to
  which the test is put. If few buy it, and those that do see it as no
  more than a bit of fun designed to get those nursery colour coordinates
  right, then who cares? But the worry is that in Australia, where
  abortion is a safe if not always lawful procedure, test results might
  not be accurate, yet become the basis of a decision with legal, medical
  and ethical ramifications. This is different to home pregnancy tests,
  the results of which are always validated prior to an abortion being
  undertaken or antenatal care commenced.
  
  But the core ethical concerns raised by DIY sex-identification kits are
  about more than informed decision-making. They take in the motives of
  users and the consequences for all of us if skewed gender preferences
  are given free reign.
  
  Currently, the only way Australians can select their child’s gender is
  to create embryos using IVF, then screen for sex prior to implantation.
  In most Australian states, this technology can only be offered to
  couples seeking to avoid the birth of a child with an inherited
  gender-linked disease such as haemophilia. Where the law is silent,
  medical research and ethics guidelines - which tend to frown on use of
  the technology for non-medical reasons - reign. In the past, there was a
  NSW clinic that offered embryo screening for medical reasons and to
  those seeking to balance their family by having a child of a sex
  different to their existing children but this service has now been
  withdrawn.
  
  The lack of outcry about such restrictions seems best explained by low
  levels of desire to select gender for reasons other than avoiding
  disease or family balancing.
  
  The best predictor of couples who will try for a third child are those
  with two children of the same sex, and surveys of Anglo and European
  couples - Australian data is scarce - show low levels of interest in
  using gender-selection technology. This is as it should be. Parents
  should not have a general preference for one sex over the other
  validated, nor be allowed to turn such preferences into a skewed gender
  reality (most likely, a world in which more boys are born than girls).
  Gender selection using IVF to avoid disease or balance genders in a
  family doesn’t do this. Also, by compelling couples to turn up at
  clinics to access the technology, it makes possible the sort of
  monitoring that would reveal straight away if couples were choosing more
  of one sex than the other.
  
  Home-based testing kits for foetal sex undercut informed
  decision-making, trivialise gender-based childbearing decisions and
  render their consequences - should the use of the test followed by
  abortion become widespread - difficult to monitor.
  
  It’s hard to see reasons to have them on pharmacy shelves.

  Here’s how a 15-year-old West Australian girl described a sexual
  encounter she had with three boys at a party after too much drink: “It
  felt really good at the time but afterwards I felt cheated and used.”
  
  The Matthew Johns affair is the last in a long line of incidents and
  developments - including burlesque, pole dancing and lipstick parties -
  to have sparked welcome debate about power, consent, vulnerability and
  responsibility in contemporary relationships.
  
  But regret - what provokes it and what it reveals - has been left to one
  side. Either that, or it is deployed by authoritarian forces (radical
  feminists and conservative Christians) as proof that women are
  vulnerable victims when it comes to sex, sexuality and relationships,
  who need as much protection from others as they do from themselves.
  
  Consent and regret are different. You can’t regret someone forcing you
  to do something because regret suggests responsibility and you weren’t
  in control in the first place. You can consent to something, even drive
  it, yet realise while it’s happening you’ve bitten off more than you can
  chew. Or, as the West Australian teenager did, feel good about something
  at the time but repent at leisure.
  
  How this happens speaks of the affinity between regret and our personal
  and collective ethics. Sometimes regret comes from within, after we’ve
  sobered up and emotions have had time to settle. Sometimes, other people
  compel our regret. Schoolyard and office gossips can cause us to rue not
  what we actually did but what they are making sure is the resulting
  damage to our reputation. In the rigid and unforgiving social world of
  adolescent girls and young women, public contrition and lots of tears
  (for sleeping with another girl’s boyfriend, for agreeing to group sex)
  may be the only route to absolution and a return to the fold.
  
  The upshot of all this is that regret is inevitable - a consequence of
  mistakes we are big enough to own and the policing of moral boundaries
  by others.
  
  That this is the case means the young, who don’t actually know as much
  as they think and run in packs, are at particular risk of regret. I try
  to teach my teenagers to respect other people and the law, and to
  require others to do the same. I welcome the public health messages that
  facilitate good decision making by helping them see the consequences of
  choices made under the influence. But I’m not foolish enough to think
  this will guarantee their journey to adulthood is free of risks,
  mistakes and regret.
  
  My children happen to be boys but unless we want to return to the days
  of the sexual double standard, chaperones, backyard abortion and
  illegitimate children - social stigmas and restrictions that may have
  kept women safer but only by keeping them in their place - we must
  accept this is true of girls, too. The sexual and feminist revolutions
  that are challenging rules that have governed female behaviour for
  thousands of years are only 50 years old. Missteps and uncertainty are
  inevitable. We need to hold our nerve.
  
  We must let girls know that we don’t see them as vulnerable victims in
  need of protection but as women-in-the-making who are as capable as boys
  of owning their choices and, when they stumble, righting themselves.
  
  Being free doesn’t make you wise, it doesn’t keep you safe and it won’t
  inure you from regret. It just makes you free. The rest is in our hands.

  Why would someone hold a swine flu party, a celebration intended to help
  you catch the virus? If you are invited to one, should you attend?
  Should viral socialites be shunned and pilloried, or are they providing
  a much-needed warning to those in charge of public communications about
  H1N1 that they need to think again?
  
  Our family has been upfront and personal with H1N1 influenza, or human
  swine flu. One son has taken a course of Tamiflu after discovering the
  child he takes the train to school with each morning was diagnosed with
  it. The other’s school closed on Monday after a run of confirmed cases.
  
  Throughout the siege, notes, emails and website updates have been
  flying. Official advice has streamed from newspaper and radio. Crudely
  summarised, the central message is this: “Do everything you can to avoid
  catching and spreading swine flu. But if you or your kids do get it,
  don’t panic. It’s no big deal.”
  
  Needless to say, such advice is confusing. Particularly so to those with
  a high degree of motivation to make sense of what they are being told so
  they can act on it - namely parents responsible for protecting their
  kids. Such parents are likely to be among the approximately 10 per cent
  of Victorians who are alert, alarmed and ready to act when a public
  health crisis is at hand, not the 90 per cent who are described by risk
  communication experts as apathetic.
  
  As I see it, swine flu parties are the consequence of poor
  communications from health officials to the public about the crisis.
  Such one-size-fits-all messaging might have caused a minority to believe
  - mistakenly as it turns out- that a swine flu party is an intelligent
  response to the risks posed by the pandemic. In the face of confusing
  official advice and an absence of additional information to explain why
  that advice actually makes sense, educated and anxious people have
  filled in the blanks.
  
  They have assumed that getting infected with swine flu today causes mild
  illness but confers immunity against future, more virulent strains, and
  so the light bulb concept of the swine flu party was born.
  
  As it turns out, both assumptions are mistaken, or at least premature.
  It may be that swine flu only ever causes mild sickness in those who
  catch it, or it may turn out that some people actually wind up in
  hospital or dead. Perhaps certain subsections of the population are
  particularly vulnerable. There simply have not been enough cases and
  enough time for experts to draw definite conclusions from the data we’ve
  got. There is also no certainty that those who come down with H1N1 today
  will have protection from a mutated and more virulent strain tomorrow
  or, if they do, how long such protection will last.
  
  Swine parties may also cause unintended and unsavoury consequences for
  those who didn’t attend. The greater the number who catch the virus, the
  greater the odds that those who may be particularly vulnerable - very
  young children, pregnant women - will be exposed. Doing what we can to
  slow transmission, not speed it up, gives time for a vaccine to be
  available to protect high-risk groups.
  
  It also extends, rather than compresses, the mutation timeline, reducing
  the likelihood that we will face a more virulent strain, or at least
  delaying it, giving us more time to prepare.
  
  I feel confident no one planning or attending a swine flu party intends
  to cause harm, either to themselves or others. My point is that unless
  health officials engage more effectively with the segment of the
  community that is actively engaged with the crisis, such intellectual
  errors - and the unwise decisions that follow in their wake - are
  inevitable.
  
  So what can we do? Already, the World Health Organisation has signalled
  its intention to revise its definition of pandemic in response to what
  it has learned from the H1N1 outbreak so far. The new definition is
  likely to take in the severity of future viruses, not just their spread.
  
  Australian political leaders and health bureaucrats need to be similarly
  bold in their assessment of what has worked, and what hasn’t, in their
  communications to the public about swine flu. In particular, they need
  to ditch the monolithic idea of “the public” altogether.
  
  Instead, they need to recognise that different sections of the community
  need different types and amounts of information in a public health
  crisis. Modern messaging mediums and methods must be employed to ensure
  messaging is relevant - in terms of both sophistication and volume - to
  a range of audiences. As the swine flu party phenomenon reminds us,
  everyone’s health depends on it.

  Last year an Australian woman undertook a medical procedure. This week
  she and her boyfriend will face court because of it, charged with a
  crime. If found guilty, the 19-year-old and her 21-year-old boyfriend
  could get 10 years’ jail.
  
  The names of the couple don’t matter. They could be any one of us. The
  prosecution is taking place in Australia for the crime of abortion.
  
  That in 2009 an Australian citizen can be found guilty of undertaking a
  medical procedure and face jail is a scandal. A scandal that neither
  politicians in Queensland (where this week’s prosecution will take
  place) or in NSW (where a doctor was convicted of the crime of unlawful
  abortion in 2006) intend to do anything about. Not unless they are
  forced to take action by a resolute medical profession and ordinary folk
  like you and me.
  
  Abortion is in the Crimes Act in both NSW and Queensland. The statutes
  are roughly similar, making it a crime for a woman to seek an abortion
  and for anyone else to help her procure one.
  
  This is not the case elsewhere. In 2002 the ACT removed abortion from
  the Crimes Act and last year Victoria did the same. Politicians in NSW
  and Queensland have been ignoring advice that they clarify, modernise
  and liberalise abortion law for years. This includes recommendations
  made in a report by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and in a
  Queensland report on women and the criminal code.
  
  Some doctors have had enough. Respected Cairns gynaecologist Dr Caroline
  de Costa and her colleagues are now refusing to provide safe medical
  abortions to women for fear they, or their patients, will wind up in
  jail. If other providers in Queensland, and across the border in NSW,
  are smart, they will follow suit. Because, as this week’s court case
  proves, whispered assurances by craven politicians that doctors have
  nothing to fear from antiquated, conservative and unclear laws are
  mistaken.
  
  For their own peace of mind and the long-term best interest of their
  patients, health-care workers must insist that politicians reform the
  law.
  
  Determined and resolute doctors can compel reluctant politicians to act.
  They have done it before. In 1998 in Western Australia abortion was in
  the criminal code and two doctors were charged. Political leaders
  insisted - in the face of obvious evidence to the contrary - that the
  law didn’t need reform. But when providers at Perth’s main hospital
  downed tools, refusing to provide terminations in all but emergency
  situations, and two women wound up in casualty from botched attempts to
  self-abort less than 48 hours later, the government was forced to act.
  
  Doctors can’t be expected to agitate on their own. Striking doctors in
  Western Australia had a multitude standing behind them. Supporters
  included courageous Labor, Liberal and minor party politicians, the AMA,
  family planning and legal advocacy organisations, progressive Christian
  groups, a well-organised and dedicated group of grassroots activists and
  the people of Western Australia, 82 per cent of whom told pollsters they
  thought abortion should be legal.
  
  Such coalitions are only starting to form in NSW and Queensland. Only
  time will tell if they will be successful.
  
  If not, the other chance for law reform will be if the NSW Government
  looks to history and makes a magnanimous gesture. If the Premier
  referred the issue to the NSW Law Reform Commission, then acted on its
  recommendations before the next election, women choosing abortion in NSW
  might finally lose the “criminal” tag.

  We have a problem. Despite broad and sustained scientific consensus
  about the growing incapacity of the planet to sustain us and the threat
  posed by climate change, our elected decision makers and key corporate
  players seem incapable of doing enough of what is required, to avert the
  coming crisis.
  
  This has caused despair among many of the climate scientists who
  convened earlier this year in Copenhagen. Nine out of 10 of those polled
  by The Guardian newspaper said they had lost faith in the ability of
  decision makers to take the action necessary to restrict global
  temperature.
  
  The failure was variously blamed on political constraints, social
  inertia and the psychological inability of human society to manage the
  complexity, uncertainty and enormity of the issue. “I thought that we
  could convince people,” said one. “But I fear that society is not up to
  the challenge of a crisis like this.”
  
  Some Australian scientists are similarly despondent. Having witnessed
  the failure of empirical data and reason to persuade, academics such as
  Graeme Pearman are now trying to unearth the elements of human nature
  that make it, in his words, “so difficult for us to respond”.
  
  But while such an approach is understandable and may have merit, I worry
  about the conceptualisation of the inaction problem as one of
  understanding (because everyone knows that when reasonable people
  understand something, they act on it). Also concerning is the tendency
  to define the problem as one caused solely by others, rather than by
  advocates themselves.
  
  This is particularly seen in the absence of critical reflection on the
  communication strategies climate scientists and activists have employed
  to date to provoke action on climate change.
  
  There is good evidence that the Australian public is concerned about
  climate change and wants decision makers to act.
  
  Newspaper polls show readers nominating the problem as that posing the
  greatest risk to their quality of life. A 2007 international poll found
  92 per cent of Australians favoured measures to combat global warming,
  putting them first among the 12 nations surveyed.
  
  Yet, as social psychologists and marketers know, there is no straight
  line, and often only a tenuous relationship, between what we know and
  what we do. Staggeringly, few of the efforts designed to mobilise action
  on climate change appear to be underpinned by proper national research
  on public motivation and, subsequent to this, communications framing.
  This is the case even where significant money has been poured into
  public information campaigns (the UK), and where a government report on
  climate change communications strategy cannot be accessed (Australia).
  This is particularly concerning given that poorly crafted communications
  efforts can have the opposite of the intended effect.
  
  Recent analysis of the apocalyptic headlines and catastrophic images
  that constitute the mainstay of much climate communications shows that,
  in the majority, they provoke feelings of powerlessness rather than a
  desire to act. Fear, guilt, anger, defiance, a desire to blame others
  and feelings of exhaustion or irritation are also among the responses
  the climate change message can provoke when poorly framed.
  
  A more self-critical examination of what might be going wrong with
  efforts to persuade might also consider the uncomfortable yet potent
  observations made by philosopher Sarah Bachelard.
  
  Bachelard, herself an activist, says that the sanctimoniousness of some
  of her peers can impede successful communication and action for change:
  “There can be a tone of self-righteousness, a kind of shrill moral
  indignation, in the speech of those of us who protest and campaign … We
  know that we are on the side of the angels, and in our own way we can
  fail to do justice to the complex reality of most human action and
  motivation. We get something out of ‘being right’ … (and) satisfaction
  from making those who do not agree with us wrong.”
  
  Finally, any effective campaign for change must recognise that reason
  has as little hold on key decision makers as it does on the average
  punter.
  
  In a study that revolutionised the field of international relations,
  political scientist Graham Allison demonstrated that government
  decisions are not the result of considered choices made by rational
  actors but the result of consensus building by leaders trying to satisfy
  a range of political, personal and ideological agendas.
  
  This implies that whatever the facts or rectitude of the case for
  change, government action on the climate issue will be characterised by
  incrementalism and compromise.
  
  The sooner this is recognised, and strategy and tactics are geared to
  account for it - something that does not appear to have been done by
  some environmental groups, nor by the Australian Greens senators, with
  respect to the emissions trading scheme - the more likely advocates will
  be able to capitalise on the opportunities for change that do exist.
  
  A failure of communication and tactics, not of understanding may be the
  cause of inaction on climate change. Until these problems are
  acknowledged and tackled, climate advocates, however well-meaning, may
  be part of the problem, not the solution.

  “I was upset by what happened. In fact I don’t think I’ve ever felt so
  humiliated in my life . . I understand that the president made a ruling
  based on the current rules. But as any mother knows, sometimes families
  don’t play by the rule book … I hope this allows us to have a discussion
  about how we balance these things and respect the work of working
  families regardless of whether it’s mothers or fathers …”
  
  These are the words of freshman Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young,
  describing Thursday’s decision by Senate president John Hogg to evict
  her two-year-old daughter, Kora, from the chamber. The baby was a
  “stranger in the house” and, by Hogg’s interpretation of ancient
  standing orders, not allowed to be present during voting.
  
  Hanson-Young was still upset when she made her comments, which may
  account for their rawness and revelatory nature. I was intrigued by her
  use of the word humiliation to describe how she felt, and gratified by
  her recognition of fathers as among the parents wanting a reasonable
  balance between work and life.
  
  Humiliation is the loss of pride that brings one low or compels one to
  submit. It can be brought about through bullying, intimidation, physical
  or mental mistreatment, or by embarrassment if a person is presented as
  having committed a socially or legally unacceptable act.
  
  Humiliation, and its kissing cousin shame, play significant roles in
  shaping women’s experience of reproduction and motherhood.
  
  I was reminded of this recently by a friend who supported her
  18-year-old daughter through a second trimester abortion. For my friend,
  both her daughter’s denial of the reality of her pregnancy and the
  postures adopted by all the young women at the clinic, were portraits in
  female humiliation and shame.
  
  I wasn’t sure I understood. “Had the doctors said anything to the women?
  Or the medicos they’d encountered before getting to the clinic?”
  
  “No, Leslie,” my friend replied. "The shame was about being female. They
  weren’t supposed to be pregnant when they didn’t want to be, and then
  they were cramped and bleeding and leaking milk.
  
  “They feel out of control and vulnerable and dependent and that’s not
  how anyone likes to feel, but these are modern girls, and so the whole
  thing made them feel like failures in the feminist sense, too. They were
  (she fished around for the right word) humiliated.”
  
  Hanson-Young’s humiliation had a similar texture. At the mercy of
  motherhood’s vagaries, she was exposed before her peers as not being
  entirely in control and in charge of her fate. This would have
  undermined her claim to professionalism, a standard clearly not modelled
  on anyone with family responsibilities, yet critical for anyone looking
  for respect and new on the job.
  
  There are two ways such humiliation can be managed. The first is for
  parents like Hanson-Young to cop it sweet. To see humiliation as just
  deserts for their failure to, at all times and in all places, get the
  balance between work and family right and, when it gets hard, to keep
  their struggles far from public view.
  
  The second is to resist, to insist that the failure isn’t with the
  hard-working, well-meaning and right-thinking young men and women who
  seek to combine paid work and active parenting, but with the rules that
  make this so hard.
  
  And, having done this, to demand clearer and more flexible regulations
  that account for the needs of parental parliamentarians.
  
  On Monday, Greens leader Senator Bob Brown intends to do just this.
  Brown will pursue a motion of dissent with regard to Hogg’s ruling, and
  advance what he calls some “post-horse-and-buggy” standing orders for
  the Senate.
  
  In Australia today, both the joys and humiliations of raising young
  children are largely the province of women. But it doesn’t have to be
  that way. By correcting her initial characterisation of the problem she
  faced as that of a working mother to that of a working parent,
  Hanson-Young contributed to the articulation of the work-life balance
  issue as one for both men and women who are parents now, or wish to be
  in the future.
  
  Men who share the work of earning and caring for children are the
  solution to the work-family imbalance problem within Parliament and
  beyond its hallowed halls. They ensure that the work-family imbalance is
  seen as a concern for everyone, and not just a humiliation that women
  must endure and everyone else can ignore.

  The recent rallying of Indian migrants in Sydney and Melbourne, and last
  Monday’s *Four Corners* about the death of Aboriginal man Mr Ward, are
  just two recent reminders that racism is alive in Australia.
  
  While much remains the same on the racism front, there are also small
  changes. These have come to my attention via my sons, each at different
  high schools in the inner city. When they or their friends - some of
  whom have non-white faces - describe other kids, they refer to skin
  colour in the same casual, comfortable way someone of my generation
  might refer to eye colour.
  
  “Which one is he?” I asked a back seat full of boys admiring the
  sporting achievements of a new and mutual friend named Kareem. “Have I
  met him?”
  
  “Yes, at the open day, Mum,” my son replies. “He’s the really, really
  black one.”
  
  “Who’s that Asian chick?” asked an old friend of my son’s, himself a
  child of mixed-race parents.
  
  “Should you mention race like that?” I queried one night at the dinner
  table. “Mightn’t you offend?” Both sons looked at me as if I had
  sprouted antennae. “Adults are so hung up about race,” the 14-year-old
  sighed. “It’s not that big a deal for kids.”
  
  “It’s even more offensive not to mention it,” chimed in the younger.
  “Like you were ignoring it because it was wrong.”
  
  I thought about this and decided it made sense. Discriminating, in the
  sense of drawing distinctions, is not a problem. It is the use of such
  distinctions to justify unequal treatment that’s wrong. As long as my
  children see skin colour as a trivial but useful characteristic to
  indicate which person they are talking about, it’s hard to see the harm.
  Indeed, if the Aussie look can come to include people of colour, it
  could be beneficial.
  
  But my sons are also using race to stereotype their fellow students.
  Asians are math whizzes, Jews are dweebs, while Skips excel at sport.
  Even where such ideas can be shown to be patently false - a photo of an
  outstanding sporting team at one boy’s school is littered with non-Anglo
  faces - they insist they are useful. “We joke about it, Mum,” one
  insists. “When I walk into maths class, the Asian kids hum *Stupid
  Boy*.”
  
  But fixed and oversimplified ideas of who we are and what we can achieve
  based on involuntary and irrelevant attributes such as skin colour are
  racist. This is true even where the attributes ascribed to a racial
  group are positive, such as “blacks are great at sport”.
  
  The reasons why are many and varied, but include the likelihood that
  group members who don’t fit the mould will be seen as deviant, not to
  mention having their real talents ignored.
  
  As well, the positive stereotyping of one group compels the negative
  stereotyping of others. If Asians are good at maths, then blacks and
  whites, relatively speaking, must be bad at it. And all such
  stereotyping affects real-world performance.
  
  For instance, one study found that when black students were told a test
  measured intelligence, they performed badly, but when the same test was
  presented as a problem-solving exercise, they did as well as whites.
  Another showed that when athletic performance was linked to
  “intelligence”, black sportspeople did worse than whites but linking it
  to “natural athletic ability” saw whites perform worse.
  
  Race might say what we look like, but not who we are. I will speak to my
  boys about it again tonight.

  There’s a question that’s been around for about 30 years: whether
  private, for-profit companies should be allowed to gain exclusive
  control over knowledge about our genes.
  
  Should private interests profit from their understanding of the human
  genetic code or from tests or cures they may - or may not - be willing
  or are able to derive from this knowledge? Is such control, encouraged
  by research funding arrangements and facilitated by patent law, the best
  way to serve the public good and public health?
  
  The American Civil Liberties Union says “no”. Last month the union
  launched a court action on behalf of scientific and women’s health
  groups and individual women at increased risk of hereditary cancers. The
  action challenges the patents on two genes held by a company called
  Myriad. The genes are linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and
  the patent grants Myriad exclusive rights to control and profit from the
  testing of women with a family history of such cancer, to conduct
  further research on the gene and to control and profit from therapies
  that might result from the research.
  
  If the union wins, it’s not just the patent on Myriad’s genes that may
  be rendered invalid but the tens of thousands of other patents on human
  genes, too.
  
  Luigi Palombi, a patent lawyer recently interviewed on the ABC’s
  Background Briefing, thinks this is fair enough. According to Palombi,
  private companies should never have been allowed to patent genes in the
  first place. Not only are such patents unfair (Myriad only identified
  fragments, but was granted control of the entire gene), but they violate
  the legal prohibition on patenting abstract ideas or the laws and
  products of nature. Patents are ineffective and inefficient, reducing
  the competition and co-operative endeavour needed to understand and
  exploit genes for human health and limiting women’s options regarding
  their medical care. Palombi says that instead of complaining about the
  potential loss of their genomic patents, the companies that currently
  hold patents should be grateful. They always knew they were stretching
  the limits of patent law, and the fact that they’ve been getting away
  with it for 20 years means “they’ve received an advantage that, frankly,
  they were not entitled to receive”.
  
  In 2004, the Australian Law Reform Commission completed an 18-month
  inquiry into intellectual property rights over genetic materials and
  related technologies, though its recommendations have yet to be
  implemented. The Senate community affairs committee just finished taking
  submissions on the wisdom of granting patents in Australia over genes
  and their products, with public hearings to commence shortly.
  
  The main problem for those hoping to wrest control of the human genome
  from the profit-seekers is to counter the self-interested claim by
  biotechs and big pharmaceutical companies that they are the only ones
  who can do the research and development needed to unearth the secrets of
  the genome. Such companies argue that in exchange for their contribution
  to human health, we owe them proprietary control and profits.
  
  This is unadulterated rubbish. Patenting is just one component of a
  framework for facilitating scientific and medical innovation.
  
  The union case is about rejecting patents as neither the best nor the
  right way to promote and protect genetic knowledge and innovation. It is
  not too late to unscramble the egg.

  Years ago, when I was doing a Masters of Bioethics under renowned
  philosopher Peter Singer at Monash University in Melbourne, I signed up
  to the newly founded Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry.
  
  The donation of bone marrow is not a simple or pain-free procedure, but
  I was young and single and surrounded by people absorbed with doing the
  right thing. At the time I was vegetarian and caring for a young man
  dying of HIV/AIDS. Offering a gift of life to someone with leukaemia or
  other fatal blood disorders without so much as a backwards glance was
  what I wanted to be - and thought I was - all about.
  
  Fast forward a few years and I had become a mother, teething baby in one
  arm and a toddler under the other. Undone as much by overwork and lack
  of sleep as by the guilt of the working mother enterprise (these were
  the Howard years, remember?), the call came one afternoon. It was from
  the registry. A woman in another state in Australia was sick and needed
  a bone marrow transplant, but none of her siblings was a tissue match.
  Initial tests of my blood suggested I might be able to help.
  
  Back then - this was before 2001 - there was only one way to get bone
  marrow (today, this method has been joined by another, which has its own
  risk profile). I would have to go into hospital and have a general
  anaesthetic so doctors could extract the required cells from my pelvic
  bones using hollow needles. Afterwards there would be bruises, pain and
  stiffness.
  
  I would need pain relief and would have trouble walking (one woman
  described it like being kicked by a horse). If I was truly unlucky, the
  rare risks associated with general anaesthesia, transfusion and
  infection or injury at the needle site might come into play.
  
  I’ll be perfectly honest. I did not want to do it. I absolutely did not
  want to do it. At that point in my life, I needed the risks and
  complications of tissue donation like a hole in the head.
  
  Normally, when a person accepts the costs of a medical procedure it is
  because she sees them as favourably offset by its benefits - to her. For
  live tissue donors the equation is different. Donating bone marrow
  required me to assume both the certain complications and unknown risks
  of the procedure to benefit someone else - a person I did not know.
  
  As it turned out, I never had to choose. Additional tests revealed I was
  not compatible and so the registry’s search for a donor moved on. Or so
  I presumed. For privacy and practical reasons, I could never find out
  what happened to the woman and whether a tissue-matched donor was ever
  found.
  
  So what if someone from the Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry rang
  me today?
  
  They might because, despite the anguish and uncertainty I suffered so
  many years back, I ultimately decided not to take my name off the
  database.
  
  This was not just because I knew my kids would likely be older and less
  dependent when the phone rang again, but because, however inconvenient
  and unpleasant it might be, giving marrow to a stranger is the right
  thing to do.
  
  Indeed, it is the absence of the usual emotional pulls to gift-giving -
  love, friendship, social obligation - that make live, anonymous tissue
  donation proof positive that altruism exists. And altruism is the
  beating heart of morality.
  
  So get on the registry. Give the gift of life.

  RU486 is available, but in Queensland a teenager is charged over an
  abortion.
  
  This week’s announcement by Marie Stopes International that clients of
  its clinics in Victoria, NSW, Queensland, the ACT and Western Australia
  can now terminate pregnancies at less than nine weeks using RU486 is one
  more step in Australian women’s struggle for full equality and
  reproductive rights.
  
  RU486 has had a chequered history in this country. For many years it was
  effectively banned as a result of a deal brokered by both major parties
  to secure former senator Brian Harradine’s vote to sell Telstra. Only in
  2006, as a result of the efforts of a cross-party group of female
  senators was the law changed, allowing RU486 to be regulated like all
  other drugs.
  
  A pharmaceutical company will soon apply for and be granted a general
  licence to import and market the drug. Medicos will finally be able to
  dispense the drug like all others, by prescription and on the basis of
  patient need. But just as one door opens, several others threaten to
  slam shut.
  
  The most worrying development is in Queensland, where a teenage girl is
  being prosecuted for having an abortion. Yes, you heard right. Next
  month Tegan Leach, 19, will return to court with her boyfriend to defend
  charges that he gave her RU486, and she used it, to abort an unwanted
  pregnancy.
  
  The couple seem certain to be found guilty. Abortion is in the criminal
  code in Queensland, and the facts of the case suggest the young woman
  and her boyfriend did the “crime”. That is, having discovered they were
  pregnant, and judging themselves too young to be parents, they obtained
  RU486 with the intention of causing her to miscarry.
  
  You might think that in the face of this impending travesty pro-choice
  Premier Anna Bligh would be looking for ways to help. First and
  foremost, you might think that Bligh would be preparing a bill to
  present to Parliament to reform an antiquated law that makes one of the
  safest and most common medical procedures a felony.
  
  You would be wrong. Instead, in a staggering display of ignorance and
  obfuscation, Bligh has done her damndest to convince Queenslanders that
  Leach’s situation is anomalous. Something to do with the fact that the
  drug she took, RU486, was not prescribed by a doctor or isn’t approved
  for general use. In reply to the truth - that what has happened to the
  teenager could happen to any Queensland man, woman or medico involved
  with abortion as long as the procedure remains a crime - she has burbled
  about the need for a private member’s bill to come before parliament for
  the issue to be decided.
  
  Bligh, and the Government she leads, could move to change the law
  tomorrow and should, given that removing abortion from the Crimes Act is
  Labor Party policy and Bligh made numerous backroom promises before the
  most recent election that she would reform the law if she won.
  Queensland Labor: compromised one day, craven the next. One wonders
  exactly what has to happen to women in Queensland before their
  politicians act to represent them.
  
  Luckily for women in Victoria, political integrity and guts are more
  plentiful at Spring Street. We are going to need them. After successful
  reform of Victoria’s abortion law last year - reform that means no
  Victorian teenager will ever have to endure what Tegan Leach is going
  through - pro-life forces are up in arms.
  
  At a recent conference in Melbourne, on the subject of conscience no
  less, pro-life doctors lambasted Victoria’s Abortion Law Reform Act for
  requiring them to perform an abortion in an emergency. Instead they seem
  to feel they have a right to let their female patients die. They plan to
  take a test case to court.
  
  Their chances of winning are nearly zero. Even the most restrictive
  definition of a medical professional’s duty of care requires assistance
  to be rendered in an emergency.
  
  But truckloads of taxpayer resources will be consumed in defending the
  case through the assertion, I would assume, that
  
  in a liberal, plural democracy, women have rights, too. Namely, a right
  to equality before the law and to be treated as more than human
  incubators whose lives are worth little, or nothing at all.

  Circumcision used to be the done thing. Now, only around 10 per cent of
  Australians circumcise their male infants. But in Tasmania, they are
  trying to find a way to stop them. A recently released Tasmanian Law
  Reform Institute issues paper makes no bones about its desire to use the
  criminal law to prosecute some hapless Jewish, Muslim or Aboriginal
  parents for circumcising their boys.
  
  Currently, the law won’t do it. As the paper admits, male circumcision
  does not constitute unlawful wounding, ill treatment or child abuse.
  This means that when parents make substantially free and informed
  decisions to circumcise their infant sons, their actions are lawful.
  
  But we need to keep an eye on this one. Changes to Tasmania’s laws could
  spark similar moves across the country, and the views of the man who
  initiated the law reform push-Tasmania’s children’s commissioner Paul
  Mason-seems dangerously unbalanced. “Laws protect girls from [having
  their clitoris or entire labia excised],” he recently told a newspaper,
  but parents are free to “go around willy-nilly chopping up bits of their
  sons”.
  
  Before I go further, I should say that I come from a Jewish background
  though I did not circumcise either of my sons. It was a bugger of a
  decision and I prayed for girls in hope of avoiding it. When this
  failed, I considered the choice carefully, canvassing the medical,
  ethical, social and cultural/religious issues in turn.
  
  As I see it, the health case for and against circumcision cancel each
  other out (you can argue the toss, but essentially the evidence can be
  summed up as “there are no medical reasons for or against
  circumcision”). Social reasons for circumcising, like it’s “cleaner” or
  “I want my son to look like Dad,” are trivial and do not stand up well
  to scrutiny.
  
  This leaves cultural/religious reasons that, in my case, were not
  compelling. I’m not a believer, nor a member of a community that would
  cut me off-and reject my sons-if I did not circumcise. I did wonder
  whether my sons might want to be members of such a community, but
  figured that by the time they were old enough to make that decision,
  they could decide for themselves about circumcision.
  
  In general, when parents can defer a meaningful decision about their
  child to a time when the child can have input, or preferably make it
  himself, they should. I was able to do this with circumcision.
  
  But for some parents, this would not be possible. What if there is a
  family history of urinary tract infections-a risk reduced by
  circumcision in infancy? What if the parents are part of a community
  that demands circumcision and they believe that their son’s acceptance
  into this community is key to their current happiness and identity
  formation? Isn’t the freedom to decide what is in our own and our
  child’s best interest what a liberal, democratic society is all about?
  
  This does not mean that anything goes. Obviously if circumcision was
  demonstrably injurious to a child’s physical and mental health-as is
  female genital cutting-it must be outlawed, no matter what minority
  groups say. But like Cinderella’s step sister straining at that glass
  slipper, anti-circumcision advocates can’t make the evidence about male
  circumcision fit. No matter how you look at it, male circumcision isn’t
  mutilation or child abuse.
  
  There is no shortage of those who know what is best for our kids.
  Thankfully, Australian law puts parents in charge. Let’s make sure we
  keep it that way.

  There is little evidence to support racial motives behind criticism of
  Obama.
  
  THE cry of “racism” has sounded, and the hounds are off and running.
  Since last week’s outburst by Joe Wilson during President Barack Obama’s
  address to a joint session of Congress on health care - the congressman
  called the President a “liar” - the international commentariat has
  sought to divine the reasons for the remark, and Obama’s declining
  popularity in the polls.
  
  Some are sure they know the answer. *New York Times* columnist Maureen
  Dowd said that, “… fair or not, what I heard was an unspoken word in the
  air: You lie, boy!” Adding fuel to the charge of racism was former
  president Jimmy Carter, who said that: “I think that an overwhelming
  portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity towards … Obama is based
  on the fact that he is a black man … the racism inclination … bubbled up
  … because of a belief among many white people … that African Americans
  are not qualified to lead this great country.”
  
  What is wrong with this picture? In my view, the problem is clear. The
  whipping up of national and international hysteria about an important
  issue on the basis of no evidence at all. Motives are elusive, but facts
  speak for themselves. Joe Wilson called the President a liar, not boy or
  porch monkey or coon or jigaboo or any of the depressingly long list of
  race-based insults for black Americans.
  
  While heckling a president is unusual (the US Congress is a sedate place
  compared with its British and Australian counterparts) neither the act
  of shouting nor the word Wilson used demonstrates racist sentiment.
  Sure, Wilson may have attacked the President because of the colour of
  Obama’s skin (as a South Carolina senator he voted to keep the
  Confederate flag flying above the state house), or he may have done so
  because he profoundly disagreed with what the President was saying. The
  evidence reveals nothing either way.
  
  Former president Carter is operating in a similar fact-free zone. His
  charge of racism seeks to tar not just an individual, but the motives of
  many white Americans. “Most of the animosity white people feel towards
  the President is because he is black” and “many white people believe the
  President’s skin colour disqualifies him from leading the country” are
  statements of fact.
  
  But while numerous survey techniques exist to accurately catalogue the
  depth and breadth of racist sentiment among Americans - to prove whether
  Carter’s assertions are correct - the former president and Nobel Peace
  Prize winner musters none. Just like columnist Dowd, he seems content to
  make such claims on the basis of nothing more solid than his thoughts or
  beliefs.
  
  It’s not good enough. Average Joe and Josephine have little choice but
  to make decisions and seek to persuade based on intuition, anecdote and
  personal experience. They are not in a position to commission
  double-blind placebo-controlled trials on which washing powder works
  best, or statistically valid polling before they opine about what
  “everyone” thinks about this or that. Even if they did, they might
  struggle to interpret the results.
  
  But opinion leaders, like others in positions of responsibility, are
  different. What they say can critically influence the views of others
  and the tone, tenor and direction of the political debate. They have a
  duty to get it right, not just mouth-off to get a rise. This is why
  evidence-based policy and medicine are all the rage. Surely
  evidence-based opinion should be next.
  
  The saddest part of the current kerfuffle is the damage it could do to
  the President’s determination to eradicate racial inequality in the US.
  
  As Obama noted in a recent speech to the National Association for the
  Advancement of Coloured People, black Americans have a harder road than
  whites. Blacks have borne the brunt of job losses from the global
  financial crisis, are more likely to have poorer health than whites and
  are five times as likely to end up in jail.
  
  Tackling such inequities requires a willingness by the mostly white
  “haves” to back structural change. Given the high levels of support
  Obama garnered from white Americans during the election, there was no
  reason to think such support would not be forthcoming. But Dowd and
  Carter’s baseless charges of racism may have squandered the goodwill
  required to achieve real change by putting whites on the defensive.
  Falsely accused and crying victim, they worry aloud about being accused
  of racism if they raise objections to the President’s policies.
  
  Motives are elusive but facts speak for themselves. Racial inequity in
  the US is real and must be attacked at its root. While the affiliations
  and funding sources of those critiquing the President must be revealed,
  where the sentiment behind criticism is unknown, it must be taken at
  face value. Proof only that in a large country with a boisterous
  democracy, not everyone will agree.

  Your children have a right to sex education. This right is a component
  of their sexual rights, themselves a subset of the human rights
  guaranteed to them in international laws, human rights documents and
  other consensus statements.
  
  But don’t cry out for joy or fly off the handle with rage just yet.
  Because whatever abstract entitlement our kids have to accurate,
  relevant and age-appropriate information about sex, relationships and
  reproduction in the classroom, most aren’t getting any. Education, that
  is. They are getting plenty of sex, some of it unwanted, as well as
  sexually transmitted infections, unwanted pregnancies and, if they are
  same-sex attracted, a worrying dose of suicidal thoughts.
  
  Yet, despite such incontrovertible evidence of need, Australia lacks a
  comprehensive national sexual and reproductive health strategy. We don’t
  even have basic minimum standards for what our kids can be taught. Into
  this policy vacuum comes Choices, Decisions, Outcomes, CDO for short, an
  “innovative value-based education program for adolescents” that
  “encourages responsible decision making regarding sexuality”.
  
  CDO uses foetal models and flip books to instruct year seven and eight
  students about “self worth” and self “respect”. In later years, free
  giveaways such as comics and friendship dolls help teach kids that peer
  pressure causes teen sex, which unavoidably results in pregnancy,
  infertility, sexually transmitted infections and diseases that kill.
  
  CDO is the brainchild of Jane Power. Jane’s background is as counsellor
  at Pregnancy Help Geelong, an approved Right to Life organisation. CDO’s
  core values are “to respect human life from conception” and “to
  encourage saving sexual intimacy until marriage and then only between
  husband and wife”. Interestingly, this statement of values is not
  available on CDO’s website, to which students undertaking the course and
  their parents are directed.
  
  CDO’s partner organisation, Real Choices Australia, says the program has
  been delivered to more than 100,000 Australian children. Real Choices
  Australia’s affiliation is not apparent from its website, but it seems
  to have links to the Catholic Church. Certainly, the funding for CDO is
  coming from somewhere. A new education team’s kit costs $3000, and their
  audio-visual requirements another $2000. Thankfully, we’re all
  contributing to the cause. Donations to Real Choices Australia are tax
  deductible.
  
  One mother first heard about CDO was when her daughter came home from
  school to report that pashing makes you pregnant. The girl attends a
  public school in country NSW.
  
  Pro-life, abstinence-only sex education crosses the line, pushing
  religion into the secular school system where it doesn’t belong. It can
  also be duplicitous, presenting false information about the
  “side-effects” of abortion and either refusing to talk about
  contraception, or mentioning only (inflated) failure rates.
  
  But the biggest problem with abstinence-only sex ed is that it doesn’t
  work. A report on the effectiveness of the US Government’s significant
  investment in abstinence-only sex education found that youth delivered
  the program had as much sex with as many partners, and started having
  sex at the same time, as other adolescents.
  
  Worse, when kids are taught CDO they miss out on abstinence-plus
  approaches that really work, reducing sexually transmitted infections
  without increasing rates of teenage sex.
  
  State and federal politicians have questions to answer. They need to
  explain why ineffective abstinence-only sex education is being taught in
  public classrooms, and why they won’t put a strategy in place to make
  sure our kids get the facts.

  “From Hero to Zero” ran the headline, a nice one to describe the fall
  from grace last week of the Federal President of the Prisoners of War
  Association of Australia, Rex Crane.
  
  Crane took us all for a ride. Now 83, he claimed he was Australia’s
  youngest POW. Abandoned in Malaya by his family at age 15, he said the
  Japanese tortured him at Outram Road Jail in Singapore and on the
  Thai-Burma railway.
  
  But thanks to the due diligence of three women, one a professional
  historian, the more pedestrian truth about the events of Crane’s life
  during World War II are now known. He spent it at Adelaide High School,
  after which he held a number of jobs, including running a pub. He was
  never in the military.
  
  Friends and families-including a step granddaughter who cried with him
  as he told her stories of his wartime suffering-have responded to
  Crane’s public undoing with shock, astonishment and bewilderment. This
  has been followed by embarrassment, horror and mortification. Anger will
  almost certainly come later. Those more distant to the Crane, including
  war historians and returned servicemen, have used words like galled,
  disgusted and appalled. The Australian Federal Police are now pursuing
  Crane-who has received the top pension award, a $25,000 bonus payment
  and a Commonwealth Gold Card covering all medical expenses-for fraud.
  
  Crane’s story is one of betrayal. “No Judas, no story,” says writer and
  broadcaster Libbi Gorr, and surely she is right. Betrayers occupied the
  innermost ring of Dante’s inferno and Jane Austen’s *Sense and
  Sensibility* is preoccupied with the theme. Since the dawn of the
  Christian era, betrayal has been central to the seminal and everyday
  stories that shape and describe our lives.
  
  Odd then, that we find it so hard to define both act and emotion with
  depth and precision. Disloyalty and treachery is the best the dictionary
  can come up, while philosophers do little better. As Rodger L. Jackson
  has noted, few treatments of the subject capture the elements of
  character, circumstance and motive that give betrayal its flavour, and
  determine the cost to victims.
  
  Betrayal is an assault on trust. Rex Crane’s lies about his wartime
  activities betrayed the most fundamental trust we offer those we love,
  live with, befriend and admire-what we must offer if such a thing as a
  relationship is to exist. An automatic, unquestioning faith that people
  are who they claim to be. While publicly disowning him, as his step
  granddaughter has done, may alleviate the guilt and shame society
  unfairly heaps on those associated with wrongdoers by blood or marriage,
  those closest to Crane may require professional support. How else to
  ensure the anger they must feel is directed out towards him, rather than
  in on themselves, eroding confidence in their character judgment or
  morphing into depression.
  
  Society must walk a similarly fine line. Veteran’s affairs Minister Alan
  Griffin has rightly referred the case to the Australian Federal police,
  and avoided buying into the claims being made by self-appointed
  guardians of military authenticity that public and ex-servicemen are
  regularly being ripped off by military “imposters” like Crane.
  
  We must not allow betrayal to undermine our trust in what Rodger calls
  “the world’s possibilities,” or increase our distrust or skepticism.
  Because the truth is that most people are worthy of our trust. They
  won’t let us down. And it is we who’d be the fools if we let men like
  Crane make us see the world any other way.

  Even if we eliminate people smugglers, the people needing smuggling
  won’t disappear.
  
  Kevin Rudd has an unnerving resemblance to Alfred E. Neuman, the
  gormless cover boy of *Mad* magazine. Periodically offered for higher
  office, Neuman’s election slogan is always the same. “You could do worse
  … and always have.”
  
  This week about 260 Sri Lankans, including 27 women and 31 children, are
  docked in western Java. They were seeking asylum in Australia, and are
  now refusing to leave their boat after being intercepted - at Rudd’s
  request - by the Indonesian navy. These people, and another 75 fleeing
  the brutal civil conflict in Sri Lanka who remain at sea in
  international waters, would have featured large in the Prime Minister’s
  discussion with his Indonesian counterpart in Jakarta last Tuesday.
  
  I’ve written about boat people and stand by my view that community
  anxiety about such asylum seekers (only 3 per cent of those who seek
  refuge in Australia) is a proxy for the frustration many Australians
  feel about the refusal of successive governments to develop a national
  population policy.
  
  But knowing why hysteria ensues each time a leaky vessel enters
  Australian territorial waters doesn’t tell us how we should respond to
  the men, women and children on board seeking our protection and whom
  history suggests will overwhelmingly be found to be genuine refugees.
  
  We all know what’s right. We know in the same way we know that if a
  young, scared-looking woman pounded on our door in the middle of the
  night seeking refuge from some unseen persecutor, that we must let her
  in. Refusing to open the door - or, having seen her approach through the
  blinds, unleashing the dog to drive her from the gate and into the arms
  of our none-too-savoury neighbour - doesn’t absolve us of a duty to
  help. It simply adds “weasel” to the charge sheet.
  
  Yet, in policy terms, this is what federal Labor is doing. This year,
  the Government has allocated $654 million to what it loftily describes
  as a “comprehensive, whole-of-government” approach to “combat[ing]
  people smugglers”. We need to stop kidding ourselves. Even if we
  eliminate people smugglers, the people needing smuggling won’t
  disappear. Just because people don’t suffer on our patch doesn’t mean
  they aren’t suffering.
  
  And anyone who thinks our Indonesian “friends” are not exploiting this
  Government’s determination to do whatever it takes to deny less than 300
  people on-shore processing of their asylum claims needs to consult the
  dictionary definition of realpolitik.
  
  The international convention on refugees was developed in response to
  the outflow of Jews from Europe after World War II and in light of the
  deaths of a third of the 937 men, women and children who embarked on
  what a later Hollywood movie would call the Voyage of the Damned. Having
  fled Nazi persecution in 1939, the SS St Louis was forced back to Europe
  after being denied entry to Canada, the US and Cuba.
  
  Australia signed the refugee convention in the 1950s but if we can’t
  honour our obligations, we should have the decency to formally withdraw.
  Better still, we could elect federal politicians with the will and
  capacity to lead, rather than grovel to the lowest common denominator.
  The Prime Minister still has the moral authority - not to mention the
  electoral margin - to open a new policy and rhetorical chapter on asylum
  seekers and population issues more generally.
  
  Should he fail to do so, Australia’s policies on refugees will remain
  just as Alfred E. Neuman said: “Like steer horns. A point here, a point
  there and a lot of bull in between.”

  A disturbing trend is emerging in the writings of those opposed to legal
  abortion. Since the passage of Victoria’s Law Reform Act last year, they
  have been campaigning against the limits the new law imposes on the
  rights of healthcare professionals to conscientiously object to
  involvement in abortion.
  
  From Liberal Senator Julian McGauran’s most recent contribution in
  Quadrant, to previous pieces by Father Frank Brennan (chair of the
  National Human Rights Consultation), Martin Laverty (CEO of Catholic
  Health Australia) and Doctor’s in Conscience’s Eamonn Mathieson,
  opponents of legal abortion argue that rights of medical professionals
  and Catholic health institutions to refuse care to women seeking
  abortions is absolute. Even where such denial could see a woman die,
  they maintain that refusing to provide an abortion is the right, and
  their right, to do.
  
  There is much that is offensive, even shocking, about the absolutist
  nature of such assertions. However important is religious freedom, it
  does not trump other rights. However important medical professionals
  are, their rights are no weightier than those held by others - certainly
  not their patients to whom they owe a duty of care. In fact, even if
  religious and conscience rights were trumping, there’s still arguments
  about whose religion or conscience - the doctor’s or the woman’s -
  should prevail when conflicts arise over abortion care.
  
  Where the rights of women seeking abortions are taken seriously (and
  these include their right to follow the dictates of their conscience, to
  informed decision making about their health, to timely medical care and
  to life), the absolutist approach seems inadequate at best. At worst, it
  seems to disregard the pregnant woman’s basic humanity.
  
  Perhaps this fact is why most of those arguing for a change to
  Victoria’s conscience clause rarely mention women by name. They don’t
  directly say, “we don’t care if women die, doctors conscience rights are
  supreme”.
  
  Rather they condemn the new law’s “coercion” of individual health
  workers and healthcare organisations to act contrary to their
  consciences by requiring “participation in abortion through … direct
  assistance.” They declaim with high dugeon the “extraordinary attempt by
  pro-abortion legislators” to threaten the livelihoods health
  practitioners who “are unwilling to … perform an abortion,” but never
  mention that the only compulsion to provide abortion in the Victorian
  legislation is in an emergency where it is necessary to preserve a
  woman’s life.
  
  The conscience clause in Victoria’s new abortion law requires just two
  things from doctor’s wanting to be excused from what the Victorian Law
  Reform Commission described as the “general expectation that
  practitioners will provide medical services”.
  
  The first is that they don’t exercise this freedom at the cost of a
  woman’s life. The second is that they ensure their refusal to provide
  timely medical care doesn’t translate into her inability to get timely
  medical care by providing an effective referral.
  
  For those willing to mention women by name, this seems the least they
  can do. After all, women have rights, too.

  *With no room at the Women’s, patients are at the mercy of religion*.
  
  There is no room at the Women’s. Once the hospital saw its mission as
  the service of all the Victorian women. Now, women inquiring about
  having their baby there will be asked their postcode. Should they fall
  outside the hospital’s new geographical catchment area and be at small
  risk of complication, they’ll be referred to a hospital closer to home.
  
  Poor government policy and planning, an upward blip in the fertility
  rate and Victoria’s burgeoning population has seen births jump 12 per
  cent in Victoria over a three year period, but the number of maternity
  beds fail to keep pace. As a consequence, the Victorian government now
  “encourages” women to birth at their local, suburban hospital.
  
  For most women, the major anxiety generated by the squeeze is finding
  somewhere, anywhere, to have their baby. But behind the scenes, some
  perinatal specialists and GPs who share the care of pregnant women with
  hospitals are fretting about women being referred away from
  non-sectarian public hospitals and towards institutions that are
  Catholic-run.
  
  The reason why is simple. Catholic-run hospitals, even those dedicated
  to women’s health, have a number of services they will not provide. As
  the Most Rev. Anthony Fisher explained earlier this year: “Catholic
  healthcare institutions, whatever legal, financial or other pressure
  they are under, may not cooperate with abortion, sterilization or
  euthanasia.” In addition, and for religious reasons too, Catholic-run
  healthcare institutions don’t offer a full range of contraceptive
  services.
  
  What are the downstream consequences of this refusal to “cooperate” for
  patients? Some women discover, as they approach a planned caesarian
  section, that they won’t be able to have their tubes tied at the time of
  delivery, requiring them to undertake the cost, inconvenience and risk
  of having the procedure done at a later date. Others, already reeling
  from the blow of abnormal results from pre- natal tests or screens the
  hospital did provide, find they must transfer to another institution if
  they make the difficult choice to terminate. Women whose membranes
  rupture too early may be denied surgery to remove the doomed fetus, and
  even intervention to speed up the delivery. That is, unless sepsis is
  diagnosed and the woman’s womb or life is at risk. Rape victims brought
  into casualty will not be offered emergency contraception. If staff
  suspect pregnancy, the woman will not eve be referred to a rape crisis
  centre that does offer the pills.
  
  Do Victorian women know the limits placed on their care when they enter
  a Catholic-run hospital? For many, it seems, the answer is, ‘no.’ As one
  GP put it, “I’m not sure women ever do fully understand the
  implications.” Currently, there seems no attempt for referring hospitals
  to consent women with regard to these issues, nor for Catholic-run
  hospitals to make specific disclosures on such matters when women arrive
  for care. For instance, neither the patient information guide, nor the
  guidelines for those sharing the care of pregnant patients with the
  Mercy makes any reference to the limits the hospital puts on services
  because of its religious views.
  
  Both Catholic-run health institutions, and the Governments that fund
  them to provide essential healthcare services to Victorian taxpayers,
  have an obligation to ensure that female patients, and the external
  healthcare providers sharing care of such patients, are fully informed
  about what the hospital’s religious philosophy might mean for patient
  care. For a hospital to simply say they are Catholic and assume that
  everyone knows what this means, including very young women, new migrants
  to Australia and those from non- English-speaking backgrounds, fails the
  most basic disclosure requirements necessary for informed consent.
  
  But lack of consent is just a small corner of the problem. The real
  issue is the decision by governments to pour public money into
  institutions unable to offer a full range of medical services to half of
  the public. The real problem is government policy that allows such
  institutions to become central to healthcare arrangements designed to
  serve all citizens despite knowing the limits such institutions place on
  the care they provide to women.
  
  Catholics, and any other faith-based minorities in Australia, are
  entitled to their moral beliefs and to the expression of these through
  the institutions they run. But women citizens and taxpayers have a right
  to healthcare provision that does not put them at the mercy of those
  views, and the healthcare information and options that flow from them.
  There seems little problem with Catholic hospitals providing
  boutique-care to women and men able to make an informed decision about
  its suitability to their needs. But when women have no choice but to
  become patients in this system for emergency and essential health care,
  something is terribly wrong.
  
  The Catholic Church sees the provision of health care as part of its
  mission, believing that a Catholic-run hospital “serves the whole
  community, especially the vulnerable.”
  
  Pregnant women are vulnerable. Rape victims are vulnerable. Patients
  without information and real options about their health care are
  vulnerable.
  
  Victorian women pay taxes, and are citizens with a right to informed
  decision-making about and access to the full range of sexual and
  reproductive health services. Not just those the Catholic-run hospital
  nearest them is willing to provide.

      Hi Leslie,
      
      Just wanted to thank you for your article in The Age - you articulated exactly what I've wanted to say for years! I'm sure you'll get dozens of messages about your piece; I hope the fanatical pro-lifers out there leave you alone.
      
      Reading your article, I recalled a personal experience in 2004 that left me more or less completely dysfunctional for the better part of 2 years, thanks in large part to the non-existent care I received at a Catholic hospital.
      
      I was studying at Melbourne Uni, out having a drink with friends in Carlton - my drink was spiked with rohypnol and I was sexually assaulted. I was quite badly bruised and bleeding and not found by my friends for an hour or so after the assault. My friends were not aware I had been raped, so an ambulance was called which took me to St Vincents Hospital (rather than The Women's which I'm sure they would have if they knew I had been raped). At St V's, I indicated I had been raped. I was given fluids, had some swabs taken and was sent home early the next morning. I went to the police the next day, who asked what I was drugged with...I told them the hospital hadn't taken a urine test, they told me to go back to St V's and be tested. I went back to triage, to be told that my record had already been sent off to storage so they couldn't tell me which doctor had seen me, or whether any tests were done. I begged them to do a urine test, which they finally agreed to, and said they would forward the results to a GP of my choice. I went back to the police station, they took my statement at the reception counter while a man waited to report his stolen pushbike, and a woman waited to have some I.D. certified. The police officer on duty told me he would try and get the surveillance material from the venue I was at, that he was going on 2 weeks leave but would contact me when he returned. I never heard from him again.
      
      I went home (at that stage, a residential college) and didn't get out of bed for 3 days, after that only get out of bed to eat and use the toilet. I missed 2 final exams - Melbourne Uni refused to grant me special consideration as I didn't apply for it within 2 days of the exam. I lodged an appeal, which was rejected. I eventually got the courage to call my GP for the test results, which confirmed that I was drugged with rohypnol. After 2 months of seeing noone, not showing up for the casual job I was due to start the day after the assault ad failing 2 subjects at Uni, I felt like a shell of a person...I broke out in an angry, itchy red rashe so went to a GP - a new one. He gave me some cream, asked if there was anything else - I started sobbing, telling him I had been raped. He got on the phone straight away to the Centre Against Sexual Assault and organised me an appointment for the following day, and gave me their 24 hour phone number. I went to the appointment, and was assigned to an incredible counsellor/advocate, Harriet, who informed me that there was a 6 month waiting list to access their counselling. My heart dropped, but I smiled, thanked her for her time and went home, considering suicide. Harried called me that evening and advised that she had arranged urgent counselling I was in urgent need and should have been referred upon my discharge from the hospital. She commented that the police and hospital staff 'must have skipped their weetbix that morning'. After intensive support and advocacy through CASA, things started to look up, although it took me over a year to return to study, work and any kind of a social life. I wonder how many mornings those police officers and hospital staff, and University administrators forget their weetbix?
      
      Now I don't think about the whole ordeal so much, until I read articles like yours that remind me that I wasn't offered any support, or emergency contraception, or testing for potential STDs, or DNA testing, or police investigation, or opportunity to re-sit my exams. It fills me with rage to think about how my rights and needs were so ignored. It makes me feel exploited, exposed and violated all over again. Luckily, I was on the pill and didn't contract any STDs. I eventually returned to study, but never graduated because I had so much negative feeling and resentment towards the prestigious institution I worked so hard to be accepted by. I never had the guts to follow up with the police. I lost so many friends, including one who told me I 'should be flattered [by the rape] because it means someone thought [I] looked hot'.
      
      I was failed by lots of people that year, but I often wonder how different my life might have been if the first person I disclosed the rape to (a male nurse at St V's) reassured me that what I had experienced wasn't my fault, and that they were on my side, and who referred me to someone who could advocate for me when I contacted the police, and asked my university for help. I don't know whether that was St V's policy, or whether I just had incredibly bad luck with the doctors and nurses that 'looked after' me that night...but I more or less lost 2 years of my life because of it.
      
      I'm aware that this is very personal and I apologise if its not welcome - perhaps I shouldn't have written but I feel its really important for people to know how these policies affect people in real life.
      
      I hope to read more of your articles in future - thank you for being thought provoking and empowering for women (well for me anyway),
      
      Kind regards,

      Dear Ministers,
      
      I am writing to each of the women in Cabinet because I am shocked that in 2009 there are still Victorian public hospitals in which women's choices over their own reproductive health come second to the views of the Catholic Church. I am booked to give birth in the Family Birthing Centre within the Mercy Hospital in Heidelberg in early February next year, and I am alarmed by the news (via Leslie Cannold's article in The Age today) that catholic hospitals such as the Mercy can and do determine which procedures they provide to women not based on public health policy, the wishes of their patients, or even resourcing, but on the religious views of the Catholic Church. While I don't really want to contemplate the thought, if something goes wrong with my pregnancy or my baby, it concerns me that I would be getting a more limited range of options (including options which could save my life or my ability to carry another child) at the Mercy than at one of our "secular" public hospitals.
      
      The Mercy is listed on the Health Department's website as a "Public Hospital":http://www.health.vic.gov.au/hospitals/pubwebs.htm. If the Mercy is funded as a public hospital - why should its policies be ANY different to any other public hospital? I feel that it is deeply unethical to allow a public hospital to be making life or death decisions around patient care based on considerations other than the patient's health and wellbeing, and overall public health resourcing considerations. People of any faith are entitled to their own views and to control their *own* healthcare, but if it is their job to provide public healthcare, then their own personal / religious / spiritual views (and those of any religious body they belong to) should be irrelevant. The only religious or spiritual views which are relevant are those of the patient.
      
      Cannold's article in the paper today was the first time I became aware that the Mercy's services are limited by the Catholic Church (despite being paid for by the Victorian taxpayers). My partner and I now have to decide whether we will continue with our plans to use the Mercy as our main maternity care provider or to start hunting at this late stage for somewhere else to give birth. I have also written to the Health Minister to confirm which Melbourne public hospitals provide a birthing centre AND do not put any religious limitations on their services. We will be living in the Preston area at the time of our estimated due date. I also strongly urge you to reconsider whether ANY hospital receiving public funding should put the religious views of its founding body ahead of the welfare and wishes of its patients. I am shocked that Victorian hospitals can do this at present, and I hope this does not remain the situation for long.
      
      With kind regards,

  In recent weeks, I seem to have become a bloke magnet. Two weeks ago at
  the State Library cafe and one night last week at my usual watering
  hole, I’ve had men in my ear. Sweet men, sad men, vulnerable men - some
  recently divorced, others single for years - crooning variations on the
  same tragic tale. A tale about children they love but no longer see.
  
  Once, I would have called them deadbeat dads. My own parents split when
  I was young but my father maintained scrupulous contact with my brother
  and me, and was dismissive of men who didn’t. And I knew the facts: that
  about 30 per cent of Aussie kids rarely or ever see the father who
  doesn’t live with them; and that before 1989, when the law gave men a
  choice about chipping in financially to support their children, only
  about one-third did. But as I listened to the stories of these grieving
  men, the moral issue was no longer clear. There is no shortage of
  grievances, legitimate and otherwise, when a couple splits. But when
  fathers want to share care of their children but
  
  are granted access only on weekends - leaving the Child Support Agency
  as the only institution affirming the role of men in their children’s
  lives post-divorce - something seems amiss.
  
  “I was more than a wallet to those children,” the man in the cafe told
  me. “I parented them.” Later, a diary he had kept of his daughter’s
  first words and subsequent language development would arrive in the
  mail: proof of his commitment and grief.
  
  The bloke at the bar, let’s call him Barry, was less certain of what he
  had to offer to his daughter who is three, no four, no three. He hadn’t
  seen her in years. “I don’t even have a place to live at the moment,” he
  confessed. “Had all my ID stolen a few months ago and been couch-surfing
  for the past three weeks.”
  
  I heard the rest of his sentence as if he’d spoken it aloud. “I wouldn’t
  be good for her, anyway.”
  
  “She told me to bugger off,” he continued, speaking of his former
  partner, a girl he’d got pregnant, then agreed to support. He sipped his
  beer primly before cracking a wooden smile. “So I did.”
  
  But here’s the real question. Does the fact that many men feel sad when
  made to feel surplus to requirements in their own children’s life -
  disenfranchised by the legal system or their former spouse - mean
  they’ve been wronged?
  
  Not necessarily. The terrible truth is that when relationships break
  down, what is in the best interests of children may not be what’s best
  for men.
  
  Research by Australian researcher Jennifer McIntosh finds that shared
  care is not the best arrangement for very young children and only works
  well for older kids where parents are emotionally mature and get along
  well. Men incapable of resolving the substance abuse, anger management
  or emotional issues that can contribute to relationship breakdown in the
  first place may not be the best influence on children, including their
  own.
  
  And according to the Australian Institute of Family Studies, there is
  “compelling evidence” that it is parental conflict and the negative
  economic consequences of divorce, not fatherlessness per se, that is
  costly for children of divorce.
  
  Deadbeat dads, or desperate, defeated and driven-away ones? You decide.

  A new friend of mine recently told me a story about an old friend of
  hers. I use the term “friend” advisedly here because friendship is what
  this story is all about.
  
  Ellen was asked by her school chum Cassandra to babysit her child so
  that Cassandra could nip off to a networking work function. She said she
  would be back no later than 4pm. In the event, Cassandra didn’t turn up
  until near midnight, having sent Ellen just one text message advising of
  her changed plans. Cassandra’s little boy missed Mummy, forcing Ellen to
  both manage and “cover up” for what she felt was a serious case of bad
  mothering.
  
  When Ellen asked for the favour to be returned in kind, Cassandra
  agreed, then welshed on the deal. Ellen arrived to find her little girl
  in the care of Cassandra’s hubby, when Ellen had specifically requested
  that the child be minded by Cassandra herself. “That’s it,” Ellen
  shouted at her old friend. “You and I are through!” And so things have
  stood, though now Ellen has doubts. Was she too hasty? Harsh? Or was she
  right to have taken a stand?
  
  Ending a long-standing friendship is hard to do. The reason why lies at
  the heart of what we understand friendship to be - a do-or-die,
  through-thick-and-thin pledge to another person. As our faith in the
  perpetual nature of romantic partnerships declines, a forever dedication
  to our mates has arisen to take its place.
  
  But if fidelity is part of the modern definition of friendship, then
  dumping a friend can be seen to reflect poorly not just on the
  Cassandras of the world but the Ellens, too. I understand how we got to
  a place where preserving old friendships feels like a moral duty. We got
  there because however much we exalt the choice and contingency that
  defines modern romantic relationships (we marry for love and, if
  dissatisfied with our choice, pull the plug and try again), it also
  makes us nervous.
  
  In the old days, everything was decided for us - work, who we would
  marry, the community in which we’d come of age, raise children and die.
  Gossip was rife, jobs were for life and divorce as rare as the social
  isolation that these days can be the consequence of constant job, house
  and partner upgrades.
  
  Inventing your life day after day offers significant upsides (doing what
  you want, where you want and with whom you want) but also downside risks
  (wrong choices can leave you unemployable, isolated and alone). Into the
  breach comes an increasingly non-contingent definition of friend. A
  person to whom one owes a secure loyalty, not one contingent on the
  failure of someone smarter, richer or funnier to come along.
  
  Despite this, there are circumstances where we are right to kiss an old
  friend goodbye. If a friend abuses your trust and takes advantage of
  you, they are not really a friend. Loyalty without limits sets the stage
  for abuse and becomes a destructive feature of a person’s moral psyche,
  not a virtuous one. Ellen needs to set limits on the friendship and
  explain these to Cassandra, as well as the consequences of their being
  overstepped. Cassandra’s response will speak volumes about the value she
  puts on the friendship.

  Parental leave - or maternity leave, as we tiresomely insist on thinking
  about it - is back in the news. Australia’s National Employment
  Standards now includes the right of workers to request 12 months of
  unpaid parental leave in addition to the year to which they are already
  entitled. A right to request flexible working arrangements to care for a
  child under school age is also part of the “Fair Work” mix.
  
  Fair? Work? In fact, the new provisions aren’t fair to anyone - not
  mothers, fathers or children - and they may reduce even further the
  tenuous attachment Australian mothers have to the workforce. The
  essential conundrum of parenthood can be summed up simply as this:
  working parents of young children want to be in two places at once. They
  want to be caring for their children, and they want (and in most cases
  need) to be in paid work.
  
  This is not, at its core, a gender problem. Young Australian women now
  participate in the workforce at the same rate as men and have similar
  aspirations with regard to earnings and careers. While mothers bear the
  brunt of pregnancy and childbirth, once the cord is cut, fathers,
  grandparents and other relatives - not to mention trained child-care
  workers - are all capable of providing quality care for children.
  
  In countries committed to equality between the sexes, the parenthood
  conundrum is articulated in gender-neutral ways. When Sweden’s generous
  parental leave provisions were taken up mostly by mothers, a portion was
  designated for dads on a use-it-or-lose-it basis. This bolstered women’s
  attachment to the workforce and freed men to take the time they said
  they wanted to care for their children, without losing points with the
  boss.
  
  Long stretches away from work are bad for employees and despised by
  employers. Jobs are restructured out of existence, and the lifetime
  earnings and superannuation savings of absent workers take a hit from
  which they never recover. It may not be discrimination, but women’s lack
  of hours and experience relative to men - largely due to “career
  interruptions” caused by motherhood - account for the 17 per cent less
  that Australian women earn on average compared with men.
  
  Men and children also miss out when women are the only ones to withdraw
  from paid employment to shoulder the parenting load. Australian men
  consistently cite work as a barrier to greater involvement with their
  children, while reports on generation Y men suggest they see sharing the
  housework and child care as a moral obligation. Australian children
  report missing their largely absent fathers, while research confirms
  that the presence of a loving and nurturing dad is as important for a
  child’s happiness, wellbeing, and social and academic success as having
  a loving and nurturing mother.
  
  The upshot of all this is that in the absence of carrots and sticks to
  encourage men to step up and women to step out, it will be Australian
  mothers who are most likely to take up the Government’s grant of an
  additional year of unpaid leave, and to wear the associated financial
  and work-related consequences.
  
  The same can be said about the right to request flexible work
  arrangements. Part-time and flexible hours are an essential but
  imperfect tool for solving the parenthood conundrum, yet some workplaces
  continue to expect full-time hours from workers on part-time pay, and
  the reduced visibility or productivity of the flexible workers often
  means they are overlooked for promotion.
  
  Again the problem is equality. If parents of both genders use flexible
  work conditions, then the associated costs will fall to both. But if
  only mothers are demanding such arrangements, then they become the group
  some employers would prefer to avoid hiring, or will choose to
  marginalise on the aptly named “mummy-track”, while fathers and
  childless workers get away scot-free.
  
  The Government’s new employment standards are not just blind to
  persistent inequalities of gender, but to social class as well. As Labor
  knows, bearing and raising children is expensive. Add to this the
  soaring cost of housing, and few Australians have the luxury of having
  one parent not working for years at a time. Any government serious about
  offering the bulk of Australian parents real opportunities to care for
  their children would ensure that parental leave was paid.
  
  Paid parental leave has been a political football for too long. Last
  month the National Civic Council took Tony Abbott to task for supporting
  maternity (not parental) leave, which it sees as part of a feminist
  conspiracy “to reward women who make feminist-approved lifestyle
  choices”. Conservative Christians are able to influence Labor as well -
  the party dropped its commitment to paid maternity leave from its
  platform before the last election, then flipped the issue to the
  neo-liberal Productivity Commission to rule on when it won the election.
  
  We need to set the squealing of minorities aside and put the financial,
  social and emotional needs of the majority of Australian mothers,
  fathers and children first.
  
  Australian mums and dads need, want and have a right to employment and
  to share the work of looking after their children. Work and care must be
  shared and parental leave must be paid. It really is as simple as that.

  A reader seeks advice in resolving one of the most distressing dilemmas
  ever tackled by this columnist. The mother of two daughters, aged one
  and three, habitually finds herself in the holidays in the company of a
  child abuser. This, at least, is what she has been told about the
  elderly father of her brother’s wife, who arrives each year at Christmas
  from interstate.
  
  Despite claiming he abused her sexually over many years as a child, the
  sister-in-law maintains a relationship with her father so she and her
  kids can have a relationship with her mother, their grandma. Despite
  this, our reader says the sister-in-law “will not ever leave her own
  children unattended with her father. As soon as my husband and I had
  children, she put us on notice about her father’s past behaviour. He has
  never been reported or prosecuted.”
  
  The situation has left the reader feeling “hijacked into being friendly
  to someone whose past actions I despise” and compromised in her capacity
  to ensure her daughters’ safety. What should she do? Put her foot down
  and refuse to attend further holiday events, forcing her kids to “miss
  out on wonderful times with their cousins and family” or grit her teeth
  and continue to watch her daughters like a hawk whenever the man is
  near?
  
  Both are morally unsatisfactory options. Why should innocent children be
  punished by missing out on family events because of the alleged crimes
  of others? Why should their mother have to sacrifice her integrity to
  cover up and compensate for a pedophile?
  
  She shouldn’t. Which is why, in the first instance at least, I’d advise
  against either and recommend a private chat with the sister-in-law. Not
  only might such a conversation provide reassurance about the substance
  of the accusations driving this dilemma, it might also allow our reader
  to ascertain whether continued silence about the abuse is really what
  the sister-in-law wants.
  
  Parents are larger than life to their children. Where abuse was present
  but never acknowledged or atoned for, the adult child may still feel
  guilt as well as fear of the abuser, despite an intellectual
  understanding that they weren’t at fault and that the abuser can’t hurt
  them any more.
  
  If this is the case for the sister-in-law, she may want someone to stand
  up and speak out. Despite being unable or unwilling to do so herself,
  she may yearn for someone else to confront the abuser with the enormity
  of his crime and demand he take responsibility for its rippling
  consequences.
  
  It is hard to predict the outcome of such a confrontation, which could
  be done by post after the man returns home or, failing a satisfactory
  response, in person when holiday time rolls around again. A best-case
  scenario might see the man apologise and offer to observe restrictions
  on his access to children or, perhaps more realistically, to claim
  offence and huffily refuse to be in attendance at next year’s events.
  
  Even if it goes badly - with the abuser ignoring letters or making
  heated denials in person - it’s hard to see how our reader could be
  worse off. Options of self-excluding or grinning-and-bearing would
  remain open, though they would be exercised in a more agitated social
  context.
  
  But at least her conscience would be clear. Because unlike now she will
  know she did all she could to protect her children, and to refuse to
  stay silent about a terrible wrong.

  The Bankwest press release was crafted to provoke controversy. “More
  Australians Choose a Good Time over Kids Education.” It had the same
  flavour as the bank’s offering when it released similar market research
  last year. “Aussie families prefer holidays and Botox to private school
  education.”
  
  Yes, the Bankwest “Social Indicator Series” is back, demonstrating once
  again that some Australian parents won’t forgo dining out, yoga classes,
  movies or holidays to pay fees for a non-government school.
  
  Not only are parents who don’t sacrifice to send their kids to private
  school vacuous and selfish, they’re stupid, too. As the press release
  makes clear, parent satisfaction with private schools is on the
  increase, while those who send their kids to public school are
  increasingly downcast.
  
  Bankwest’s spokesman, Adrian Bradley, explains the problem clearly.
  Parents just “aren’t prepared to budge on lifestyle [despite] the widely
  held perception that parents will sacrifice nearly anything in the
  interests of their kids”.
  
  Are those who sacrifice house renovations, family holidays, pools,
  dinner, yoga classes or movies to pay for private school good parents,
  while those who refuse to give up such “luxuries” bad?
  
  Bankwest thinks so, for its own self-interested reasons. Parents who
  refuse to sweat about their incapacity to pay close to $15,000 per year
  per darling to send their children to non-government schools are
  decidedly uninterested in the savings products the bank sells. An
  absence of parental anxiety about “planning ahead” to secure their
  children’s educational future is bad for business.
  
  But back in the real world, who the good and bad parents are is less
  clear. If I hadn’t done yoga when I had two children under two, I would
  have been a snarling, raving, stressed-out mess. I still remember my now
  13-year-old looking up at me as we marched off the beach on the last day
  of a long-ago family holiday. He was two. “Can we come here always?” he
  asked, and I knew what he meant.
  
  Can we come to this place where you and Daddy are always around and no
  one is rushing off to work or taking me to creche or cramming me into a
  trolley so we can do the supermarket shopping? Can we come to this place
  where everyone isn’t busy and we’re together all the time? Call it a
  luxury, but our yearly family holiday is the glue that holds my clan
  together. Sacrifice it to cover less than half the fees for one child to
  attend private school? Not on your nelly.
  
  A house with a pool is a drawcard for the sort of informal neighbourhood
  gatherings that build community. Experts advise parents to take time
  each week to have dinner or spend time together without the kids if they
  want to save their marriage. Renovating one’s house could mean the
  addition of a flat so the kids can spend more time with grandma, or an
  open-plan kitchen that allows parents to cook while yakking to the kids.
  
  There is nothing wrong with Australians arguing passionately and loudly
  about what makes a good parent. Parenting matters and, for many of us,
  raising our corner of the next generation is the most important job
  we’ll ever have. It is both right and human that we would look for rules
  and examples to follow, and strive to measure up.
  
  The problem is that while old ideals of good motherhood and fatherhood
  have been discredited, new standards have yet to evolve. Most mothers
  under 40 would likely reject the 1950s view that a good mother does not
  work outside the home, but disagree about the right mix of paid and
  home-based work a good mother should undertake. Modern men, too, are
  clear they want to be different to their own fathers, more involved and
  less consumed by the demands of earning, but are also unsure how to get
  the balance right.
  
  Uncertainty about what a good parent is makes us vulnerable to anxiety
  and guilt about getting it wrong. The Bankwest survey is an attempt to
  leverage those emotions to serve the bank’s bottom line. It follows a
  long and unfortunate Australian tradition of using the public/private
  school issue as a proxy for debate about who is and isn’t a good parent.
  
  A diverse community will have diverse values about what makes a good
  parent. Where liberty is prized, and people of different backgrounds
  live side-by-side, good parenting standards may not be ideals to which
  we all aspire, but minimum standards of “good enough” parenting below
  which no one ought fall.
  
  The capacity of parents to defer their own needs to meet their child’s
  is one such bottom line, though parents will disagree about which needs
  are most important.
  
  I sacrificed for my children, but only to give them what I thought
  really mattered. A calm and healthy mother, married parents and shared
  memories of happy times together were what I saw as essential to their
  future happiness and success.
  
  Saving, borrowing or spending up to half our income to pay for private
  school was never on the agenda.

  A reader seeks advice on an acutely female ethical dilemma. She has just
  landed a much-wanted interview for a nine-month job, but discovers
  herself pregnant. The child, if born, will be her third. If she
  miscarries, it will be for the third time, too.
  
  She wants the baby but, because of this history, is loath to reveal her
  situation to her prospective employer. She doesn’t even want friends or
  family to know, so why should an interview panel be privy to her private
  news? And if she cruels her chance of employment by telling, then
  miscarries again, she’ll be left with nothing - neither baby nor job.
  She’s done this before, withdrawn from a selection process for a
  once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, only to lose the pregnancy.
  
  Still she worries about misleading, or worse, being unfair. The law
  matters here. Law and ethics are different but practical moral advice
  must account for what the law forbids or requires. Although NSW law
  allows employers not to hire a woman if she is expecting at the time of
  interview, in most cases a refusal to employ a woman because she is
  pregnant violates federal anti-discrimination law.
  
  This means that if an employer uses a job seeker’s disclosure of
  pregnancy as a reason not to hire her, he is likely to be breaking the
  law: something job applicants are under no obligation to facilitate. If
  the employer heeds the law and disregards fertility status when making
  employment decisions, why should a woman be duty-bound to tell?
  
  But even if the woman is not legally obliged to disclose her pregnancy,
  is she morally bound to do so? I think not, for two reasons.
  
  First, because the implications of a positive pregnancy test in the
  months after conception are unclear. The one in five Australian
  miscarriage rate means that while the result could indicate impending
  motherhood, it may not. I ride my bike to work each day; a friend has
  high blood pressure. We all present some risk to our employers that we
  might fall off our perch. If they need human resources to do the work,
  it is a risk they must take.
  
  Second, because if women have a duty to report all would-be pregnancies
  to a would-be boss, the workplace discrimination and disadvantage they
  already suffer is likely to increase. Why should women be obliged to
  increase the challenges they already face - as a result of sexism, and
  structural barriers to work-family balance - in landing, keeping and
  making headway in a job?
  
  The truth is that most sexually active women aged 13 to 50 are at risk
  of being pregnant. If these facts of female fertility, as against the
  male sort, are seen as legitimate grounds for employer discrimination
  then equal opportunity for women will remain a pipe dream: an ideal to
  which we pay lip service but are unwilling to do the hard work to
  achieve.
  
  This is not to say that once hired and sure the pregnancy will stick, a
  pregnant woman ought not disclose to her employer, and do all she can to
  ensure that the requirements of the position are met when she leaves.
  
  It’s easy to mouth platitudes about equal opportunity. Easy to tell our
  daughters that they can achieve anything they want in this world. Easy
  to assert that a commitment to gender equity is what makes Western
  civilisations so different and great.
  
  A dilemma like this puts such sentiments to the test - one woman at a
  time.

  A READER - a qualified scientist I’ll call Ron - asks for my view on a
  dilemma that pitted his personal and professional integrity, and belief
  in absolute truths, against his love for a dying friend.
  
  Ron’s friend, also a scientist, was dying of cancer. “He said that he
  would never use magic bullets,” Ron says, “but after two years of great
  pain he turned to … a [medical] device I knew … was a blatant scam.”
  
  Should Ron have been honest and told his friend what he thought about
  his medical choices, or supported his friend in the choices he made,
  whatever Ron thought of them? Ron chose to keep his mouth shut. His
  friend died some months later. Now, he wonders, did he do the right
  thing?
  
  I think so. What really mattered in this situation was that Ron kept
  faith with the requirements of being a friend, not with his beliefs
  about the importance of medical interventions having a base in evidence.
  His friend was terminally ill and the Western medical kit bag was
  clearly empty so whatever he chose to do or not do was not likely to
  substantially alter the final result.
  
  People at the end stage of a terminal illness have two options. One is
  to put their affairs in order and live their life to the fullest, in
  full knowledge that death is imminent. The other is to fight, not
  necessarily in the belief they can win, but to assert control by
  resisting the unwanted end.
  
  In Helen Garner’s novel *The Spare Room*, the dying Nicola injects
  massive doses of vitamin C, then tosses off the pain and noxious side
  effects as evidence the intervention is “savaging the tumours and
  driving them out”. Nicola’s friend, Helen, rails at Nicola’s naivety.
  “Their treatments are bullshit, Nicola. They’re ripping you off. They
  can’t cure cancer.”
  
  But the truth is that what frightens and enrages Helen is not Nicola’s
  non-evidence-based approach to medicine. It’s her friend’s refusal to
  accept her own death. “You’re using that bloody clinic to distract
  yourself,” Helen tells Nicola.\
  “Don’t say it, Hel,” says Nicola. She raises one palm. “Don’t tell me.”
  But Helen won’t be stopped. “You’ve got to get ready.”
  
  It is easier for those of us who love and care for the terminally ill to
  witness their smooth transition through the Kubler-Ross stages of dying:
  denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. We sleep better
  knowing that as their time approached, our friend or family member was
  “ready” and “at peace”.
  
  The truth is that not everyone does dying the same way. Some will never
  come to acceptance. They will “go on fighting right to their last
  breath”, explains the nurse who comes to look after Nicola. “And it is
  one way of doing it.”
  
  For Helen, it was recognising that it was not the idiotic fruitlessness
  of Nicola’s vitamin C detox that was distressing and enraging her. It
  was Nicola’s inability to “work towards a glorious moment of
  enlightenment” and to admit she was dying and, by so doing, allow Helen
  and others who loved her to accept and be open about it, too.
  
  However painful we find it, supporting our friends to die as they see
  fit can be our final gift to them. Biting his tongue, as Ron did about
  the sham nature of his friend’s last-ditch medical efforts, didn’t
  compromise Ron’s integrity. It gave his friend permission to die
  fighting and was the act of a true friend.

  The politics are stupendous. Tony Abbott, a former employment minister
  who swore that paid maternity leave would become policy over the Howard
  government’s “dead body”, has a radical change of heart. Now Opposition
  Leader, he promises to introduce 26 weeks of paid parental leave in the
  first term of a Coalition government.
  
  “The difference between our scheme and Labor’s … is that mothers get
  real time and real money,” Abbott said. “I am determined to give women a
  better chance in the workforce, not to make it more difficult for them.”
  
  The announcement of the scheme, on International Women’s Day, left
  Labor’s delayed and paltry paid parental plan for dead, and the
  government casting about for lines. Witness Minister for the Status of
  Women Tanya Plibersek joining with the Business Council of Australia and
  the Australian Chamber of Commerce to lament the injustice of this
  “massive new tax on Australian businesses”.
  
  Experts and industry groups were also dismayed. Australian Industry
  Group chief executive Heather Ridout and Sex Discrimination Commissioner
  Elizabeth Broderick fretted that an extended leave scheme such as
  Abbott’s might discourage the employment of women.
  
  What is wrong with this picture? The same thing that has been wrong
  since the battle for paid leave began more than 40 years ago. We say
  paid parental leave, but we mean paid maternity leave. From the language
  to the symbolism to the fraught politics and poor policy that
  characterise this debate, work/life policy is crippled by the absence of
  men.
  
  While Abbott’s proposal is more generous than the government’s safety
  net plan of 18 weeks at minimum pay, both schemes are fatally flawed.
  Discussed, designed and sold in the language of “mums”, they flagrantly
  disregard the role men should - and many want to - play in the lives of
  their children. By failing to talk about childcare and paid leave as
  something of critical importance to children, men and women, both
  political parties doom us to more of the same work/life crunch. More
  oppressed women, more dissatisfied men, more children with exhausted
  mums and absent dads.
  
  Did you know that Australian men - 68 per cent in one poll - want more
  involvement in their children’s lives, but are impeded by work demands?
  Did you know that children whose fathers contribute meaningfully to
  their care have improved social skills, higher self-esteem and better
  results at school?
  
  Do you know that children tell researchers they want to spend more time
  with their fathers, and no amount of additional mother-time quells that
  ache? Did you know that women doing most of the second-shift of
  childcare and housework report feeling guilty and exhausted? Those who
  work part-time or stay at home reduce their lifetime earnings by at
  least $160,000 per child, end up on the “mummy track” when they return
  to work and wind up with 50 per cent less superannuation than men on
  similar wages.
  
  The most obvious solution to this problem continues to be overlooked -
  namely, that fathers and mothers share fairly the joys and burdens of
  paid employment and caring for their children - speaks volumes about the
  capacity of vested interests and entrenched social attitudes to stifle
  progress.
  
  That this is the case seems particularly clear given the ease with which
  a gender-equity paradigm could be given effect in policy. All we need to
  do is this: we need to say “parental leave” and mean it. We need to
  follow the lead of comparable OECD countries by allocating paid parental
  leave entitlements to families in a way that allows them to share it,
  and with a use-it-or-lose-it component for dads.
  
  Male leave must be actively encouraged in the short term because of our
  stubborn insistence on defining childcare and paid leave as “woman’s
  issues”. This has meant that despite many men wanting to care for their
  infants (50 per cent in one British study), they fear being ridiculed
  and punished as “unserious” if they do.
  
  Use-it-or-lose-it provisions allow men to care for their children
  without suffering workplace repercussions, while leaving those who don’t
  free to knock back their entitlement.
  
  At the start of the 21st century, the shift to a gender equity paradigm
  - and to serious, costed policy to match - is long overdue.
  
  It is time for a paid leave policy that includes fathers as equal
  participants, and promotes the best interests of children. It is time to
  put an end to all the waste, not just of female talent, but of the work
  of past generations of feminists who raised their sons to share the
  earning and the caring with their partners - until backward-looking
  policy and rhetoric made them think again.
  
  Repeat after me: the key to female liberation is men.

  *An independent study is needed of the pill’s impact on women’s lives.*
  
  IF YOU don’t know it yet, you will soon. This year in the US, Bayer
  Schering Pharma is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the oral
  contraceptive pill. Our turn comes next. The company launched the pill
  in Australia in 1961.
  
  As head of a women’s reproductive rights advocacy group, I got the news
  early, in a letter from Bayer’s business unit telling of their planned
  “national communication program” to inform the public of “this important
  milestone in women’s healthcare”.
  
  It invited me to “begin a dialogue of collaboration” that involved, as
  far as I could tell when I rang the number supplied, my group singing
  from the Bayer song sheet about the company’s “proud heritage” and
  current practice of “providing women with reliable and trusted
  contraceptive options”.
  
  Already the media blitz has begun, with reports of a study showing that
  women taking the pill have a lower risk of dying from any cause when
  compared with women who have never taken it. In fact, the research,
  partly funded by Schering - and with authors who list as competing
  interests the receipt of payments from Schering Plough and Wyeth
  Pharmaceutical - concludes only that “at least in … [a] relatively
  healthy … cohort, oral contraception is not significantly associated
  with a major public health problem”.
  
  A more critical non-profit-driven analysis of the pill’s impact on
  women’s health and lives reveals long-standing feminist scepticism about
  the first drug in history to be approved for long-term use by a healthy
  person. It was known before the first pill ever hit the market that
  estrogen increased the risk of cancer, but the first pill contained
  massive amounts of it - seven times as much as is used today.
  
  In 1969, investigative journalist Barbara Seaman blew the whistle with
  *The Doctor’s Case against the Pill*. The book prompted a US Senate
  investigation that saw the pill become the first prescription drug to be
  accompanied by package insert warnings. Seaman was blacklisted for her
  trouble.
  
  Magazines, under pressure from the pharmaceutical industry threatening
  to withdraw advertising dollars, refused to run her stories.
  
  The pill provides no protection against sexually transmitted infections,
  as some of those who came of age in the era of HIV/AIDS learned at their
  peril.
  
  Second and third-generation pills may put users at increased risk of
  deep vein thrombosis (especially if they are overweight), heart trouble
  (if they smoke), breast cancer (in the short term) and cervical cancer
  (in the longer term), although for some cancers, the drug seems
  protective.
  
  The pill is contraindicated for women with a history of migraines,
  jaundice or liver problems and safety scares are not a thing of the
  past. In the mid–1990s, women in some parts of Europe were told that
  “third generation” pills posed a greater risk of potentially fatal blood
  clots than their just-as-effective predecessors.
  
  The accumulation of such data led Public Citizen, a US consumer advocacy
  group, to petition the US Food and Drug Administration in 2007 to remove
  the pills from sale.
  
  Despite all this, Seaman said shortly before her death in 2008 that if
  her daughters had wanted to go on the pill, she might have cried, but if
  her granddaughters should choose to, she could “live with that”. Not
  that she believed no questions remained, including those about possible
  interactions between the pill and antidepressants, the most common drug
  prescribed to Australian women.
  
  Indeed, what becomes clear from looking at what data exists, is the
  corruptive effect of pharmaceutical money on the knowledge necessary to
  give women the information they need to make informed medical choices.
  Drug company-sponsored research tends to focus on potential new
  indications for old pharmaceuticals, or the relative benefits of a
  company’s new drug, compared with older offerings. Little research is
  available that compares drugs with non-pharmaceutical responses to
  women’s healthcare needs.
  
  The sexual revolution underwritten by the pill was, on balance, a boon
  for women, though it too came with downsides. The enthusiastic promotion
  of the pill by population control agencies, the medical establishment
  and the pharmaceutical industry - a tripartite cheer squad that
  continues to this day - led quickly to a view that all women were or
  should be “on it”.
  
  This has largely absented men from fiscal and social responsibility for
  contraception and the consequences of unplanned pregnancies (bye-bye
  shotgun marriages), despite the persistence of unlawful abortion
  
  and the stigma of single motherhood.
  
  Drug companies aren’t feminist organisations, nor deliberate drivers of
  radical social innovation designed to benefit women. They are
  businesses, seeking profits for shareholders through the creation and
  marketing of pills that, ideally, we can be persuaded to ingest every
  day for much of our lives.
  
  The anniversary of the contraceptive pill is indeed a time for
  reflection on the role of Big Pharma in our health and lives. Just
  remember what the aptly named band Public Enemy says: *Don’t Believe the
  Hype*.

  A mother writes to me, torn with guilt about a decision she made about
  the education of her daughter, who began kindergarten this year. The
  family doesn’t believe in “structured religion”, preferring instead to
  raise their children as “tolerant of all religions but followers of
  none”.
  
  For this reason, she refused her child’s participation in scripture
  instruction offered by the school.
  
  But the five-year-old was the only child in her year to be excused from
  the lesson and so was forced to sit alone outside the classroom while it
  proceeded. The little girl was so distressed that her mother - let’s
  call her Karen - reluctantly gave permission for her to attend Anglican
  scripture. But the decision doesn’t feel right and she’s still not sure
  that it is. What should she do?
  
  I’m not sure what part of this dilemma astounded or offended me more.
  That in 2010 supposedly secular schools are teaching religion or that
  parents who see such tutelage as inappropriate or inconsistent with
  their personal values or minority religion beliefs must choose between
  raising their kids as they see fit or being party to their symbolic
  casting out.
  
  At first I thought this story, however sad, must be one out of the box.
  A one-off predicament that bore no relationship to the parenting
  experience of the divinely challenged raising kids in NSW. But I was
  wrong. The basic elements of Karen’s story, and the ethical dilemma to
  which they give rise, is one facing about one in four families with
  school-age kids (the Education Department does not keep statistics on
  the exact number of kids who refuse religious education).
  
  Some of these parents tell their stories on a Facebook site dedicated to
  the issue, revealing heartbreaking tales of primary-age children forced
  to sit alone in a photocopying room while the rest of the class learned
  religion, or of being denied the right to undertake even the most
  innocuous time-killing activities - like knitting - when religious
  parents complained to the school that their kids were coming home with
  pleas to escape scripture so they could do the same.
  
  The origins of the problem date back to the 1800s, when the newly
  emergent state government brokered a deal with the churches. In exchange
  for loosening the stranglehold Christians had on education services, the
  provider - the state - would dedicate an hour for religious studies each
  week.
  
  Religious groups could choose a member of the clergy or any instructor
  they liked to teach children, well, anything they wished. Such as God
  made Adam and Eve and all the world. Or that Jesus put mud in someone’s
  eye and that man could see again.
  
  While the Education Act of 1990 gave parents the right to opt out for
  their children, it prohibited such students being offered timetabled
  lessons or scheduled school activities.
  
  So where does this Faustian pact leave parents like Karen? Between a
  rock and a hard place, which is why I have no problem with them making
  whatever short-term decision they feel necessary to protect their
  children’s psychological and emotional health. Children should never be
  sacrificed on the altar of their parents’ principles.
  
  But in the long-term Karen, and others like her, must fight. Beat on the
  door of the Education Minister until she amends the department’s policy
  that prescribes suitable alternatives being provided for kids whose
  parents say no to scripture. So that no parent, or child, has to endure
  what they’ve had to again.

  *When does an impolite boyfriend become unethical? Chronic rudeness on
  this or other fronts may indicate the presence of more serious moral
  disorders.*
  
  A reader named Pria asks whether the man she describes as her “boyfriend
  - so-called” is impolite or unethical.
  
  “So-called” arranges dates at the last minute, then breaks them even
  later, leaving Pria home alone on a Saturday night “watching old movies
  and tweezing my pubic line . . . to kill the time”.
  
  Her friends say she can and should do better but Pria wants more. She
  wants them to agree with her that the “inconsiderate, self-centred”
  bloke is more than just rude. He’s immoral.
  
  What, she wonders, do I think?
  
  Ethicists like to draw a firm distinction between ethics and etiquette
  but the truth is that the categories overlap.
  
  At their most trivial, manners are about preserving class distinctions
  through the enforcement of rigid, and at times nonsensical, codes of
  behaviour for when one is in the company of (relative) strangers.
  
  Proscriptions against putting your elbows on the table or touching the
  Queen unless she extends her hand first are good examples.
  
  But at the pointier end of etiquette, the distinction between manners
  and morals all but disappears. Prohibitions on interrupting may serve
  the more superficial goal of smoothing the rough edges of conversational
  engagements but also provide a way for individuals to indicate their
  moral respect for others through the other-centred act of listening.
  
  A person who constantly interrupts may show not just that he is
  ill-bred, but so self-absorbed that the only person’s ideas and feelings
  he deems worth hearing are his own. From the sound of it, Pria is right.
  “So-called” seems to be afflicted not just by a deficit of manners, but
  of morals, too. Yes, it is rude to cancel arrangements at short notice.
  Sometimes, however, it cannot be avoided.
  
  When the inconvenience caused by such breach of etiquette is accompanied
  by an apology, a sincere promise to avoid it happening again and
  reimbursement for all wasted depilation and hair-styling efforts (just
  joking, sort of) it can and should be forgiven.
  
  But chronic rudeness on this or other fronts may indicate the presence
  of more serious moral disorders. A man who continually backs out of
  arrangements with a woman is communicating a number of things.
  
  Among them is, “My time, and all the terribly important things I do with
  it, is more important than yours.” To say this to another, or imply it
  through your actions, is imperious and high-handed. Not just rude but
  morally arrogant.
  
  It could even be indicative, in extreme cases, of narcissism - extreme
  selfishness and excessive self-love resulting in an inability to sustain
  long-term relationships. If “so-called” is “just not that into” Pria -
  and it certainly sounds this way - he should have the decency to say so.
  It’s not a crime not to love someone - you either do or you don’t - but
  it is wrong to treat someone as if she were unloveable.
  
  If “so-called” can’t or won’t love Pria, he needs to do the right thing
  and let her go, so she can find someone who will.
  
  The fact that she has not demanded this, and may even have acted like a
  doormat in some ways when it came to “so-called’s” repeated antics, does
  not entirely excuse him from walking all over her. He needs to take a
  good hard look at himself and, for her own good, Pria does, too.

  TEASE: *How can human attributes be deemed corporate property?*
  
  TEASE: We tend to think of patents as good, or at least necessary, legal
  tools. Patents provide legal protection for innovations on which
  inventors rely to recoup the investment of time and money they made to
  develop a new medication, or bring a product to market.
  
  But where wrongly applied, patents can stifle innovation, drive up costs
  and restrict access to medicines and diagnostic tests. They can put
  lives at risk.
  
  Patents on genes do just that, yet the Australian government continues
  to grant them every year. To date, about 15,000 patents on human genes
  have been granted around the world, including genes linked to cystic
  fibrosis, hearing loss, hereditary haemochromatosis, long QT syndrome,
  Tay-Sachs and Alzheimer’s disease.
  
  Among the most high-profile victims of inappropriate patents are women
  at risk, or suffering from, hereditary breast or ovarian cancer. Myriad
  Genetics has patents on two of the genes that predict such cancers.
  Their proprietary control means scientists must seek Myriad’s permission
  to use the genes in studies designed to understand the cancers and to
  develop effective cures. Myriad has also used its monopolistic control
  to prevent women getting tested, to find out whether they carry the
  gene, in non-Myriad laboratories.
  
  In America, this meant that sick women could either pay the company’s
  exorbitantly high fee for the test or go without.
  
  In Australia, with our public health system, such extortionist tactics
  target the taxpayer. When Amgen had its 20-year patents on anaemia
  treatment erythropoietin (EPO) extended by the Australian patent office
  a few years back, $250 million was added to the public health bill. At
  least the treatment remains available.
  
  At the Westmead Children’s Hospital in Sydney, doctors are prohibited by
  a patent on the SCN1A gene from testing infants for epilepsy. This is
  despite the fact that those babies’ parents, and all other taxpayers,
  funded the research that identified the gene in the first place.
  
  Americans have had enough. In a landmark decision last month, a New York
  court ruled that patents for the genes associated with hereditary breast
  and ovarian cancer should never have been granted. The judge ruled that
  genes are products of nature, not innovations that can or should be made
  corporate property. Genes are part of all our bodies, the court noted,
  containing fundamental information about human life and health that
  should be available to everyone, not locked up by private companies for
  profit.
  
  While Myriad intends to challenge the ruling in a case that seems
  destined for the US Supreme Court, for the moment the Federal Court
  judgment is the law of the land. Until further notice, the US patent
  office will not grant any further patents on human genes isolated from
  the body, while those granted to date are now in jeopardy.
  
  Australians are not so lucky, or at least not yet. The Senate recently
  concluded a public consultation about the appropriate role of patents in
  regulating gene technology, but has yet to make recommendations. The
  inquiry looked at the impact of patents on the provision and costs of
  healthcare, the training of healthcare providers, the progress of
  medical research and the “health and wellbeing of the Australian
  people”.
  
  Its findings have been delayed due to the “complex nature of many issues
  associated with this inquiry” (and, it is rumoured, the well-funded and
  vociferous lobbying efforts of biotechnology companies).
  
  Australian legislators must also now be attentive to the US court
  decision, as US and Australian patent laws are kissing cousins. This
  means that while the American decision is not binding on Australian
  courts, it should have persuasive effect.
  
  Australian supporters of present legal arrangements say that without
  patents, medical innovation will stop. Why should companies invest in
  research from which they cannot profit?
  
  In a recent article in , Joseph Stiglitz and John Sulston - Nobel prize
  winners in economics and medicine, respectively - argue that for science
  to progress, and medical care to improve, the knowledge derived from
  genes must remain in the public domain, not locked up by patents. “As we
  move into an era where the sequencing of all of an individual’s genes is
  common and necessary for personalised medicine, free sharing of
  information about genes will be vital … to translate this information
  into medical advancements,” they wrote.
  
  Genes are part of our bodies. The understanding derived from them -
  knowledge critical to understanding and curing disease - is the
  birthright of all humanity, not the private property of a corporation.
  If we want knowledge about human nature and human health to flourish, we
  must ensure it is available to and for us all.

  Tony Abbott is said to be likeable. I believe it, though I’ve only met
  him once. Introduced by a *Crikey!* journalist in Parliament House
  Canberra, where I had gone to advocate against Abbott’s continued
  ministerial control over the fertility control drug RU486, the Health
  Minister refused to shake my hand.
  
  It was an honest move from an un-stage-managed man, and I didn’t have a
  problem with it. He didn’t like me and he let it show. It was as
  straight and simple as that.
  
  The Opposition leader’s recent attacks on the Prime Minister’s character
  are designed to highlight this virtue. By accusing Kevin Rudd of
  waffle-speak, standing for nothing and “gutless[ing] out,” Abbott
  invites us to brand him in contrasting terms: as a straight-talking
  leader with strong views and values, and a willingness to defend them.
  
  All fine and good, though it does beg the question-what does Abbott
  believe in? As Prime Minister, what policies would we expect him to
  design, and to fight to implement?
  
  Abbott’s background, employment history and associations offer some
  clues. Born in 1957, he was schooled at (Jesuit) St Ignatius College
  before studying for the Priesthood. He subsequently worked as a
  journalist and political press secretary before leading the successful
  campaign against an Australian republic. He is associated with groups
  that favour censorship but are opposed to legal abortion, dying with
  dignity, stem-cell research and gay rights. These include the National
  Civic Council, the Lyons Forum, the Endeavour Forum and the Australian
  Christian Lobby.
  
  Abbott recently described Aboriginal welcome to country ceremonies as a
  “genuflection to political correctness” and “out-of-place tokenism.”
  However, he believes Federal Parliament should continue to start the day
  with the Lord’s Prayer.
  
  Abbott believes the “argument [on climate change] is absolute crap”. So
  far, he has rejected all proven and economically orthodox means of
  pricing carbon.
  
  Abbott told *60 Minutes* in what he later described as a “spontaneous
  answer” that homosexuality makes him feel “a bit threatened.”
  
  Health Minister Abbott’s statements and policies on abortion renewed
  national debate about the issue. He described “the fact that 100,000
  [Australian] women choose to end their pregnancies” as a “national
  tragedy” that left a “legacy of unutterable shame.” He said there was “a
  bizarre double standard…where someone who kills a pregnant woman’s baby
  is guilty of murder but a woman who aborts an unborn baby is simply
  exercising choice.” The figure of 100,000 turned out to be wrong.
  
  Abbott voted against legislation allowing Australian scientists to do
  research using embryonic stem cells.
  
  Abbott wants to return to at fault-divorce, supporting legislation that
  would require spouses to prove offences like adultery, habitual
  drunkenness or cruelty before they can separate.
  
  At the launch of a collection of B.A. Santamaria’s letters, Abbott
  lauded his mentor for the view that “it [is] impossible to be a passive
  Christian.” Abbott argued that the Howard government’s decisions to
  “overturn the Northern Territory’s euthanasia law, ban gay marriage,
  stop the ACT heroin trial, provide additional financial support for
  one-income families, and try to reduce abortion numbers through
  pregnancy support counseling” showed that the “eight Catholics…in
  the…Cabinet” had turned the “tide of secular humanism.”
  
  Despite this, he recently implied on ABC’s *Q&A* that public and media
  interest in his Catholic beliefs was unfair.
  
  This is who Tony Abbott is and what he believes. It’s up to us to decide
  whether we want this sort of man, fighting for this sort of Australia,
  to be the next PM.

  parents, like most of their peers, were taken in by heroic media
  depictions of Jonas Salk, inventor of the polio vaccine, and the
  outpouring of scientific ingenuity in the cold war race to the moon.
  Like many of the children of this doctor-knows best generation, I was
  formula-fed, fully vaccinated and dosed with antibiotics at the first
  sign of sore throat.
  
  Only one of these health prescriptions-vaccination-is alive and well
  today, though recent claims by Jim Carey’s wife Jenny McCarthy on Oprah
  that vaccination caused her son’s autism have some parents running
  scared. At the same time, Australia’s efforts to halt climate change
  have ground to a halt. In the wake of errors in the report by
  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the ‘climategate’ email
  row-which saw British scientists accused of massaging climate data to
  disguise falling temperatures-public distrust of climate science is at
  an all time high. Such scares and scandals, writes Hannah Devlin in the
  Times Online, have “worrying implications… for the integrity of
  scientific research…and for the credibility of the scientific method”.
  
  The scientific method provides a way of knowing that, like democracy,
  may be the worst way of knowing things, except for all those other ways
  that have been tried. Scientists are people who know how to use the
  method, and understand that only those claims that survive it can be
  called “facts” or “true.” The rest is just conjecture. If we want the
  most reliable facts available about the world available, science is our
  method, and scientists the go-to boys and girls.
  
  But we don’t trust science-and revere scientific authorities-like we
  once did, who is to blame? The bone is usually pointed at the media,
  which does bear some responsibility for the problem. This is seen most
  clearly in the climate change debate, where the standing given to the
  contrary position of denialists gives them credibility that as mostly
  non-scientists, they haven’t earned.
  
  Climate change deniers are largely funded by conservative think-tanks
  that are, in turn, backed by some of the biggest and wealthiest
  carbon-emitting corporates on the planet. In one study, 78 per cent of
  books denying the reality of climate change or the need to act on it
  were linked to conservative think tanks. Few of these authors had a PhD,
  even from less-than-relevant scientific disciplines like biology.
  
  Despite this, the “balance” requirement sees climate change deniers
  regularly trotted out and given equal standing on the podium with
  scientists with relevant expertise, or allowed to fly solo in extended
  media interviews. When Lord Christopher Mockton, the 3rd Viscount
  Monckton of Brenchley, British business consultant, policy adviser,
  writer, columnist, puzzle inventor and climate change denier was in
  Australia recently, he appeared in the media 455 times. In contrast,
  when scientist James Hansen touched down at about the same time-Hansen
  heads NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies and is an adjunct
  professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at
  Columbia University-he gained only 61 media mentions.
  
  But the power of capitalist marketing and longstanding media modus
  operandi are not solely to blame. Scientific researchers, the businesses
  that commercialise and market their work and those who barrack
  uncritically for them from the sidelines, also bear some responsibility
  for declining levels of public trust in science. Vaccination is a
  classic case. Public health programs to support childhood immunisation
  rely on public trust that the jabs children are getting are both safe
  and effective. The health bureaucracy, medical doctors and
  community-based organizations vigorously promote vaccination as part of
  what they see as their broader remit to lionise evidence-based medicine
  over unproven cures.
  
  All well and good, except when real problems arise with vaccination, and
  such groups go to ground. Just last month, the Australian government was
  forced to suspend the national flu vaccination program for children
  under five after adverse reactions by hundreds of children around the
  nation, some requiring hospitalization. Media reports soon raised the
  possibility that a “too cosy” relationship between the vaccine
  manufacturer and the government may have corrupted decisions about its
  use, and that parents had been told to give it to their kids before
  adequate safety and efficacy testing and a proper risk/benefit analysis
  had been done.
  
  For example, Professor Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases expert
  from the Australian National University, told the ABC that before
  vaccines were approved and recommended for use by government, better
  studies and risk/benefit analyses were needed. “Before we roll out a
  vaccine to millions of people…we need to do studies of thousands of
  people over a period of time to make sure we are always going to do more
  good than harm with the vaccine…[Currently we don’t have] enough data to
  know how effective [the vaccine is] going to be.”
  
  In the wake of the problem, and issues arising at around the same time
  with a childhood pneumococcal vaccination, researchers at the Telethon
  Institute for Child Health have made urgent calls for a whole-of-life
  immunization register to help evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
  vaccination programs.
  
  Such claims would no doubt be shocking to many Australians, who may have
  assumed that those who tout the importance of evidence, actually
  practice what they preach. Australians who might have assumed that the
  medical interventions their government pays for and their doctors
  promote are supported by a rigorous and fulsome evidence-based:
  otherwise why would they support them? That these assumptions may be
  false can, and should be expected, to have a predictable effect-the
  undermining of trust in science.
  
  We will never go back to the days when science was the new religion, and
  men in white coats were expected to cure all the ills of the world. Nor
  should we. Reverence for authority should always be tempered, and no
  institution or profession mucking about in the real world can remain on
  a pedestal long. But by claiming the respect they deserve, and striving
  to ensure they deserve it, science may be able to get the public trust
  it needs to survive and prosper back.

  Corruption is the most serious moral scandal of our time. Why? Because
  corruption is a double-edged sword, a moral evil that may turn one
  chump’s decision to bribe, extort or otherwise abuse his power for
  personal gain into destruction of the very systems that order our
  society and make this country great.
  
  The abuse scandal in the Catholic Church is a classic case. The shocking
  thing is not the existence of priests who rape children. Thousands of
  years of historical records suggest that, sadly, there will always be
  men like this. The greater crime continues to be the church’s stubborn
  refusal to own the problem and to take whatever remedial action is
  necessary to comfort and compensate victims, to identify and punish
  offenders and get them away from kids. The problem is the cover-up. As
  the US newspaper *National Catholic Reporter* said recently about the
  continuing crisis: “This [is] not primarily a story of wayward priests
  but of an uncannily consistent pattern by individual bishops. In nearly
  every instance, bishops faced with accusations of child abuse denied
  them, even as they shuffled priests to new parishes, even as they
  covered up their own actions.”
  
  The latest allegations of branch-stacking in the Victorian ALP have a
  similar feel, right down to the flourish of hypocrisy that accompanies
  corruption in the very institutions you’d expect would revile it most. A
  former staffer for federal and state Labor ministers has given an
  insider’s account - replete with shadowy fund-raising events and
  non-fee-paying members recruited en masse - of how factional bosses
  determine who will gain preselection in safe Labor seats.
  
  The whistleblower’s motives may not be pure (he only came forward after
  payment for his branch-stacking was suspended) but that doesn’t matter.
  What matters is the party’s persistent refusal to undertake the systemic
  change its own experts said was necessary to fix the problem. As an
  editorial in *The Age* put it: “The cancerous effects on a party that
  breaks its own rules and marginalises members were spelt out in 2002 by
  Bob Hawke and Neville Wran but the branch stacking continued apace.
  Despite two damning independent reports last year on the Brimbank
  Council scandal in Victoria, the ALP’s own internal review found little
  of concern.”
  
  What should we do? First, admit that corruption is like mosquitoes near
  a swamp - inevitable. Human nature is flawed and, left untutored or
  unattended, some people will ride roughshod over the rules and customs
  that keep the rest of us in check. They will do so to enhance their own
  power, wealth or influence and with scant regard to how their actions
  affect others or the organisations they claim to serve.
  
  To stop them hurting others and destroying the fabric of civil society,
  we must build institutions that hope for the best but can weather the
  worst. Institutions armed with systems to minimise, detect and expose
  malfeasance by checking power and compelling transparency and
  accountability. Such systems must be regularly reviewed and updated, so
  just as the rogues learn them, the rules that govern play change.
  
  One final observation. Corruption is a culture. It thrives on
  insularity. I know someone who defends political corruption on grounds
  that the efficiencies are necessary and the ends justify the means. She
  seems to believe it, too, perhaps because I was the only person - or the
  first for some time - to reply to such claims with widened eyes.

  TEASE: At a press conference after his resignation, the former NSW
  Transport Minister David Campbell has this to say about revelations he
  had visited a gay bathhouse:
  
  TEASE: ’I made some personal choices which have put me and my family in
  this situation…I’ve apologised to them for it. I apologise to the
  community."
  
  Campbell’s apology was reminiscent of that made by golfer Tiger Woods in
  February. When Wood’s extra-marital affairs were exposed in the media,
  he held a press conference to beg forgiveness not just from his wife
  Elin, but from everyone else, too:
  
  “I was unfaithful, I had affairs and I cheated…I hurt my wife, my kids,
  my mother, my wife’s family, my friends, my foundation and kids all
  around the world who admired me…”
  
  Of course, Tiger comes from the land of the prostrate mea culpa. When
  South Carolina governor Mark Sanford held a news conference in June last
  year to reveal details about his extra-marital affair-the details of
  which had been known to his family for months-few were left off the list
  of wounded. Sanford begged forgiveness from his wife, his four boys and
  the state of South Carolina. “I have been unfaithful to my wife…I hurt
  you all. I hurt my wife. I hurt my boys.”
  
  It makes me want to hit someone. An extra-marital affair breaches the
  explicit promise most couples make when they wed to be sexually
  exclusive. Spouses who’ve been cheated on feel, and have every right to
  feel, betrayed and deceived, not just about the affair itself, but the
  lying that tends to go on to keep it under wraps.
  
  But what does infidelity in someone else’s marriage have to do with me?
  Why does a man I don’t even know, a man who never made any commitments
  to me one way or another about the post-marital whereabouts of his
  pecker, owe me an explanation, little less a mea culpa, when he sleeps
  around? In what way could I have understood his decision to play
  professional sport, or to represent me in parliament, as a solemn vow to
  me that he’d be faithful to her? Why would I even care?
  
  I do care, of course, but for all the wrong reasons. I care because
  other people’s dirty linen is compelling. I care because I am human and
  humans are pack animals, forever compelled to see how our own lives
  measure up against leading others. I care because I am occasionally
  smart enough to want to learn from the mistakes of others, rather than
  my own, and in matters of the heart the best way to do this is to stick
  my beak in where it doesn’t belong.
  
  But interested or not, it seems far-fetched-preposterous even-to suggest
  that who a famous person pokes is my concern. That all high-profile
  adulterers owe me the who, what, when and where of all non-missionary
  aspects of their sexual activity, not to mention a lavish apology
  whenever that behaviour fails to measure up to a set of rigid Christian
  standards to which I don’t even subscribe. In what way is my life
  altered by Campbell’s, Wood’s or Sanford’s adultery? On the basis of
  what promise-implicit or explicit-can I honestly claim that it has
  caused me embarrassment, disappointment or hurt?
  
  The stocks and pillory brigade say it’s not about the affair per se, but
  what it reveals about the public person’s character or judgment. But
  such assertions don’t hold up. Sure, marital infidelity may be
  indicative of poor character, but may also prove just the opposite. In a
  world with hues other than black and white, David Campbell’s decision to
  defer the pursuit of a relationship in which his emotional and sexual
  needs might be met in order to maintain his financial and other
  commitments to his sick wife and kids could be judged laudible, not
  reprehensible.
  
  And while playing around is an undoubtedly high stakes game in a world
  where the media knows no bounds or limits, the charge of recklessness
  may be an artifact of where the bar’s been set. The failure of some
  public figures to measure up to a standard that says they must
  demonstrate what conservative Christians would call exemplary behavior
  all the time may show they’re recklessness-a minor sin in any event-or
  prove only that such expectations are silly or unachievable for members
  of an imperfect race.
  
  Second wave feminists understood that the personal was political. Over
  the years this key insight has been bastardised in many ways. What was
  meant was that to achieve liberation, women must recognise how political
  and social circumstances shape their individual experience.
  
  The personal is political was never meant to suggest that every aspect
  of a public figure’s life is fair game.

  Craig Venter is back in the news. The entrepreneurial geneticist
  recently announced he has created a new form of synthetic life. The new
  microbe, which thrives and replicates with only a man-made genome, paves
  the way for a world full of organisms that are built to order rather
  than evolved.
  
  The technique, reported in the peer-reviewed journal *Science*, required
  20 scientists, ten years and $USD40 million to develop. ExxonMobil,
  however, has already placed an order with the J Craig Venter Institute
  for an algae that can convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into
  fuel, taking estimates of value into the trillions.
  
  So far, concerns about the development by ethicists and religionists
  have been predictable, and largely miss the point. Yes, there are risks
  the organism could jump the lab, but Venter has inserted what he says
  are fail-safe mechanisms into the microbe to render it harmless in the
  outside world. All scientific inquiry entails some risk. The question is
  whether those risks can be managed and are worth taking given the
  possible benefits.
  
  It is also true that Venter’s contribution allows humans to play God,
  but surely this is what humans have long sought to do. How else can we
  understand humankind’s attempts to predict earthquakes or vaccinate
  against diseases than a spirited attempt to control and influence the
  vagaries of the natural - or God given - world?
  
  The real problems posed by the Venter development are the stale legal
  and policy frameworks governing the world into which it’s been birthed.
  Venter makes much of the “societal good” he believes will come of what
  he describes as “one of the most powerful technologies and industrial
  drivers”. He says he is concerned that the applications of his work are
  used “for the benefit of all”.
  
  Maybe. But in a world where key features of modern day patent law date
  back to the 1600’s, and permit individuals or corporations to lock up
  scientific knowledge as a source of private profit, consideration of the
  public good remains optional.
  
  Ventor’s history suggests a keen interest in making knowledge critical
  to public health private intellectual property. His man-made microbe
  contains watermarks, five amino acid codes, that include quotations, an
  email address and the names of people involved in the £30million project
  (Dr Frankenstein not included).
  
  In the 1990s, his former company Celera Genomics raced against a
  publicly funded project to sequence the human genome. At the time, he
  had already applied to control the intellectual rights on more than 300
  genes.
  
  Luckily, he lost. In 2000 then-US President Clinton and British Prime
  Minister Tony Blair jointly announced that an international consortium
  working cooperatively and funded by public monies had produced a rough
  draft of the genome, which a White House press release said would “lead
  to new ways to prevent, diagnose, treat and cure disease”.
  
  But we may not be so lucky next time, and this is the point. New areas
  of science like genomics have long been outpacing the laws and policies
  that seek to govern them. Legislators and regulators urgently need to
  catch up.
  
  Our view is that where existing research and intellectual property
  frameworks are adequate to ensure that the building blocks of life -
  whether evolved or created-remain in public hands, well and good.
  
  But where such frameworks tilt towards handing any individual or
  corporation sole ownership of knowledge, knowledge that belongs to and
  can be used to benefit all of us, we have a problem. A problem most
  recently seen in the shut down of research critical to discovering the
  cures for diseases like autism, brain cancer and neurological disease by
  StemCells Inc on the grounds that the researcher was using a technique
  he had helped develop but they had patented.
  
  Patents over genes, the building blocks of life or what Venter calls
  ‘DNA computer code,’ are wrong. They are wrong in moral and in practical
  terms. They are wrong because they allow individuals or corporations to
  exclusively control information that belongs to all of us, and wrong
  because their patents discourage scientific progress or reserve its
  benefits to those who can pay.
  
  This view is shared by Nobel prize winners Joseph Stiglitz and John
  Sulston, who recently argued in *The Wall Street Journal* that gene
  patents, “not only prevent the use of knowledge in ways that would most
  benefit society, they may even impede scientific progress. Every
  scientific advance is built on those that came before it. There is still
  a great deal to learn about our genes, particularly how they contribute
  to disease. Gene patents inhibit access to the most basic information”.
  
  Venter’s synthetic life form only adds weight to the passionate claims
  from medical associations, geneticists, patients and academics have been
  making for years that the patenting of human genes is unproductive and
  unfair and must be stopped.
  
  Next month a long-awaited report from the Australian Senate into the
  impact of the granting of patents over human and microbial genes will be
  handed down. Australian lawmakers must not miss this critical
  opportunity to ensure that this country’s regulatory framework places
  the health and wellbeing of the Australian people and Australian
  environment above private profit.
  
  Scientific knowledge of evolved and created life must remain in public
  hands.

  Why can’t a woman be more like a man? Henry Higgins posed the question
  in *My Fair Lady* and ever since Viagra began earning Pfizer more than
  $US1 billion ($1.2 billion) per year, the big pharmaceutical companies
  have been asking it, too. Why can’t women’s sexual problems be cured as
  simply and profitably as men’s?
  
  Now, Boehringer Ingelheim says it can. It claims that a new drug for
  which it is seeking approval from the US Food and Drug Administration,
  Flibanserin, improves hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or low libido.
  The company says the condition affects one in 10 women.
  
  Flibanserin began life as an antidepressant but wasn’t much chop. But
  during its trials some women reported sexual benefits. Boehringer looked
  further. It now claims that 50 per cent of women with low desire who
  take the pill for at least six months say their condition improved.
  
  This outcome compares favourably with results reported for Europe, where
  trials failed to show any statistically significant benefit for women
  taking Flibanserin compared with a placebo.
  
  So does the drug work? Who knows? All we’ve got so far is Boehringer’s
  claims, which has only presented the contradictory findings of its
  studies - ones it has funded and conducted itself - in the highly
  abbreviated form of conference abstracts. No independent evaluations of
  either the drug’s safety or efficacy have been undertaken and no reports
  of the trials have appeared in journals. But the bigger problem with
  Flibanserin is that independent experts are unsure that the condition it
  claims to treat - hypoactive sexual desire disorder - actually exists.
  
  Men want sex often and intensely. Barring erectile problems, their
  desire leads to arousal and then to orgasm in a nice, linear fashion.
  Women’s sexual response - and I’m sure I’m not telling you anything here
  you don’t already know - is more complex.
  
  For women, arousal may be necessary for desire but not sufficient.
  Sometimes, women won’t want sex until they’ve started having it and many
  enjoy sex without orgasming. Being desired exclusively seems to be key
  to female libido, which may explain why relationships initially arouse
  women but cease to do so as time goes on. Indeed, while men tend to find
  their partners more desirable over time, women often need a new partner
  to rekindle desire.
  
  All this raises the obvious question about whether low libido in women
  is pathological or just evidence that female sexuality is different to
  men’s? Indeed, even if we accept that marital disharmony resulting from
  mismatched desires for sex is a problem in need of address, is a pill
  really the answer? And if it is, why medicate women? Why not give men a
  drug to settle them down?
  
  The reason seems to be that low libido, as well as other sexual
  deficiencies, could be big business. If women can be convinced that a
  pill will solve their problems by restoring what they have lost - the
  successful paradigm behind the marketing of the change as an estrogen
  deficiency syndrome for which HRT was required - there is serious money
  to be made.
  
  *Sex, Lies and Pharmaceuticals*, a book by Ray Moynihan and Barbara
  Mintzes due in September, says pharmaceutical companies have a lot to
  answer for.
  
  “The claim that one in 10 women have a chemical deficit in their brain
  that causes low desire is an absurd and shameful lie,” Moynihan told me.
  “The truth is that marketing is the foundation for these disorders. They
  use marketing to shore them up and make them appear more sold than they
  are.”

  A recent legal case in Melbourne, combined with the increased likelihood
  of an Abbott prime ministership, has resurrected fears about young
  people’s medical privacy.
  
  Seventeen-year-old “Shannon” sought support from a counsellor for issues
  arising from domestic violence and her mother and stepfather’s mental
  illness. Without Shannon’s consent or knowledge, the counsellor
  disclosed her confidences to family members and those living with her in
  supported accommodation.
  
  The privacy breach, discussed at length in a recent episode of ABC
  Radio’s The Law Report, brought Shannon’s already fragile life undone.
  She is no longer on speaking terms with any family members, and is
  terrified of confiding in any members of the helping professions whose
  support and comfort she arguably needs.
  
  In the words of the solicitor from the Youth Law Legal Service in
  Melbourne who obtained both an apology and compensation for the young
  girl, the professional’s breach of her privacy caused her
  “severe…trauma…and upset.”
  
  Health professionals and their professional bodies agree that privacy is
  a critical component of effective healthcare for adolescents. Even
  Francis Sullivan, the former CEO of Catholic Health Australia, an
  industry body not known for its emphasis on patient rights where these
  conflict with Catholic teachings, has noted that non-consensual
  disclosure of young people’s healthcare information risks exacerbating
  “…the very causes that led some teenagers to seek help outside the
  family.”
  
  At the heart of the near-universal support for adolescent health privacy
  is an extensive body of data. The research shows that the greatest
  barrier to young people seeking medical help is the fear their parents
  may find out.
  
  The converse is also true. “Young people are more willing to disclose
  sensitive personal information and return for follow-up care,” says
  Professor Susan Sawyer, director of the Centre for Adolescent Health at
  the Royal Children’s Hospital, “when services are known to be
  confidential.”
  
  In Australia, “mature minors” are authorised to make decisions about
  their medical treatment. A mature minor is a tween or teen with
  sufficient understanding and intelligence to understand the nature and
  consequences of the medical intervention proposed, and to give informed
  consent to it.
  
  While all those under 18 must be accessed on such criteria, it is
  generally assumed that those over 17 are mature minors, that those 14 to
  16 are reasonably likely to be, and that those under 14 may not have
  capacity to consent, particularly in relation to more serious
  treatments. The requirement for confidentiality is a corollary of the
  mature minor framework.
  
  Never one to let evidence muddy the waters of ideology, the now
  Opposition leader Tony Abbott was part of a government that in 2003
  lifted the age at which information about a child’s healthcare visits
  could be accessed by their parents from 12 to 14. As Health Minister he
  vigorously argued for this threshold to be lifted again, from 14 to 16.
  Had he succeeded, an entire group of Australians would have been denied
  independent and confidential medical care, despite most qualifying for
  it.
  
  Luckily, Abbott failed. But his vigorous pursuit of the change reveal
  much about the values and priorities of the man polls tell us is most
  likely to be Australia’s next Prime Minister.
  
  For Abbott, the right of parents to know what doctors their kids are
  visiting and when takes priority over the right of that “child” - the
  term he diligently applies to 14 and 15 year olds - to privacy.
  
  While conceding that some 14 and 15-year-olds might “wish to conceal
  from their parents” the medical procedures they have had or the
  prescription drugs they are on, he contends that “children should not be
  presumed to be the best judges of their own long-term interests and
  should not have the right to go behind their parents’ backs.”
  
  When parents and children are at odds, says Abbott, “the responsibility
  of government - and doctors - is to support parental authority.” This is
  because adolescents can’t act in their own best interests and so require
  adults to make their decisions, and “judgmental parents” should not be
  assumed to be capable of inflicting more harm on their children than
  “permissive doctors.”
  
  It is noteworthy that the “children” to whom Abbott refers are largely
  young women. Both logic and anecdotal evidence suggest that young men
  have less need of medical advice, and fewer privacy concerns. “Guys
  don’t have as much to worry about,” one 16 year old girl told *The
  Canberra Times*. “… they can’t get pregnant.”
  
  In a final and characteristically clueless fiscal flourish, Abbott notes
  that giving parents the power to purvey their (mostly daughters’)
  medical records was really not that much power at all. He scoffs at the
  claim that such privacy invasions might cash out in suicide or backyard
  abortion because “The worst that might happen is a teenager accessing a
  service but not claiming a rebate.”
  
  What is she going to pay medical bills or script costs worth hundreds of
  dollars with, Tony? Her parentally-controlled trust fund? Grandma’s
  backyard stash?
  
  The Liberals are doing their best to keep Autocratic Abbott under wraps,
  and to repair Abbott’s relations with women (he breakfasted not long ago
  with feminist blogger Mia Freedman). I suspect he’s also been out
  mending fences with others in the community who have memories better
  than goldfish about life under Abbott and Howard.
  
  I’m having none of it. Leopards don’t change their spots. Tony Abbott is
  still the Mad Monk or, as his daughter put it, “a lame… churchy loser.”
  If he comes to power, the Christian right will still have his ear and
  just as it was in the past, women, gays, single mothers, young people,
  Aborigines, religious minorities, migrants and those with the audacity
  to be disabled or unemployed will need to watch out.
  
  Labor needs to stop making elliptical references to the nightmare of an
  Abbott-led government and start spelling out exactly whose rights are
  likely to cancelled, and whose best interests will be decided by others.
  
  They need to explain not just what an Abbott-led Liberal government is
  likely to mean for “working families” and unionists, but the impact it
  would have on the rights, privacy and freedoms of all of us.

  *It’s easy taking candy from a baby. That doesn’t make it right.*
  
  This is James, a NSW scripture teacher: “The great opportunity we have
  in teaching scripture in our primary schools … is that we’re allowed to
  teach it up to an hour a week … I spoke to a … student … and I said:
  ‘Did you know that God loves you?’ and he said: ‘No I didn’t.’ Then I
  went through John 3:16 and asked him if he‘d ever heard that before and
  he said ’No.’ And it shocked me [that] … this boy didn’t even know that
  his creator loved him and cared about him … and sent him the Lord Jesus.
  The challenge is before us to capture the hearts and minds of children
  and youth, to talk about Jesus in the scripture classes …”
  
  This is Janet. She works for YouthWorks. Here’s how she advised her
  fellow scripture teachers to defend against the “threat” posed by ethics
  classes being available to primary kids whose parents opt them out of
  religious education:
  
  “In the younger years we need to sow the seeds strongly of the gospel
  and scripture. Get the Bible into people’s homes or parts of the Bible …
  Get scripture into people’s homes, so that by the time [kids] are in
  year 6 they’ve had a strong grounding in what the gospel is all about
  and they won’t be so easily falling for the ethics material.”
  
  This is Health Minister Nicola Roxon, who earlier this year rejected the
  findings of the government’s own preventive health taskforce to regulate
  the volume and types of advertising directed at young children.\
  “While the government is supportive of limiting the exposure of children
  to advertising that may unduly influence them, the government will not
  consider regulatory action at this time.”
  
  Adults are confused. Confused not so much as to the special
  vulnerability of young children to adult attempts to influence them (my
  reading of the above quotes suggest they understand this very well), but
  confused as to what this vulnerability demands of the grown-ups who are
  in a position to influence children, particularly if they hold positions
  of authority.
  
  If only influence-peddlers would self-regulate. If only they were the
  sort of people who, however much they stood to gain financially or
  however worthy they thought their message, would never take advantage of
  a child’s innocence to clinch a sale.
  
  Don’t hold your breath. YouthWorks’ advice to religious education
  teachers to hit six-year-olds hard to defend against later parental
  decisions to opt their kids out of religious education is risible.
  Australian industry is no better, with self-regulation having led to
  nothing more than a marked increase in food marketing to kids.\
  Parents are often lambasted for not shielding their offspring from such
  unfair influence but children’s ads come via the net, TV, Facebook,
  email and mobile phones. Without umbilical attachment, no parent can
  defend against this, which may be why 91 per cent of consumers in a 2008
  survey supported stronger government action.
  
  Children are easily misled. They lack the cognitive skills and abilities
  to “read” persuasive messages, whether these come at them in the
  classroom, or via a screen. From ages six to seven, kids think ads offer
  information, while those aged seven to eight can’t discern the
  difference between information and the intent of an ad to persuade. By
  ages 10 to 12, most kids are still unable to identify the sales
  techniques being used to get them to say, “yes”.
  
  That we know this and don’t stop the influence-peddlers taking candy
  from our babies should shame us all.

  *What does Australia’s first female PM mean for Australian women?
  Nothing. And Everything.*
  
  In the tense hours between 7pm on Wednesday until Labor’s caucus meeting
  on Thursday morning, women were emoting on Twitter: “My little boys may
  wake up to a female prime minister. I could burst into tears.”
  
  When Julia Gillard emerged as the nation’s new leader, we had this:
  “Daughters of Australia: ring your mum and say thank you for the
  possibility of Julia.”
  
  What does it really mean to have a female prime minister? What will
  change for Australian women, men and the country as a whole. Nothing.
  And everything.\
  Nothing because women in power are no different to men. As Julia Baird
  wrote in her book on the subject, Australia’s female politicians
  “backstab .., pursue … personal ambitions and openly criticise … each
  other” in the same manner as men.
  
  Despite this, the anointing of a female prime minister - by a female
  governor-general no less - does have the power to rock our world.
  
  The paltry representation, or absence, of women in roles that are
  visible, valued and influential has a cancerous effect on female
  self-esteem. Young girls can’t see it, so they don’t dream it. Women,
  who understand that there can only be two reasons for their invisibility
  - female inferiority of pervasive gender discrimination - feel angry or
  depressed.
  
  By proving wrong those who said there would not be a female prime
  minister in our lifetimes, the likes of Gillard kindle hope and incite
  rebellion. Less than an hour after Gillard was sworn in, female
  journalists began tweeting about the absence of women in senior
  editorial positions. Overheard in the newsroom: “Yes, but where are the
  female newspaper editors?”
  
  Gillard may also have particular interest, empathy and insight into
  gender-based discrimination. Certainly, she has experienced sexism. As a
  student at Unley High she protested demands that girls stay after class
  to tidy up while the boys had a good time. “Are you into women’s
  liberation, Julia?” the teacher asked, to which Gillard replied
  scornfully, “I don’t need women’s liberation, I was born free.”
  
  My favourite aspect of Gillard’s ascendancy is how she made her move.
  Characterisations of the process as one in which she had to be dragged
  to the podium, or tapped by faction leaders to consider a challenge, are
  mistaken. Gillard made her own assessment of the terminal nature of
  Rudd’s leadership and began summoning key MPs on Wednesday afternoon to
  gauge support.
  
  This may be Gillard’s greatest gift to Australian women: the forthright
  way she goes about her business as a powerful person in her own right.
  By doing this, she normalises women in power not as women but as people,
  with all the quirks and complexities of men. This makes her one of us
  and her path one we might stride, too.

  Important stories can hit-and develop-at the wrong time. Like in the
  days leading up to a coup that delivered Australia its first female
  Prime Minister. Such losses are an inevitable part of an unpredictable
  news cycle, but sometimes they must be resisted. Some stories are just
  too important to let fall off the radar.
  
  One such story concerns former Senior Detective Scott Gladman. Gladman
  was the officer charged with investigating rape allegations made by a 19
  year old woman against AFL footballer Stephen Milne six years ago. The
  case was eventually dropped. In a statement-released at the time and
  again when the story resurfaced-police said they had concluded on the
  basis of advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions and the results
  of “a thorough investigation” that there was insufficient evidence to
  prosecute the sportsman.
  
  Gladman tells a different tale, one backed up by his fellow
  investigating officer Mike Smith, another ex-cop. A tale of being
  hounded and pressured by fellow members of the force to “make it go
  away” and not “do the job as best you can.” A tale of being told the
  woman was “just one of those footy sluts” and of police being contacted
  directly by those with “vested interest in the possible outcome for the
  club.” A story of player interview tapes being stolen from desks and
  transcripts of interview found on a photocopier, and of the
  alleged-victim’s statement being leaked to the club, revealing her
  identity. And a tale of the senior officers to whom Gladman complained -
  those in charge of the sexual crimes squad and assistant commissioner of
  the region at the time-failing to respond to his concerns and do all
  that they could to make things right.
  
  Thankfully, the Office of Police Integrity are now investigating, with
  the Chief Commissioner promising to re-open the investigation if
  allegations that police deliberately sought to compromise it can be
  proved.
  
  The initial findings of such probes have been explosive, with raids on
  the criminal investigation unit uncovering the loss of crucial, and
  mostly irreplaceable, evidence including master tapes of initial
  interviews, reports from lead investigators and parts of the brief of
  evidence.
  
  Gladman makes plain that he thinks the case against Milne should have
  gone ahead, and a jury left to decide the player’s guilt or innocence.
  “There is a prima facie case still sitting there in that box at that
  office that should be answered by a jury,” he said. “Stephen Milne is an
  innocent person until he’s proven guilty in a court of law. However, we
  never got that far, because the…natural flow of justice was
  interrupted.”
  
  He said that telling the woman that, “the brief had been put to bed” was
  one of the worst experiences of his career. For colleague Mike Smith, it
  was a turning point. He says he lost “…a hell of a lot of faith.”
  
  It is this part of the story that moves me most. The startling
  revelation that in a modern Australian policeforce. there appears no
  place for these two good men. Indeed, it may be Gladman’s and Smith’s
  abundant integrity-demonstrated in their initial pursuit of justice
  without fear or favour, and their insistence on seeking it again-that
  makes them such a poor fit with contemporary police culture.
  
  A culture in which what some cops seem to think matters most is “to be
  seen to be more important in their eyes to the club … [by doing]
  anything they c[an] … to help.”

  Coverage of the federal election in the past week was briefly
  interrupted by the WikiLeaks saga.
  
  The international transparency and anti-corruption group roused a media
  storm when it released a compendium of 91,000 classified US reports on
  the Afghan war.
  
  Among the revelations are that elements in the Pakistani government have
  been collaborating with the Taliban and that officials have not been
  honest about the number and cause of civilian casualties.
  
  WikiLeaks, represented by its Australian editor-in-chief Julian Assange,
  enables citizens to anonymously leak documents that governments and
  businesses want to keep secret.
  
  In April, WikiLeaks footage of an American helicopter gunning down
  civilians in Baghdad made headlines around the world. The group also
  published the secret list of websites the Australian government plans to
  ban with its proposed internet filter.
  
  As the capacity of WikiLeaks to dictate and dominate the news cycle
  grows, it has also become the story. Much of the chatter is from
  journalists, who have traditionally seen it as a competitor and worried
  that its commando-style, volunteer-dependent approach might be the
  future of investigative reporting.
  
  Such fears were ameliorated by the handling of the Afghan war documents:
  WikiLeaks gave three news organisations early access to the documents,
  which released them alongside their own coverage and analysis. News
  chiefs saw this approach as an affirmation of the sifting, annotating
  and interpreting skills of the “professional journalist”. But amid the
  backslapping, key moral questions about the WikiLeaks phenomenon have
  been overlooked.
  
  The group believes transparency brings accountability and secrecy causes
  corruption. Societies in search of honest institutions and a properly
  functioning democracy require that powerful governments and corporations
  put everything on the public record for citizens to analyse and make up
  their minds. Where they fail in this responsibility, people of
  conscience must act with organisations such as WikiLeaks to get the
  truth out.
  
  There is much that is sound in this plan. It is true corruption relies
  on secrecy and secrecy veils and nurtures corruption. It is correct to
  say democracy is imperilled when institutions ritually rely on “national
  security” and “commercial in confidence” to withhold information
  required to ensure corporate or government integrity.
  
  WikiLeaks also issues challenges to the culture of secrecy itself. The
  ease and security WikiLeaks provides to leakers and the minimalist
  nature of the site’s editorial control encourages leaking. The more
  leaking there is, the greater the recognition among the powerful that no
  secret is safe. One sane response to this new reality is for
  institutions to abandon secrecy as their default mode and operate
  transparently instead.
  
  This is a citizen’s world, one ruled - with a light touch - by
  organisations such as WikiLeaks, but there will be problems. One obvious
  one is that occasionally there are legitimate reasons for secrecy and
  privacy.
  
  It’s no good to say that decisions about this data can be made
  collectively. Once information is known, it cannot be unknown.
  
  This leaves WikiLeaks to decide. With power comes responsibility and
  mistakes have been made. Founder Assange says the organisation will
  review its procedures and react, though the effect on the guiding
  philosophy of Wikileaks remains to be seen.
  
  Interesting times ahead.

  The gender divide in support for Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott is
  significant. Media analysis views it as women supporting a woman. This
  sidesteps the real concerns women have about Abbott’s views and past
  policies.
  
  Tony Abbott wants to take divorce laws back to the 1970s, with an idea
  that aggrieved spouses could be required to prove offences like
  adultery, habitual drunkenness or cruelty to be granted a divorce.
  
  Abbott blocked Australian women’s access to RU486 because he opposes
  legal abortion. He has said Christian politicians cannot check their
  faith into the parliamentary cloakroom.
  
  His musings on female virginity and premarital sex are also troubling.
  He needs to reassure Australian women that Parliament is not the place
  to impose religious rules or beliefs.
  
  Abbott’s views and past policies have and will continue to give rise to
  policies that undermine the respect and equality women have fought so
  hard to achieve.
  
  Women may be unsure how far Julia Gillard wants to move us forward, but
  we know that Abbott will take us back.
  
  We don’t care that Abbott has religious beliefs. But we have good reason
  to worry that should he become PM, he will impose his religious values
  on us.

  Around one in five young Australians suffers from mental illness. These
  include anxiety and depressive disorders, as well as complex conditions
  like anorexia and bulimia. Some 10 per cent of young Australians suffer
  abuse or neglect while one in five has a parent with poor mental health
  (21%) or a physical disability (19%).
  
  Young people with mental health issues are at increased risk of dropping
  out of school, becoming homeless, or ending up in the justice system.
  They are five times as likely to abuse drugs or alcohol (and from there
  wind up having unsafe sex, drink-driving or street brawling) and more
  likely to self-harm and suicide.
  
  Children’s mental health services are inadequately funded. Much like
  adult mental health services, this is not because we lack the money, but
  have chosen to spend it on something else.
  
  That something else is school chaplaincy. Last week the Gillard
  government pre-empted its own review and increased the program’s funding
  by more than a third. The total cost to the taxpayer now stands at $437
  million.
  
  You might think a government with $437 million would have an eye to the
  pain and suffering caused when youth mental health problems go
  untreated. You might think that government would be duty-bound to
  provide evidence-based solutions by addressing the woeful shortage of
  qualified counselors in schools (in NSW the one to every 1050 students
  is more than double the recommended ratio). After all, and quite
  literally, the lives of children are at stake.
  
  You might think so, but you’d be wrong. Instead, the Gillard government
  has deployed chaplains. School chaplains come from organizations like
  Scripture Union Australia which sees them as a means by which they can
  fulfil their organizational aim of, “mak[ing] God’s Good News known to
  children [and] young people” so “they may come to personal faith in our
  Lord Jesus Christ…and become both committed church members.”
  
  The Government knows chaplains are evangelical Christians, not mental
  health experts. This is why departmental guidelines prohibit chaplains
  from counseling students. They also ban chaplains from providing
  educational and medical services, as well as from proselytising. All of
  which begs the question: what exactly are we paying chaplains $20,000
  each to do?
  
  I’m not the only one wondering. As a report on the program reveals, many
  chaplains are unclear about their role. A majority admits they do deal
  with student mental health and depression issues, student alcohol and
  drug use, physical/emotional abuse and neglect, and suicide and
  self-harming behaviours. What most don’t do is refer to appropriate
  professionals when out of their depth.
  
  This is not an argument against religion in schools, though one can
  clearly be made. Rather it is an argument about wrong choices made for
  bad reasons that are putting our most vulnerable schoolchildren at risk.
  In a world of scarce resources, money spent on chaplains is money that
  could have brought-wait for it-around 5000 qualified counselors into our
  schools.
  
  Chaplains are also accidents waiting to happen, which may be why the
  Government can’t get far enough away from them when legal liability
  issues are mentioned. In various communications, it stresses that
  chaplains are not employees of the education department and suggests
  that the buck stops with school principals, Chaplaincy Service Providers
  or the school P&C.
  
  So what did our children to deserve our negligence? Nothing. It’s just
  that Labor needs to pick up an additional 1% of the religious vote in
  Queensland.
  
  Sorry kids.

  Here’s a question exercising some voters: What is worse? Casting one’s
  vote for a man who strongly believes in what’s awful, or for a woman who
  believes in nothing except getting herself elected?
  
  The conundrum exposes the two central items on our wishlist for
  political leaders: that they stand for something, and for something we
  like.
  
  Liberal Opposition Leader Tony Abbott’s strength is his believability.
  Having observed him for years as a high profile Howard government
  minister, we trust that he is as he appears: a conservative Catholic man
  guided in his political judgement by Vatican dictates on personal moral
  issues like abortion, stem-cell research and euthanasia, and by small
  government neo-liberal orthodoxy on much else.
  
  The consistent visibility of Abbott’s beliefs reassures us. It promises
  certainty with regard to the direction he would take the country. This
  is not just because such values direct some choices while prohibiting
  others but because, having held fast to these values for so long, we
  feel he won’t relinquish them easily. When challenged by economic hard
  times, boisterous community groups or international recalcitrance, we
  see Tony Abbott as someone who will fight for his beliefs, not cut and
  run.
  
  But Abbott’s strength is also his weakness. This is for the simple
  reason that his strongly held moral values are an anathema to most of
  us. For instance, reputable polls show that around 80 per cent of
  Australians support legal abortion, stem cell research and voluntary
  euthanasia. So, too, do we know that the economic agenda of the big
  business leaders who have his ear will leave most of us - and the public
  institutions and infrastructure on which we rely - worse off.
  
  The Prime Minister’s problem is different. As personable as Abbott -
  when in “real Julia” mode, anyway - she remains a lesser-known quantity.
  Where she has distinguished herself, or been noted by others, it is most
  often for matters of form, not substance. She seems smart and
  articulate, yet we have little sense of what direction she’ll steer the
  country because we don’t know the things that really matter to her -
  what she’ll fight for and never compromise on, no matter what.
  
  Gillard rarely discusses the things she believes in. Because of this, we
  tend to assume. We assume that because she has a working class
  background and made education the centrepiece of her parliamentary
  maiden speech that she favours a first class public education system.
  Having bravely asserted her lack of faith in God, we assume she will
  defend the barrier between church and state. Because she is Australia’s
  first female PM, we think she’ll stand and fight for the policies women
  need to succeed.
  
  But we are often proved wrong. In her short time in the top job Gillard
  has refused to alter the way government funds state and private schools
  and has expanded the school Christian chaplaincy program by a third. She
  opposes gay marriage and was the strongest opponent in Rudd’s kitchen
  cabinet of the miserly paid parental leave scheme Australian feminists
  battled for decades to achieve.
  
  To make matters more confusing, when Gillard moves against what we
  thought she’d defend, she tends to laud her stance as proof of her
  metal. The MySchools website is a textbook case, though what she expects
  us to draw from it is anyone’s guess. Does she view her willingness to
  screw an expected adversary - in this case, the education union - as
  proof of a practical even-handedness that she sees as the essence of her
  character? Or is this dispassionate judicial-like persona, concerned
  with formal process rather than substance, all she is willing to share
  with us, preferring to keep private the aspects of her character that
  would reveal her policy preferences and her heart.
  
  Whatever is the case, the real problem is that Labor’s tactics have
  undermined any claim to evidence-based policy at every turn. Whether
  it’s setting aside the Henry Tax Review to placate West Australian
  miners, or pre-empting its own assessment of the National School
  Chaplaincy Program to expand it by a third or proposing a citizens
  assembly to address the science of climate change, Labor has done little
  more than hand out taxpayer funds to marginal electorates or interest
  groups that scream the loudest throughout the campaign. And since week
  three, when Gillard shook of the shackles of Labor’s election
  strategists, she has been in charge and doing it her way.
  
  Having said this, Abbott also seems determined to undermine his own
  strengths on the character front. Avoiding press forums that might see
  him go off message, he looks at times to be visibly straining on his
  lead. While his pounding of the “no means no” mantra in response to
  Gillard’s request for a debate was widely lauded as a blunder, I suspect
  it did him good. It affirmed that, despite the muzzling, he remains the
  same man: oblivious to a feminist anti-rape slogan familiar to many
  12-year-olds, and one sincere in his illogical assertion that men with
  daughters can’t be sexist.
  
  There is something dispiriting about watching people we call leaders try
  to suppress their souls, or pretend they never had one in the first
  place. This is particularly the case when there seems no reason to have
  gone to such lengths. As respected social researcher Hugh Mackay has
  explained, campaigns have little impact on the election results. History
  shows that polls taken just before campaigns begin usually point to the
  result.
  
  This appears to be confirmed by the latest Neilson poll, which has Labor
  ahead 53 to 47 on a two party preferred basis, figures almost identical
  to the 52 to 48 split the same poll recorded a week before the election
  was called.

  Last week questions were raised about whether Quentin Bryce should
  excuse herself from the Governor-General’s role in the event of a hung
  parliament because of a conflict of interest. Bryce’s son-in-law, Bill
  Shorten, is a Labor MP likely to have a senior role in the Gillard
  government if it retains power.
  
  In response to the outcry, the Governor-General has sought legal advice
  on “concerns raised about her personal position in the current political
  circumstances”.
  
  Instances of conflict of interest are recurring ethical and legal issues
  in societies governed by the rule of law. This can be seen in ancient
  maxims that warn a man not to “serve two masters” or be a “judge in his
  own cause.”
  
  Conflicts are inevitable. Public officers have family, friends and
  colleagues to whom they owe loyalty. Sometimes their duties can
  conflict, like where their role positions them to make decisions that
  could materially benefit those to whom they are personally tied.
  
  Where this occurs, public officers must recognise it and act swiftly to
  address the problem. Failure to do so can undermine trust in the
  integrity of the decision, the office and the institutions of democratic
  society generally.
  
  What all this boils down to is a distinct set of propositions. First,
  that having a conflict of interest isn’t what makes you wrong, it’s the
  failure to address an actual or perceived one that’s the problem.
  Second, identification of a potential conflict does not and must not be
  understood to impugn the office-holder’s personal integrity.
  
  This second point, so misunderstood in the debate so far, is worth
  emphasising. No one concerned about conflict is saying Bryce lacks
  integrity. Rather, they want consideration of a more abstract question,
  which is this: is it in the best interest of Australia that someone in
  the Governor-General’s role, and with her family ties, excuse herself
  from making decisions about the formation of Australia’s next government
  in order to avoid bias or the perception of bias?
  
  The general, rather than personal, nature of this question explains why
  a person with conflicts cannot effectively redress them by swearing to
  act in an impartial way. Behaviour need not actually be biased for
  public trust to be damaged, a perception of bias is enough. This is why
  public officers are morally obliged to absent themselves from decision
  where there is a conflict or others could see it that way.
  
  Those who raised concerns at the Governor-General’s family ties were
  driven by concerns about good governance. They have been disheartened by
  the seizure of the issue by those with republican and partisan agendas.
  Such rough handling of a matter of principle also insults the public,
  which has made clear at this past election that they yearn to be treated
  like intelligent citizens capable of principled debate.
  
  The advice handed to the Governor-General on Friday suggested that while
  the legal situation was clear, the moral one was open. The
  Solicitor-General said that while Bryce was under no legal obligation to
  disqualify herself, her personal relationships “fall to be managed as a
  matter of prudence”. Prudence is a moral virtue meaning wisdom or good
  judgment.
  
  Whether it would be wise for Bryce to make critical calls about power,
  or whether it would be prudent to delegate this power to someone else,
  remains a judgment she must make.

  The first problem with no name was uncovered in the 1960s by a feminist
  named Betty Friedan. Once named, the problem had a chance of having its
  parameters defined and negative consequences addressed.
  
  Now, we are in the grip of another problem with no name. Yet the
  evidence is everywhere that worthy individuals are strangling in its
  grip and that in democratic societies the quality of public debate and
  political decision-making is staggering under its weight.
  
  The problem is a growing and collective regression in the way we decide
  what is right and true, and, on the basis of this knowledge, how to act.
  
  How did we decide in the past? Back in the day, people knew what was
  true because they felt it in their bones or because their customs and
  traditions spelt it out. Or they knew because powerful men in their
  community who claimed to represent their chosen god, or gods, told them
  or the local tribesmen commanded they understand it on pain of death.
  
  Arguably, the march of Western nations through the enlightenment and
  into the prosperity and social stability we enjoy today, has been the
  result of new ways of knowing. Since the 18th century, decision-making
  that involves persuasion by dispassionate rational argument and evidence
  has been the rage.
  
  But now, it seems, the titans of ignorance are struggling to reassert
  command. To watch them in action, tune in to *Fox News* or shock-jock
  radio or the comments section of any opinion website. What you’ll find
  there is more than evidence of the Dunning-Kruger effect or what
  Bertrand Russell referred to as the certainty of the stupid. You’ll also
  witness what John Birmingham calls the toxic, self-defeating culture of
  rednecks and the “calculating corporate succubus [that] both feeds on
  it, and exploits it for cheap labor and ready cannon fodder”.
  
  Part and parcel of this malignant culture is the deployment of threat,
  deception or slight of hand to silence dissent, or to manufacture
  consent. Here the greatest ridicule is reserved for those who dare to
  imply that their views are guided by reason, evidence and concern for
  the public good, rather than circular logic designed to pander to
  self-serving interests. Because, hey, it’s all just opinion anyway and
  everyone’s got one of those, so why give one person’s more weight?
  
  This is the true clash of civilisations. Or, to be more precise, the
  internecine collision of different ways of running a society that
  determines whether you get a civilisation or a nasty, brutish Hobbesian
  wasteland.
  
  In one corner are the critical thinkers who’ve spent years trying to
  wrap their heads around complex information and evidence so they can
  offer an informed view on public policy. They deploy reason and evidence
  in a good faith attempt to persuade their fellow citizens to choose one
  course over another.
  
  In the other are those who seek to get their way to serve the best
  interests of themselves, their family and their mates. They deploy the
  time-honoured tricks of the influence trade - charisma, threat, trickery
  and pork barrelling - while depicting the world as forever and
  intractably dog-eat-dog and anyone who doesn’t know it as a chump.
  
  Who will win the battle? It’s too early to say. But I fear for the
  experts - hampered by values of fair play that prohibit logical
  fallacies, question-begging and playing the person instead of the ball -
  even if it helps them win the day.
  
  Bloody sanctimonious elites.

  Senator Bob Brown has been trying for some time to repeal the Euthanasia
  Laws Act, a federal law that denies the Northern Territory and the ACT
  the right to legislate for assisted suicide. But the new-found power of
  the Greens and federal parliamentary arrangements arising from the hung
  parliament will soon deliver a vote.
  
  If the euthanasia act is repealed, the 1995 Northern Territory law it
  was designed to overrule will be back in operation. The ACT, which at
  the time of the federal kibosh was set to introduce dying-with-dignity
  legislation, may try again.
  
  Opponents of the right to die with dignity have been tut-tutting about
  the Greens’ commandeering of valuable time to debate the issue, which
  Opposition Leader Tony Abbott says is not “bread and butter”.\
  Those who are terminally ill, who fear they might be someday or love
  someone who is, see it differently.
  
  Indeed, I bet that most of the conscience issues likely to come before
  Parliament this term will be of far greater interest to the average
  Australian than most of the legislation that a typical majority
  government unilaterally decides merits attention.
  
  A 2007 Newspoll survey found 80 per cent of Australians supported
  doctor-assisted suicide for the terminally ill and suffering. Of those
  who did not, most (84 per cent) were religious. Despite this, opponents
  of reform have lately taken to insisting that religion has nothing to do
  with their stance.
  
  While this makes sense tactically, the results can be confusing. In a
  pluralist society, appeals to the faith-based views of religious groups
  to justify laws that govern us all must - and should - fail.
  
  But when faith-based commitments are the true source of a conclusion
  that dying with dignity is wrong and reason is used selectively in a
  post-hoc justification strategy, the result can be an intellectual dog’s
  breakfast.\
  The tools of secular ethical reasoning can’t be used in good faith if
  one’s faith commitments require a particular conclusion be reached. You
  must go where the argument takes you.
  
  Further confusion arises when politicians think the personal choice they
  would make if faced with a terminal illness must match the decision they
  make as legislators about dying-with-dignity laws.
  
  Laws that allow Australians to die with dignity won’t compel anyone to
  use them. This contrasts with the current situation, in which laws mean
  all terminally ill Australians must face their death in the manner one
  religious group thinks is right.
  
  MPs who truly believe in religious freedom and the rights of the
  individual should support legislation to allow everyone to choose how
  they’ll face their own death, even if the choice to die with dignity is
  not one they would make personally. Indeed, it is hypocritical for them
  to use a conscience vote to pass laws that deny a freedom of conscience
  to others.
  
  Opponents of dying with dignity will tell you that the core moral
  principle in a civilised society is respect for life. This is outdated
  tosh. The central moral value in a modern multicultural society is
  autonomy, the right of individuals to determine the course of their own
  lives and deaths according to their own needs and values.
  
  It is easy to tolerate others’ choices when we agree with them. The true
  test for “pro-life” politicians will be if they understand enough about
  what religious freedom really means to permit their fellow citizens to
  make a moral choice they think is wrong.

  It’s the end of the footy season, so everyone’s talking about rape. Or,
  more specifically, about the young women who were so stupid as to put
  themselves in a position where they’d be raped, or be able to claim
  later that they were.
  
  TV presenter Kerri-Anne Kennerley laid the blame on the “strays” who
  “throw . . . themselves at sportspeople”. “What do [women] expect,” she
  asked, “when they are out at night?”
  
  Former AFL player Spida Everitt was also scathing about, “Yet another .
  . . girl making alleged allegations after she awoke with . . . an
  alleged guilty conscience.”
  
  I have been raped. Twice. The first time was my first time - I was 17 -
  but I didn’t think of it as rape. Not even when the nightmares began
  and, following that, the depression.
  
  I just thought I was a stupid girl who put myself in harm’s way and got
  what I deserved. Embarrassed at being so dumb, I told no one what
  happened. It was only years later when I stubbed my toe and couldn’t
  stop crying that my mother strong-armed me into seeing a psychologist
  and the story came out.
  
  The second time was when an old boyfriend got my half-asleep roommate to
  let him into the house in the middle of the night. I was in my room and
  woke having sex. Surely this was a clear-cut case of rape but, again, I
  didn’t see it that way. Because now I was 21 and understood that you
  can’t thread a moving needle and I’d had sex with him before so what was
  the big deal and if I hadn’t wanted it why didn’t I scream?
  
  In fact, what I did - then and later - was pretend everything was fine.
  I acted like what happened was exactly what I chose to happen. I was not
  prepared to contemplate the alternative framing of events and its
  emotional corollary - that I’d been raped again and this meant that I
  wasn’t safe anywhere, not even in my own bed.
  
  I don’t want pity. Indeed, it’s fear of being seen as a victim that has
  led me to keep my personal story quiet thus far. I tell it now to try to
  inject the complex reality of sexual assault - how it happens and how
  those who experience it attempt to get their heads around it - into the
  public discussions we have most years at this time on the subject.
  
  I also want to point to the contribution gender stereotypes make to the
  problem. Like young women today, I was sold a double message. The
  explicit one was that I was strong, capable and free to do what I chose
  with my life and body - sexually and otherwise - and not be judged for
  it.
  
  The subterranean one was that if I acted as if I was entitled to be both
  free and safe, and someone did hurt or rape me, it was my own stupid,
  sluttish fault.
  
  These contradictory messages have co-existed quietly in my psyche just
  as they do for some young women today until the Kennerleys and Everitts
  of the world lay them bare.
  
  I laid my own demons to rest long ago. One thing that helped was the
  acknowledgment by one of the men that something bad had happened and it
  wasn’t my fault. This was several years later and we were at a party. He
  found me alone on the balcony and said this: “What happened . . . that
  night. I didn’t realise then but I do now. It wasn’t right. I shouldn’t
  have done it.” I forgave him right then and there.
  
  So where to now? Has increasing social and sexual freedom been good for
  young women, or bad? The truth is that this is the wrong question to
  ask. Equality and freedom are chances that some women will use poorly
  and others well. Certainly every young woman, like every young man, will
  make mistakes and get hurt. This is what coming of age is all about. The
  hope is that as time moves on, and a critical number of generations
  accumulate wisdom they can pass to their kids, the relative balance of
  those who use their freedom wisely will grow.
  
  For thousands of years, humans have lived in societies built on the
  exercise of superior male strength and the inevitability of female
  pregnancy. Inflexible and gender-inequitable rules for emotional and
  physical engagement between the sexes arose from these realities.
  
  As societies governed by the rule of law and populated by women with
  access to reliable contraception become the norm, new rules of
  engagement for relations between the sexes - ones based on mutual
  understanding, respect and consent - will flourish.
  
  There is no doubt that young men are changing. Many see women as their
  equals, are well across the concept of consent and - in response to the
  more assertive sexuality of their female peers - are interrogating the
  “real men always want it” stereotype as a first step towards a “no means
  no” mantra of their own.
  
  Similarly, we must recognise young women who report sexual assault as
  canaries in the coalmine. It is they who are blazing the trail towards
  the safe and equal world we want for our daughters and sons. This is
  because, unlike me at that age, they don’t have the words of Kennerley
  or Everitt in their head.
  
  Instead, they believe that, just like their male mates, they should be
  free to party with abandon when their team wins the grand final. And be
  safe while they do it.

  A report into what went wrong with this year’s seasonal flu vaccine for
  kids deserves our attention. The West Australian Health Department’s
  Ministerial Review into the Public Health Response into the Adverse
  Events to the Seasonal Influenza Vaccine sought to uncover the reason
  for “an alarming rise in adverse events following immunisation” that
  included vomiting, diarrhoea and febrile convulsions. Four weeks after
  the vaccination program began, Australia’s chief medical officer advised
  doctors across the country to stop giving the shot to children under
  five.
  
  We still do not know what caused the estimated 800 per cent increase in
  the number of febrile convulsions experienced by children who got the
  jab this year. But the review does shed light on other aspects of the
  health scare.
  
  First, it reveals an adverse event reporting system that is cumbersome
  and grossly unequal to its task of early detection of problems. There is
  no single agency responsible for monitoring and neither of those
  involved - including the Therapeutic Goods Administration - make it easy
  for parents and GPs to log adverse events. Existing methods of compiling
  and analysing various floaty bits of paper are slow and inefficient.
  
  Add to this the inability to ascertain the total number of injections
  given - the all important denominator figure essential to knowing
  whether the reported number of adverse events is higher than expected -
  and you have a system the report describes as neither “robust or
  timely”.
  
  It also fails to conform to World Health Organisation recommendations on
  mass immunisation programs. Each year Australia has only a short period
  to develop and test the seasonal influenza vaccine before it must be
  approved and manufactured. This means clinical trials are limited and
  that - to quote the WHO - “further testing of safety and effectiveness
  will need to take place after administration of the vaccine has begun”.
  
  To achieve this, countries must implement post-vaccine surveillance
  systems that monitor the product for safety and efficacy. However,
  Australia’s doesn’t. Not only are our usual monitoring systems plagued
  by structural deficiencies but we also failed to keep in place the
  monitoring the WHO recommended for the swine flu pandemic shots.
  
  This was particularly unfortunate, the review notes, given that the 2010
  immunisation was “significantly different” to previous seasonal flu
  vaccinations and the program involved very young children.
  
  Needless to say, parents knew none of this. They thought their
  government wouldn’t give vaccines to young children that had not been
  adequately tested. When their children were injured, some began
  researching the vaccine and discovered their faith was misplaced. The
  experience not only damaged trust in vaccination programs but the public
  health system more generally.
  
  So where to now? For a start, every one of the review’s recommendations
  should be implemented. If time constraints associated with getting flu
  immunisations to market mean safety and efficacy tests must continue
  after vaccine administration starts, it is imperative our post-vaccine
  surveillance systems provide rigorous, efficient, online and real-time
  monitoring of the number and type of adverse events in relation to the
  overall number of doses given. It is also vital for parents to be
  adequately informed about the testing and safety of flu immunisation.
  
  What happened this year was not good enough. Not at all.

  Are there big ideas in Australian politics any more? Or big politicians
  with big principles and the wit and courage to stand by - and for -
  them?
  
  The answer may be “no”. The forces decimating visionary and moral
  leadership include the hollow machine men running the main parties,
  their small target pre-election strategies of pacification and divide
  and rule, and the docile and dense political progeny to which corrupt
  internal processes give birth.
  
  The biggest loser in this political race to the bottom is public
  education.
  
  In the US, 90 per cent of the children attend public schools. In
  Australia, the figure is just 66 per cent and falling, as students
  follow the money flowing (with few or no strings attached) from
  taxpayers into the private system. The results have led to some private
  school students enjoying as much as a 62 per cent edge in resources
  compared with any of their public school peers. They also reveal
  Australia as having among the greatest gaps between high- and
  low-performing 15-year-olds - disparities the Organisation for Economic
  Co-operation and Development says are owed in large part to the
  student’s class, social and family background.
  
  Public education is all about redressing such inequalities of
  opportunity that arise from accidents of birth.
  
  Children are not born equal. Each is unique, and blessed - or cursed -
  with a particular family and community. Some will come into the world
  healthy and have two happy, employed and otherwise high-functioning
  parents. Others may start life struggling with poor health or disability
  and with parents encumbered by poverty, illness or addiction.
  
  What any child gets - genetically or family-wise - is the luck of the
  draw. Nearly all Australians would agree that the child should not be
  blamed or suffer the negative consequences of circumstances beyond his
  or her control.
  
  Public education starts with this agreement and then goes one visionary
  and extraordinary step further. In the spirit of individual endeavour on
  which liberal democratic countries such as Australia were founded, it
  proposes that not only should no child suffer the consequences of
  unchosen circumstances of birth, but each should be granted the same
  opportunity to flourish and generally get on in life.
  
  Such equal opportunity is not construed as a gift, but a birthright,
  founded in notions of fairness and equality between all people.
  
  Yet, despite the obvious equity issues, loud and proud defenders of
  state schooling are few and far between. You can’t slide a credit card
  between Labor and Liberal on the issue - both parties have created
  rapacious political constituencies for privileged educational services
  that must now be serviced by the taxpayer teat in the run-up to every
  election. There are even murmurs that the Greens are facing internal
  dissent on the party’s principled view that governments should
  prioritise the public education system and that equity must guide
  decisions about funding.
  
  Perhaps the impact of universal schooling on progressive generations of
  Australians has been so profound that we fail to recognise its
  contribution to the prosperous, democratic and largely harmonious
  society Australia is today.
  
  This may be true but it’s no excuse. Not for politicians and not for us,
  the voters, who must insist on answers from candidates for office about
  their plans to defend them.

  The religious rights of a small group of medical professionals do not
  trump those held by the remainder of the citizenry.
  
  I recently returned to Australia from Seville, where I attended an
  international conference on all aspects of abortion care. Among the
  issues discussed were the barriers women face to accessing termination
  services, even in countries where the procedure is legal.
  
  Foremost among these is refusal by medical practitioners and healthcare
  institutions on grounds of religion or conscience. They include
  religious doctors as well as public hospitals and clinics operated by
  Catholic groups and associations. Abortion is not the only service such
  individuals and institutions don’t offer. The list includes birth
  control (including emergency contraception for rape victims),
  sterilisations, infertility services and comprehensive HIV/Aids
  prevention information.
  
  Women suffer profound costs to their health and dignity when the medical
  professionals and institutions they are forced to rely on - and whose
  salaries and budgets they fund through their taxes - disregard the
  informed choices they make about their reproductive healthcare. In
  Poland, a woman effectively lost her sight when all three of the doctors
  who predicted this outcome refused to grant permission for her to abort.
  In Columbia, a 13-year-old rape victim was repeatedly refused an
  abortion despite her attempts at suicide when pregnancy and sexually
  transmitted infections were diagnosed. Countless women across the world
  have had religious doctors deny them accurate results from pre-natal
  scans to preclude them having the option of abortion.
  
  Despite the heartless and arrogant nature of such medical practice,
  Catholic medical staff and institutions staunchly defend it, and dismiss
  the suffering and loss of autonomy women endure as a result. In
  Australia, where the state of Victoria recently passed an abortion law
  that required refusing doctors to refer and to treat in a
  life-threatening emergency, Catholic leaders slammed the new law as the
  “nastiest human rights abuse”. A group calling itself Doctors in
  Conscience condemned the demand that religious doctors provide an
  abortion where their refusal would see a woman die as ushering in “a new
  era of healthcare in Australia in which individual health workers and
  healthcare organisations can be coerced to act contrary to their
  consciences”.
  
  In the same way religious doctors and institutions deny the rights and
  duties of medical colleagues whose conscience impels them to support a
  woman’s informed medical choice to abort a problem pregnancy. When a
  27-year-old mother of four staggered into a Catholic hospital in America
  last November, 11 weeks pregnant and gravely ill, the doctors told her
  that if she continued with the pregnancy her risk of mortality was
  “close to 100%”. But when Sister Margaret McBride authorised the
  abortion necessary to save the woman’s life, she was sacked and
  excommunicated. The priest heading up the hospital ethics committee
  justified this decision with the pronouncement that: “The reason for [an
  abortion] never matters.”
  
  Secular moral principles - those to which everyone in society can
  subscribe - do not support the unilateral denial by medical
  practitioners of particular types of care to certain sorts of patients.
  This is for the simple reason that no right, whether legal or moral, is
  absolute.
  
  The rights of a religious medical provider to refuse to terminate a
  pregnancy must be balanced against the similarly compelling rights of
  the patient to follow her conscience in choosing abortion. Medical
  practitioners also have an obligation to treat, a duty that in part
  flows from the monopoly they exercise over healthcare. Patients,
  relatedly, have a right to timely medical care as well as an entitlement
  not suffer direct or indirect sex discrimination.
  
  The religious rights of a small group of medical professionals do not
  “trump” those held by the remainder of the citizenry. A compromise
  between the two is required.
  
  A consensus on the necessary features of such a settlement is now
  emerging from statutes and case law in jurisdictions around the world.
  So far, what seems to be agreed is that institutions lack consciences.
  Only individuals have a right to refuse care on conscience grounds.
  Medical staff who are directly involved with the procedure are the only
  ones entitled to refuse co-operation on conscience grounds, and such
  refusals cannot encompass pre- or post-operative care. Emergency
  abortion care must be provided and, in non-urgent cases, medical
  professionals must disclose their conscientious objection to the patient
  as soon as possible and ensure an effective referral is made.
  Institutions and healthcare systems must guarantee the availability of
  full-service staff to meet patients’ demand and there must be
  consequences for an individual or institution where conscience claims
  result in women being denied the care to which they are entitled.
  
  The final feature of emerging conscience law also constitutes my final
  ethical point about conscientious action - that it cannot be invoked to
  violate the fundamental right of women to lawful healthcare.
  Conscientious exemptions to treat are grounded in concerns about dirty
  hands and the limited right of an individual, in a society committed to
  individual freedom, to avoid direct involvement with something her
  conscience or religion forbids. Deploying conscience claims as a means
  to deny women’s access to lawful services, however, lacks all moral
  legitimacy.
  
  This is not to say that morality precludes medical objectors from moving
  beyond the avoidance of doing wrong themselves to acting to stop what
  they believe is wrong all together. Rather it is to remind them that
  such behaviour is called civil disobedience - not conscientious
  objection - and requires far more sacrifice from them (including a
  willingness to go to prison) to be worthy of respect.

  Should progressive voters act to ensure the right side of politics is
  liberal, not conservative?
  
  In the wake of the chess-like analysis of the Victorian Liberals’
  decision to preference Labor before the Greens in next Saturday’s state
  election, Victorians voters must now confront their own tactical
  conundrum. In particular, the quandary facing those who take a
  progressive line on issues such as abortion, physician-assisted dying,
  stem cell research, artistic censorship and multiculturalism.
  
  Such voters face a hard choice. They can vote for Ted Baillieu, who is
  progressive on all these issues, or, by not doing so, risk confining him
  and his small-l brand of liberalism to history’s dustbin.
  
  Advertisement: Story continues below\
  Members of the Liberal Party share a radically individualistic, socially
  conservative economic agenda. But, just like Labor, they splinter on
  issues of individual rights, equality and the role religious beliefs
  should have in shaping the laws that govern us.
  
  The fall of federal Liberal leader Malcolm Turnbull to the sword of a
  man colleagues have dubbed Captain Catholic has arguably left Baillieu
  the last small-l Liberal leader across the nation. If he loses next
  weekend, it won’t just finish him as Leader of the Opposition but may
  also spell the end of small-l liberalism in Australia.
  
  Who cares? To quote a tweet from feminist cartoonist Judy Horacek, many
  of the progressive voters who share Baillieu’s stance on matters of
  individual freedom, equality, diversity and the secular state would “no
  more vote Liberal than fly”. Why should they care who leads the party,
  now or in the future, or whether liberal or conservative brands of
  Liberals are elected to Parliament?
  
  Well, they should care for the simple reason that the stance of the
  Liberals determines the tone, tenor and parameters of debate on
  progressive issues. Where numbers are tight or a conscience vote will
  determine the outcome, the number of small-l Liberal votes in the
  chamber will determine whether progressive policy falters or thrives.
  
  A progressive stance from the Liberals enhances the power of the
  progressive wing of the Labor Party while a conservative opposition
  emboldens its conservative religionists to frustrate change and advance
  their illiberal agenda.
  
  The abortion debate in the state in 2008 is a case in point. As former
  Victorian premier Joan Kirner has acknowledged, Baillieu played an
  important role in the success of the decriminalisation push. He made his
  intention to vote for reform early in the piece, and each time
  conservative religious Liberals sought to derail the process, he put
  them in their place. When Peter Costello tried to stir up community
  disquiet about the legislation, Baillieu did what is all to too rare in
  the male-dominated world of politics: he kept faith with his small-l
  Liberal principles even when it came to women. He told The Age that
  women deserved to be free to choose to have an abortion “without fear of
  unwarranted persecution, prosecution or stigma”, and added: “It’s time
  to provide some certainty, and for the women of Victoria this is a very
  important [time].”
  
  One has only to look at the inaction on law reform in Queensland and New
  South Wales - states lumbered with the same antiquated and unclear
  criminal provisions on abortion that reigned in Victoria - to recognise
  the key role of a small-l Liberal opposition.
  
  Even in Queensland, where last month a young woman and her boyfriend
  were charged and tried for the crime of abortion (a jury found them not
  guilty), there is no political will to repeal criminal provisions that
  hark back to 1861. The reason? In Queensland, the Liberals, in coalition
  with the Nationals, have a highly religious conservative bent and have
  joined forces with those of similar persuasion in Queensland Labor to
  stymie change.
  
  Baillieu is not progressive on every issue (although it’s easy for him
  to appear this way when his federal counterparts continue to move - to
  quote former prime minister Malcolm Fraser - “further and further to the
  right”). He is against gay marriage, a stance that undercuts his usual
  commitment to equity and diversity. But John Brumby opposes gay
  marriage, too. Unlike the Premier, Baillieu supports physician-assisted
  dying, an issue likely to occupy the attention of the new Victorian
  Parliament if the Greens have their way.
  
  So where does that leave Victorians who want to act in a principled
  fashion, but also tactically and with an eye to the future, when casting
  their vote?
  
  I think anyone who wants Victoria to remain the most sane and
  forward-looking state in the nation, anyone who wants the Liberal Party
  to remain a party of liberalism - not religious conservatism - has to
  look hard at Baillieu’s Liberals this time around because the stark
  truth is that unless a small-l Liberal opposition can win its way
  through to government - and soon - there won’t be any small-l Liberals
  left.

  It all comes down to Bentleigh, a Liberal strategist told me on Saturday
  night.
  
  He was close to swaying from exhaustion and the release of tightly
  coiled stress. Or near-release, as the outcome was not yet decided.
  
  It still isn’t. Counting will continue today, but so far the Libs are
  423 votes ahead.
  
  So what lessons can be drawn from the cliffhanger result, and a likely
  Lib/Nats victory? Early chatter from the commentariat has focused on the
  giant-slayer achievements of Baillieu and his team.
  
  Brumby’s strategy has come under the microscope, and some have trumpeted
  the end of the Greens in the wake of the party’s failure to make any
  gains in the lower house.
  
  Take a step back, however, and a different picture emerges, one that
  points to the importance of ethics in modern election campaigns and the
  governments that result.
  
  While Baillieu’s achievements in winning so many seats in one blow are
  indisputable, the result is a Parliament split right up the middle.
  
  Victorians seem to have chosen a chamber where the centre-left and
  centre-right parties are more or less equally represented.
  
  While it’s far too early to call results in the upper house, one
  scenario is that the Greens retain the balance of power, another that
  the Coalition will hold it by one. Again, this suggests that a moderate
  and consultative approach to policy and process by the party that forms
  government would be both fair and wise.
  
  Electors don’t like negative ads but campaign strategists insist they
  work. But the failure of a final week TV blitz - reviving Labor’s
  long-time criticism of Baillieu’s business interests - to impress
  swinging marginal seat voters has turned this political wisdom on its
  head.
  
  These voters may also have been impressed by Baillieu’s decision to
  eschew clever election tactics and simply refuse to preference the party
  of the left - the Greens - on principle. This suggests that the rise of
  “values voters”, usually discussed in relation to the Greens may be a
  broader phenomenon.
  
  This is not surprising. While electors in state polls may be mainly
  concerned with matters pragmatic and economic, they know that whatever a
  party’s policy and promises, they must be delivered by flesh-and-blood
  humans.
  
  This means that despite the well-known cynicism of Australians about all
  parliamentarians, voters must place some trust that they will do as they
  say.
  
  Of course, trustworthiness may just be one facet of a politician’s moral
  character that voters consider. Lightning can strike when voter
  judgments about moral character dovetail or conflict with other campaign
  messages and tactics. This may be what happened in Victoria.
  
  Labor’s negative campaign blitz reinforced voter perceptions that Brumby
  was more arrogant and less trustworthy than his opponent. My own
  suspicion is the previous relationship between the two men - they were
  in the same class at school - saw such tactics play particularly badly.
  
  In contrast, Baillieu’s decision, against conflicting internal advice,
  not to preference the Greens undercut the view of some electors that he
  was “weak” or “stood for nothing.”

  Last week, WikiLeaks began releasing documents from a trove of more than
  250,000 US diplomatic cables.
  
  The results have been stories in news outlets around the world. Some are
  in the public interest, some just of interest to the public or what The
  Guardian columnist Simon Jenkins calls “high-grade gossip”.
  
  Those that pass the public-interest test include revelations of tactical
  failures in the Afghan war that may have cost the lives of British
  soldiers and the Bush administration’s pressuring of Germany to not
  prosecute CIA officers who tortured a German national.
  
  Among the tittle-tattle is the view of a US embassy staffer that French
  President Nicolas Sarkozy is “thin-skinned” with an “authoritarian
  personal style”.
  
  News items still refer to WikiLeaks as a whistleblowing website but all
  references to whistleblowing - the act of informing on an individual’s
  or institution’s corrupt or illicit behaviour - seem to have been
  removed from the site.
  
  Instead we learn that the organisation’s goal is simply “to bring
  important news and information to the public” through leaks.
  
  We are told that “publishing improves transparency, and this
  transparency creates a better society for all people” and that WikiLeaks
  brings “truth to the world without fear or favour”. In cringeworthy text
  accompanying the embassy cables, the US government is reminded of the
  lesson of George Washington, the country’s first president, who “could
  not tell a lie”.
  
  Media and governments aren’t lying when they fail to fling into the
  public domain every document they write, any more than you and I are
  being dishonest when we fail to speak every thought aloud or decline to
  repeat the confidences of close friends to a football stadium of people.
  
  There is a legitimate role for editorial judgment and a need to protect
  individual privacy in media and corporate dealings, not to mention
  sometimes a requirement for secrecy in military operations, intelligence
  gathering and diplomatic negotiations. The arbiter for disclosure is the
  public interest.\
  It is vital that WikiLeaks not become about leaking for leaking’s sake.
  It must not abandon its fight against corruption in defence of the
  public interest to favour what the Federation of American Scientists
  calls “an assault on secrecy”.
  
  Instead, WikiLeaks must ensure it continues to grab headlines with the
  same stories that have won it awards from Amnesty and made its name.
  These include images of the Baghdad air strike and documents about
  extra- judicial killings and disappearances in Kenya.
  
  WikiLeaks is a game-changer, providing the raw data that can be used to
  shine light into the dark corners of corrupt corporate and civil
  institutions. It can be expected to change the way governments and
  businesses operate. In the future, openness may be the default and
  arguments made about why something should stay secret. This profound and
  important paradigm shift is largely down to WikiLeaks.
  
  This is why I hope the organisation will move to protect is own legacy,
  and the public support required for its continuing influence, by
  sticking to the task of whistleblowing, not just divulging secrets
  because they’re interesting or because it can.

  Last week journalist Michael Duffy wrote that there was “a great
  disconnect” between “what we know [Keli Lane] did - even putting aside
  the murder allegation - and the fact that by literally all public
  accounts she was a normal, happy and sociable northern beaches girl with
  a supportive and loving family, a passion for sport, and a healthy
  social life”.
  
  I disagree that the “great disconnect” is between Lane’s public persona
  and her sexual activity, repetitive pregnancies and the use of abortion
  and adoption as solutions.
  
  The disconnect is between the contradictory and punitive judgments
  Australians pass on women’s sexual and reproductive lives, and our
  denial of the corrosive impact these verdicts - and the restrictive laws
  that result - have on women’s self-esteem and their capacity to control
  their lives.
  
  The moral panic over Lane is familiar. We saw it in the Azaria
  Chamberlain, JonBenet Ramsey and Madeleine McCann cases. In each, the
  children’s mothers - Lindy, Patsy and Kate - were pilloried for crying
  too little or too much, for being manipulative or inscrutable. In each,
  media coverage painted the woman as deviant - a bad mother - and so
  culpable for her own tragedy. Such a strategy, says Booker prize-winning
  novelist Anne Enright, is a “potent form of magic” that calms anxieties
  that our own children are at risk.
  
  The coverage of Keli Lane also stereotypes her as a bad and unnatural
  woman - sexually rapacious, frivolously social, hyper-ambitious. This
  allows us to cast her out, beyond our collective compassion and any need
  to hear in her story something painfully revelatory about us, in
  particular about the conflicting messages Australian society is sending
  to its daughters - that they must be hot but not sluttish, sexually
  liberated but reproductively in control, maternally self-abnegating but
  highly accomplished.
  
  Lane appeared buffeted by such contradictions. She was terrified of
  losing the esteem of friends and family as a “golden girl” but worried -
  as she told a friend - that “the only thing [she might really be] good
  at [was] being a mum”.
  
  When pregnant, Lane seemed acutely aware of what Dr Susie Allanson, a
  psychologist who counsels women with problem pregnancies, calls the
  “huge stigma around women becoming pregnant when they haven’t planned
  to, embarking on single parenthood, having an abortion or choosing
  adoption”. Certainly, the judge had to remind the jury during the trial
  that there was no place for moral judgments about Lane’s choice to adopt
  or have terminations (she aborted two pregnancies and tried to end a
  third but was denied the service because of her gestation). In
  correspondence to the worker handling the adoption of her third child,
  Lane said: “Society says that this is wrong … that people who do this
  must be mad, slutty or cruel.”
  
  I want to be clear here. I am not saying that what appears to be Lane’s
  acute vulnerability to the contradictory demands on Australian women
  excuses murder.
  
  Instead, my point is to caution against stereotyping and dismissing Lane
  to avoid the unflattering truth, not just about the way Tegan’s death
  reflects on her but also on us.

  History is distressingly silent on the subject of the women in Jesus’
  life.
  
  Years ago, I was watching a documentary series on ABC TV called Son of
  God. The program set out to find the historical person that Christians
  now revere as Jesus Christ.
  
  At one point in a spell-binding narrative, we were told the names of all
  of Jesus’s brothers, and some details of what had become of them. But
  whether Jesus had sisters and how many, the narration continued
  breezily, was something we could not know because all the references to
  sisters in the gospels were unclear. The existence of such women and
  their names had not been documented.
  
  What kind of world painstakingly documents facts about a well-known
  figure’s male relatives, but allows the female ones to be lost to
  history? Recalling my lower jaw from the floor, I took myself off to the
  library to find out.
  
  The explanation I came up with was as illuminating as it was depressing.
  Two thousand years ago in the Middle East, a scribe would no more record
  the names of a famous man’s sister than a reporter today doing a profile
  on a farmer would write down the names of his sheep. Women simply
  weren’t considered people back then. They were, like a man’s flocks,
  just chattels.
  
  What would it have been like to be a girl at this time? Particularly a
  bright, inquisitive girl who admired her older brother and, just like
  him, thirsted to play a role in resolving the fierce conflicts - over
  beliefs, identity and territory - that were raging at the time?
  
  How might a man like Jesus - whose actual name was most likely Joshua -
  have replied to the predicament of such an intelligent and beloved
  sister? My intuition, and reading of the few sayings that scholars tend
  to agree Joshua actually uttered, is that he would have responded with
  compassion.
  
  To make this case, you have to know something about the world in which
  our hero - and perhaps our heroine - came of age. There, an individual’s
  standing and status among his fellows was entirely dependent on his
  relationship with God. Human suffering was seen as proof of sin and the
  Lord’s punitive hand. To win God’s forgiveness, one must atone through
  sacrifice at the Temple in Jerusalem.
  
  The cost of an animal sacrifice, on top of the price to simply enter the
  Temple, was beyond the means of many Israelites.
  
  The spoils of this spiritual monopoly flowed into the pockets of the
  hereditary Jewish elite who the Romans allowed to run the Temple any way
  they saw fit as long as they were acquiescent on other matters of state.
  
  Unable to afford redemption, the poor remained “unclean” - beyond the
  sight of God and man. The infirm suffered terribly, too, particularly
  when the sacrifices offered on their behalf by the Temple priests failed
  to bring about the desired cure for their leprosy or schizophrenia,
  proving them doubly cursed by God.
  
  Less well understood is that women, by virtue of their gender, were also
  quasi outcasts in ancient Israelite society. Their access to God - the
  key to their status in the world - was entirely dependent on their
  relationship with men. To be seen in God’s eyes, a woman had to be
  someone’s daughter, sister, mother or wife. This is why in the Bible,
  widows and divorcees crop up as victims of harsh social circumstances
  again and again, and mothers yearn so desperately for the social
  insurance of a son, who can still win them blessings when the other men
  they depend on are dead and gone.
  
  Joshua of Nazareth understood the plight of outcasts. “The first will be
  last and the last first,” he said. “Blessed are the destitute, the
  reviled, those who weep, who suffer and are hungry,” he insisted. While
  some say that such calls for recognition and respect for society’s
  reviled did not encompass women, this seems doubtful when he often
  explicitly included them.
  
  In the sayings and parables most scholars agree can be attributed to
  Joshua, we find justice-seeking widows, coin-sweeping housewives and
  prudent bakers who know just how to leaven bread so that one loaf
  becomes many.
  
  In the gospel of Thomas, Joshua responds to Peter’s scathing dismissal
  of disciple Mary Magdalene as “not worthy of life” by insisting that he
  will “guide her … for every female who makes herself male will enter
  heaven’s kingdom”. Added to this is evidence that women comprised many,
  if not most, of Joshua’s followers. Perhaps among these dignity-seeking
  Jewish women was one or more of Joshua’s sisters?
  
  The truth is that we’ll never know. When I realised so many years ago
  that Joshua’s sisters had been cruelly written out of history, and that
  no matter how much I cared, I could not reinstate them, I felt useless.
  None of the tools I had spent so many years acquiring as an academic
  scholar and general audience non-fiction writer were in any way equal to
  the task. I was surplus to what these women required.
  
  I tried to forget the sisters. To abandon them to the dust of the
  unmarked past where I’d found them, but failed. To do so made me feel
  complicit in perpetuating what they’d already suffered - the terrible
  pain of being forgotten.
  
  There was only one thing left to do. Slowly, I learned the craft of
  fiction writing so I could tell these stories the only way they could be
  told. By letting my imagination take wing.

  Informed women have the right to choose their delivery method.
  
  Mention Australia’s caesarean section rate and collective tongues start
  wagging. Our rate is too high, the experts say, partly because some
  mothers are too posh to push.
  
  It is true that Australia’s caesarean rate is high and, until recently,
  climbing. In 1997, 20 per cent of women gave birth by caesarean. By
  2007, the rate had climbed to 31 per cent, where it remains. This is at
  least double the 10 to 15 per cent proportion recommended by the World
  Health Organisation.
  
  But that ideal is 25 years out of date. Britain’s Parliamentary Office
  of Science and Technology says that if it repeated the exercise used to
  arrive at the initial figures, it would come up with a “rather higher
  range”. This is because the recommendation was derived from caesarean
  figures in countries that had the lowest mortality rates at the time
  and, today, few countries have caesarean rates below 15 per cent.
  
  Caesarean rates follow the money. In Brazil, caesarean rates in the
  private sector are 80 per cent. In Australia, women giving birth in
  private hospitals have a caesarean rate of 41 per cent, compared to 28
  per cent for those in the public system.
  
  Staff attitudes and institutional culture with regard to women’s choice
  also play a part. In one Australian study, 62 per cent of women having a
  caesarean in a private hospital said their healthcare provider had
  recommended it. This contrasted with the 40 per cent in the public
  sector.
  
  A comparison of two British hospitals by the Parliamentary Office of
  Science and Technology found that caesarean rates were lower in the
  institution where women lacked the “freedom” to “express a preference
  for caesarean section” and higher where women were “given information
  about the known relative risks of [caesarean] and vaginal birth”and
  allowed to make … the final choice".
  
  Such findings should sound alarm bells to anyone interested in the right
  of women to make free and self-directed choices about their medical
  care.
  
  The “too posh to push” claim is mostly myth. Anecdotal evidence from
  Britain suggests that some women request caesareans because they fear
  the pain of labour. We know from Australian and overseas data that most
  women want to have their baby the old-fashioned way. Guesstimates of
  those without medical indicators who choose caesarean are between 3 and
  15 per cent. This fits with the observation of the International
  Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) that most women will act
  to improve their chance of having a normal birth and healthy baby if
  they have access to the necessary information and support. In other
  words, most pregnant women will choose the option medical staff tell
  them is in their and their foetus’s best interest.
  
  But what if they don’t? There is no hard evidence on the relative risks
  and benefits of caesarean delivery for non-medical reasons compared with
  vaginal delivery. This makes emphatic assertions by health experts that
  vaginal birth is safer than elective caesarean for low-risk pregnant
  women worth less than a hill of beans.
  
  In the absence of definitive data, there are arguments both ways. One
  study found 31 per cent of female obstetricians would chose a caesarean
  over vaginal delivery because of risks of stress incontinence, anal
  sphincter damage and compromised sexual function following vaginal
  delivery.
  
  Even if medicos had the evidence on which to base an agreed
  recommendation about elective caesarean, women would still have the
  right to decide differently. The freedom to review and evaluate the
  risk/benefit profile of all available medical options and to make a
  decision based on one’s own needs and values is what informed choice is
  all about.
  
  The bottom line is that - short of engaging in self or child abuse -
  women do not have to prove to health professionals that their healthcare
  choices are good or worthy ones to have the right to decide. This is as
  true about their choice of delivery method as it is about how they look
  after themselves while pregnant, and how they mother once the baby is
  born.
  
  Pregnant women can choose a glass of wine with dinner, to have their
  baby by caesarean and to feed by bottle instead of breast. As long as
  they are making the decision freely, and on the basis of a substantial
  understanding of the issues, the choice belongs to them.

  Mixed-sex sleepovers? Help! Since reaching adolescence my boys have been
  keen to have girls who are “just friends” sleep at our house, and I have
  been just as keen to avoid it.
  
  Boys sleeping over have never been a problem. Over the years I have
  happily purchased bunk and trundle beds, as well as air mattresses, to
  facilitate it. But female friends? Sorry, I kept telling my sons. I’m
  just not comfortable.
  
  But no-because-I-say-so really doesn’t cut it as a reason for adolescent
  boys and fair enough, too. I’ve always prided myself as a person who has
  reasons for what I do. As a parent, when I don’t have a good reason for
  saying no, I try to say yes.
  
  Except when it came to girls sleeping over. Was I worried the girl’s
  family was in the dark? Maybe, so when my son last asked I agreed to
  speak to the parent. The exchange was comforting - the mother certainly
  knew where her daughter would be and was realistic about my minimal
  capacity for control - but my unease persisted.
  
  “You’re being unreasonable about this,” my partner said. “Do you really
  want to imply that boys can’t have friends who are girls?”
  
  He shrugged. “And if they’re going to have sex, isn’t it better it
  happens here instead of a park - away from prying eyes and close to
  condoms?”
  
  All good points but something still felt wrong, however inept I was at
  articulating what it was.
  
  “You’re acting like you’re worried your boy will take advantage,” a
  friend finally said.
  
  “No!” I said firmly. “That’s not it at all. My boys would NEVER touch a
  girl in a way they thought she did not want.”
  
  But here, perhaps, was a clue to my discomfort. What if the girl didn’t
  know what she wanted?
  
  There is a relatively straightforward relationship for boys between what
  they want, what they say they want and what they pursue - with sex, and
  everything else. Arguably, female socialisation is all about severing
  such links so women can make the needs and wants of others - friends,
  parents, needy children, ageing parents - their own.
  
  We certainly know that adolescence is when many girls lose their
  vitality, resilience and sense of self. Perhaps consequently, it is also
  a time they are at increased risk of depression and eating disorders.
  
  According to researchers Carol Gilligan and Lyn Mikel Brown, girls
  struggle throughout their teens to take their own experiences, feelings
  and thoughts seriously. Some can arrive at a place where it seems to
  them that they cannot say or feel what they feel and know. Battling to
  stay in a “genuine relationship” with themselves, they replace their
  authentic voice with a stream of “I don’t knows”.
  
  Suddenly, I had a way of explaining my angst. Sexual relationships are
  complicated at the best of times. Introduce youth and the stuttering of
  a partner who may be in the midst of a developmental struggle to
  identify and express what she wants and misunderstandings seem
  inevitable. I wanted nothing to do with it.
  
  I also didn’t want to add to the confusing mix of social messages girls
  get. What if saying yes to a sleepover felt subtly coercive to the girl,
  as though I thought adolescent sex was normal or even expected. Instead,
  I wanted to be like Switzerland when it came to adolescent sexual
  activity, wanting only for each young person what she or he
  authentically wanted for themselves.
  
  Good thinking or over-thinking? I’d welcome your view.

  The danger with retrospective legislation, which some seek to identify
  sperm donors, lies in its potential for injustice.
  
  Hard cases make bad law. This is as true of the common law and acts
  passed by Parliament as it is of the moral law. That is why whatever
  sympathies we have for donor-conceived adult Kimberley Springfield’s
  desire to contact her sperm donor, overhauling the legal framework
  governing assisted reproductive technology in the state and across the
  nation may not be justified.
  
  What is 26-year-old Springfield, whose case is before the Victorian
  Civil and Administrative Tribunal, seeking? She wants the Registry of
  Births, Deaths and Marriages - which manages the mandatory and voluntary
  registers containing information about Victorian donors, donor-conceived
  offspring and their relatives - to identify her donor by seeking
  information from the clinic where he gave sperm under conditions of
  anonymity.
  
  She then wants it to use that information to identify his whereabouts
  and to write to him advocating the purpose and benefit of the voluntary
  register.
  
  As Rachel Ellyard, representing the registrar, has made clear, this
  request goes well beyond what is authorised by Victorian law. “This
  isn’t about the rights and wrongs of why she would want to do that, but
  it’s a request that goes far beyond the ART [Assisted Reproductive
  Treatment] Act.”
  
  The problem for Springfield is that she was conceived before 1988. She
  has put information on the voluntary register and hoped her donor would
  do the same. But he hasn’t and she has no way of knowing why. Is it
  because he doesn’t want to, or doesn’t know the register exists?
  
  This situation differs from that faced by children conceived after 1988
  but before 1997, whose donors are informed when they use the voluntary
  register to request information about them (a request the donor can
  refuse).
  
  Children conceived after 1997 have a right to identifying information
  about their donor once they turn 18.
  
  It would be nice to equalise the entitlements of the pre~~1988 and
  pre~~1997 groups. But to do this, we would have to violate the legal
  assurances that they would remain anonymous that were given to men who
  donated before 1988.
  
  This promise should never have been given. Thank goodness we have
  changed the law to ensure only donors willing to be identified are
  recruited.
  
  The question is whether the needs of donor-conceived children such as
  Springfield are so compelling they justify enacting retrospective
  legislation.
  
  Retrospective legislation is a big no-no. The choices citizens make are
  based on rules in place at the time. To alter them and force people to
  live with the consequences of a decision they can’t change and to which
  they did not consent is unjust. Worse, it undermines the trust between
  citizens and governments essential for a functioning democracy.
  
  The unravelling of such trust can cause panic. Sperm donors, for
  instance, might start worrying they could be landed with financial
  responsibility for a donor-conceived child. After all, they might think,
  if they welshed on one promise, why not another?
  
  The potential for injustice, distrust and panic is why utterly
  compelling reasons for retrospective legislation are required. I remain
  unconvinced such reasons exist to alter the recently updated Assisted
  Reproductive Treatment Act 2008 again.
  
  Springfield says that without knowledge of her biological father and his
  genetic history she has no way of finding her “place of belonging in the
  world”.
  
  Sorry? Over most of our history, humans have embarked on the quest to
  discover who they are, where they fit and why they matter without sure
  knowledge of the genetic or social history of their male progenitor.
  This is for the simple reason that the identity of the biological father
  could not be definitively known. The suggestion that it is impossible
  for an individual to flourish or live a meaningful life without this
  information seems silly.
  
  Evidence also suggests it is a mistake to give too much weight to the
  contribution one parent’s genetics make to the health, identity and life
  chances of his biological child.
  
  It turns out that nature and nurture don’t just determine our
  opportunities but also expression of our genes, which the science of
  epigenetics has shown can be turned on and off by our social
  environment. The advent of new genetic tests that can scan our own DNA
  for hundreds of conditions is fast making knowledge of both parents’
  health history irrelevant to our own capacity to understand and care for
  our health.
  
  How many are like Springfield, born before 1988 and convinced they
  cannot flourish until they know their biological father? Research does
  not tell us. Ideally, however many there are, Victoria would have
  legislation that supports the particular requirements of all
  donor-conceived people to rest easily with their conception story.
  
  The choices we face are not ideal. I’d support a compromise that saw
  every Victorian household sent a letter about the voluntary donor
  register, so we had more confidence that those not on the register have
  refrained by choice.
  
  But further trashing the trust between citizens and governments by
  enacting retrospective legislation (we did this years ago with adoption)
  seems neither wise nor fair.

  This column is about lawlessness, and what your government is doing in
  your name. Or, more accurately, how it’s spending your money while
  dodging the oversight of Parliament in direct contravention of the law.
  
  It is about the High Court challenge to the National School Chaplaincy
  Program and the reason why - whatever you think of school chaplains,
  love or hate ’em - you should be hoping the challenge succeeds. Any
  Australian who cares about the primacy of the law over the electoral
  fortunes of the political party in power should.
  
  On the surface, Ron Williams v Commonwealth of Australia is about
  Williams, a father of six who wants his children to attend a secular
  school. By secular he means a school that is neutral when it comes to
  religion - a school that teaches kids about religions but doesn’t
  promote belief over non-belief or the belief system of one faith over
  another.
  
  So Williams sent his brood to the local state school, assuming it would
  fit the bill. It didn’t. Instead, his children were asked for gold coins
  to take for Scripture Union on crazy hair day or made to attend
  assemblies where the chaplain presided and a rap song was played
  extolling the virtues of chaplains over teachers as adults kids could
  trust.
  
  Williams’s desire is simple - to pull the plug on the program that,
  through “chaplaincy service providers” such as Scripture Union
  (“Christ’s ambassadors on the front line of ministry”) and Access
  Ministries (“transform[ing] this nation for God”), is feverishly trying
  to spend the $437 million of Commonwealth funds to put a chaplain in all
  the nation’s schools.
  
  But like all cases heard by the High Court, this one is primarily about
  legal principles of governance. Such as whether our government is
  allocating our money in a fair, honest and transparent way, and in
  accordance with the constitution.
  
  Williams says it isn’t. He asserts that the Howard, Rudd and Gillard
  governments have waved aside proper procedure to deliver wads of cash to
  a persistent and feared constituency. Legislate for school chaplains?
  Why risk parliamentary scrutiny and possible rejection? Instead, we’ll
  just slide the money into the yearly Appropriations Act under some
  innocuous item in the education budget.
  
  Absolute power’s nice when you can get it but we live in a society
  governed by laws. The kind of place where a little guy such as Williams
  - with the help of generous advocates and micro-donations from
  well-wishers - can have his day in court to say “no way”.
  
  No way should buckets of taxpayer money be doled out without Parliament
  having a say about the matter. No way should allocations be made in ways
  that violate the constitution - in particular, the bit that says the
  government can’t insist an Australian be a person of faith, or belong to
  a particular faith, to get a job. This is something that the
  government’s own guidelines and practices make clear is necessary for
  chaplains.
  
  The laws Williams is fighting to have enforced - government by and for
  the people, the religious neutrality of the state - go to the heart of
  what I love about this country. Let’s hope for all our sakes he wins.

  A few months back I was a guest on a morning talk show. “Dr Cannold,”
  one of the hosts asked, “Why is it that older women often don’t support
  younger ones?”
  
  I cleared my throat but was cut short. We were out of time. Later,
  however, my inbox and Twitter feed confirmed what I already knew. Women
  are desperately interested in the answer to this question and a related
  one, “Why do women join anti-women causes?”
  
  Here are my thoughts.
  
  Older women can be nasty to younger women because they’re jealous. Youth
  equates to fertility and sometimes to beauty. In a man’s world both
  confer power. Never mind that younger women may be unaware of this power
  or unwilling to use it (often and ironically because they have listened
  when their female elders advised against it). The bald facts are that
  younger women have power that the uncompromising gavel of time has
  pronounced inaccessible to older women. In a world that limits women’s
  access to other routes of influence over their own destiny, this loss
  hurts.
  
  Older women can be less willing mentors than older men. Take a look
  around and the reasons for this become clear. To give those scrambling
  up behind you a helping hand, you need to be well ahead of them and have
  a firm grip. But the higher up you go in the media, government,
  entertainment or corporate worlds, the fewer women you’ll find. In 2010,
  for example, 2.5 per cent of ASX 200 chairmen and 3 per cent of chief
  executives were women. Just 30 per cent of parliamentarians are female
  and far fewer of these have safe seats or ministerial posts.
  
  Some women who have managed to scrape their way to the top don’t feel
  secure enough for generosity. They’ve done the sums and, in contrast to
  their male counterparts, they know they’re competing with junior women
  for the scarce, even token, spots allocated for females.
  
  The generation gap is not the only one that divides women. What about
  women-led social movements with anti-women agendas? Whether it’s
  fundamentalist religious movements striving to return pregnant and
  economically dependent women to the home, or political parties dedicated
  to cutting funding to child care and food aid for the children of the
  mostly female poor, women can be well-represented among those driving
  and supporting laws that deny their own sex autonomy and dignity.
  
  Perhaps they are in denial. To work towards advancing the interests of
  her sex, a woman must admit that sexism exists and is crimping her own
  life chances. Some women are loath to do this, especially when the only
  sensible corrective is to steal time from the pursuit of her personal
  ambitions to assume the gargantuan task of changing the world.
  
  While not admirable, I can understand the woman who wishes so hard that
  she had the freedom to simply get on with living her life in the same
  way she can see her male siblings and friends doing that she convinces
  herself that she does.
  
  As a repentant young woman recently explained of her former pro-life
  stance, “Because I was saving myself for marriage . . . I knew that I
  would . . . never be a murderer like those sluts.” Insisting one is
  different, special and more virtuous than other women - and so not in
  need of the social salves they seek - is the act of a fragile ego. But
  it also speaks poignant volumes about the yearning all humans have to
  duck obstacles of bias and discrimination and gain a respected place in
  society on their own steam.

  We are now entering the second year of the DikiLeaks scandal. The story
  began in February last year when St Kilda AFL player Sam Gilbert and
  other players attended a school clinic in Melbourne where they met a
  16-year-old student. A month later, in another city while competing in
  an athletics competition, the girl hooked up with the players at a
  hotel. She had sex with one player and soon became Gilbert’s girlfriend.
  
  In May the teen told her school principal that she was pregnant with
  twins by Gilbert. He reported it but by the end of the month both the
  AFL and police investigations concluded that no inappropriate or illegal
  activity occurred.
  
  In September the teen began meeting agent Ricky Nixon at his office.
  About this time the girl began spruiking the nude photos of St Kilda
  players but, finding no takers, uploaded the images to Facebook. Gilbert
  launched a lawsuit and St Kilda vice-president Ross Levin vowed to make
  her pay.
  
  After a text message correspondence Nixon visited the teen in a city
  hotel. She alleged drug-taking and an affair. A QC investigation was
  begun but the findings were pre-empted by Nixon’s admission of a
  substance abuse problem and his recent decision to step down.
  
  Some good-hearted commentators have been worrying about the girl, who
  they see as a vulnerable child unable to make informed and voluntary
  choices. They assume her actions to date have been mistakes and express
  dread about “permanent consequences”.
  
  Part of their worry is the intersection of the age-old tale of
  boy-humiliates-girl, girl-goes-for-jugular, with new media platforms
  that reveal, amplify and archive every indiscretion. I worry, too, but
  also wonder whether based on the evidence to date, might we be
  catastrophising a bit? Could sexist ideas about reputation and
  risk-taking be clouding our judgment?
  
  The teen does appear to have been victimized by several men in positions
  of authority, but she’s also claimed some scalps. While vengeance is
  never edifying, it occupies a prominent place in the moral landscape of
  most teens, offering a means to overcome humiliation and save face. On a
  scorecard of her own making, she’s arguably one up.
  
  Yes, this girl is taking risks - lots of them. Worse, she’s doing it in
  a world changing so fast that the full dimensions of a worst-case
  outcome can’t really be fully assessed.
  
  But teens have always been risk-takers and society always less forgiving
  of the risks young women tend to take (often with sex, risking unwanted
  pregnancy, sexual assault) compared with those taken by young men
  (drinking too much, driving too fast).
  
  Interestingly, just as more young women embrace “male” risks, social
  tolerance for such risk-taking is declining. That’s OK, but we need to
  be gender-equitable in our opprobrium, and realistic about the capacity
  of the adolescent brain to make the assessments fundamental to prudent
  choice.
  
  This is the precise point of the worriers. But the truth is that the law
  deems most seventeen year olds competent to authorize their own medical
  treatment because they have the ability to understand that there is a
  choice, and that all choices have consequences. From that we might
  conclude she’s like mature enough to make choices and wear
  responsibility for them in other areas of life, too.
  
  The St Kilda teen has flown the nest. I wish her the best.

  *Civil rights, women’s rights, gay rights… it’s all wrong. Call in the
  cavalry to disrupt this perception of freedom gone wild. God damn it!
  First one wants freedom, then the whole damn world wants freedom.*
  
  - Lyrics from “B Movie” by Gil Scott-Heron.
  
  TEASE: Over the long weekend just past, there were several breakouts
  from the Christmas Island detention centre. Also, a 300 strong protest
  that officials said was a riot and quelled with beanbag rounds. Labor’s
  Immigration Minister Chris Bowen accused some of the asylum seekers of
  waging an “orchestrated campaign.”
  
  Christmas Island Shire President Gordon Thompson, speaking on ABC radio,
  agreed. He said the detainees on Christmas Island had set out “to make a
  peaceful protest,” going “into the community to be seen and to be
  heard”. Their purpose? To “draw media attention to their plight.” A
  plight that, according to refugee advocates, includes severe
  overcrowding at the facility (built for 500 people, it now houses more
  than 2,500) and extended delays in visas, including those already deemed
  refugees.
  
  The Shire President went on to say that having met with the asylum
  seekers, his impression was that “a fairly strategic approach was taken
  to protests.” He continued. “These people have come here with the
  purpose of getting a visa… They’re forging a path for their families to
  follow… The primary motivation of the protests is to get attention to
  their plight and to have their situation resolved one way or another.”
  
  Like many Australians, I have been following the national debate about
  asylum-seekers arriving by boat since it became a partisan issue during
  the Howard years. I remember well the dead-fish tones of then
  Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock insinuating that all attempts by
  refugees to achieve a “desired migration outcome” were - and should
  rightly be viewed by the community - as manipulative of our emotions,
  Australian law, or both.
  
  We saw this back in 2000 when senior government ministers including
  Ruddock and Prime Minister John Howard said that asylum seekers had
  thrown their children overboard, claims that would later be shown to be
  false - and to have been known to be false by those making them.
  
  The intent of the charges seemed be to undermine the character of boat
  people. What sort of human beings would throw their own children
  overboard at all, little less for the purpose of manipulating the good
  nature of Australians, and our soft-hearted laws, to achieve a migration
  outcome? Ruddock called it “one of the most disturbing incidents he’d
  heard of in his public life” while Howard said, “I certainly don’t want
  people of that type in Australia, I really don’t.”
  
  For both men, and the audiences to which they were playing, the attempt
  by asylum seekers to incite our sympathy invalidated their claim to it.
  To the contrary, we were entitled to feel aggrieved by their overtures
  and to draw negative inferences about the characters of those who would
  “try it on” in such a way. Peter Mares traces this attitude back to the
  late 19th century when the growth of China’s population led some
  Australians to argue we were at risk of being overrun by more
  “calculating and ruthless Asians.”
  
  All this is confusing to those who are across the theory of non-violent
  action, which includes passive resistance, peaceful demonstrations,
  petitions and boycotts. All non-aggressive physical methods aimed at
  awakening moral conscience in observers and - to paraphrase Martin
  Luther King Jr - persuading the opponent of the justice of your case.
  
  Odder still is our enthusiasm for such methods when used by those on
  foreign soil. From Gandhi to the students in Tiananmen Square to
  organizers of recent uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, Australians
  have supported disciplined concerted non-violent political action to
  draw the eyes of the world to those with a political cause, and spark an
  impulse to help.
  
  So why when the orchestrated campaign is in our own backyard do we
  baulk? Is it simply resistance to the terrible truth that sometimes we
  are not the freedom-seekers but the oppressors? Is it as Gil Scott-Heron
  suggests, that we talk a good game about freedom and democracy but are
  in fact anxious about the rapid flowering of a world in which everyone
  wants freedom and knows how to get it?
