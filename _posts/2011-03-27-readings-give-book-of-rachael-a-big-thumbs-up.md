  content: "Dr Leslie Cannold is an impressive and formidable writer. Her latest offering,
    The Book of Rachael, her first novel, takes what we think we know and turns it
    on its head. No surprises there: Cannold is considered one of Australiaâ\x80\x99s
    top 20 leading intellectuals. Her lifeâ\x80\x99s work is about making you think
    and her previous works, The Abortion Myth and What, No Baby? spoke to generations
    of women. Both works showed where women have been stopped and why.\r\n\r\nThe
    Book of Rachael does the same. However, with this novel Dr Cannold returns to
    the beginnings of the Second Testament. The story is set in Nazareth in 30AD and
    tells the story of Jesusâ\x80\x99 younger sister, Rachael, who is ambitious and
    passionate and chooses to be unhindered by her culture. This is quite an extraordinary
    situation, given the time and place of this novel. The brutality of womenâ\x80\x99s
    lives is not hidden in this book. (There are some deeply disturbing passages.)
    These women do not have choices. Education, language and politics are not part
    of their lives. Rachael, however, is not going to accept her rank. She falls in
    love with Judah of Iscariot, Josephâ\x80\x99s best friend â\x80\x93 and it is
    this person who changes the shape of biblical history as we know it.\r\n\r\nThe
    Book of Rachael is not just a feminist rewriting of the past, though. Essentially,
    it is a love story about courageous people. It is fastpaced and the narrative
    is superb. One can only imagine the amount of research needed to achieve such
    an ode to a time passed. This novel is not going to make everyone happy â\x80\x93
    it is controversial and brave â\x80\x93 but, dear readers, it is a work of fiction.
    How brilliant that Cannoldâ\x80\x99s move to fiction has not marred her ability
    to ensure the reader thinks twice, and then speaks out."
