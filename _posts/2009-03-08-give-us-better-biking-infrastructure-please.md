    woman in the car hadnâ\x80\x99t meant any harm. She had only just parked and\r\nwas
    now hurrying on her way, probably wondering if she had enough coins\r\nin her
    wallet for the meter, if the space sheâ\x80\x99d just backed into was\r\ntruly
    legal, and if she still had time to avoid being late.\r\n\r\nBut I was on a bike
    and when her door flung open, I had only seconds to\r\napply the breaks. I screamed.
    She apologized. Another day commuting to\r\nwork in the city.\r\n\r\nI ride my
    bike most places these days. Itâ\x80\x99s good for my health, my\r\nwallet and
    the environment. Some bike-riders are as bad as\r\nex-smokers-insufferable, morally
    over-inflated bores. I try not to be\r\none of those. I know that not everyone
    can ride, and few can ride all\r\nthe time. This afternoon, my kids have footy
    training and Iâ\x80\x99ll use the\r\ncar.\r\n\r\nBut more people are cycling these
    days. Not for recreation - though this\r\nis happening too-but to get where theyâ\x80\x99re
    going. Since 2001, thereâ\x80\x99s\r\nbeen a nearly 30% average increase in Australians
    cycling to work. An\r\nincrease in commuter cyclists benefits us all. One less
    sweaty body in\r\nthe tram or train; one less car clogging up the road at peak
    hour; one\r\nless person straining the public health system with a physical or
    mental\r\nhealth problem that regular exercise might have prevented; one less\r\nperson
    contributing to air and noise pollution, road trauma and\r\ncongestion in our
    capital cities; one less person emitting greenhouse\r\ngases that contribute to
    dangerous climate change-and the list goes on.\r\n\r\nYet the support of Australian
    governments of all persuasions for\r\nbringing Australiaâ\x80\x99s commuter cycling
    infrastructure into the 21st\r\ncentury ranges from paltry to piss-weak. My near-death
    experience would\r\nalmost certainly have been avoided if I had been traveling
    in a\r\nCopenhagen-style lane, commuter paths ubiquitous in the city that gives\r\nthem
    their name, which keep cyclists separate from moving traffic. I\r\nalso owe several
    close calls to what I call magician lanes: bike lanes\r\nthat simply disappear
    in the middle of four-lane traffic and magically\r\nreappear further down the
    road. What do they expect us to do,\r\nde-materilise?\r\n\r\nBut Copenhagen lanes
    are scarcer than henâ\x80\x99s teeth in Australian capital\r\ncities and magician
    lanes far too common. The consequence is that more\r\npeople than necessary risk
    fright, injury and even death when riding,\r\nand that men will continue to make
    up the majority of those cycling to\r\nwork because most women refuse to consider
    commuting an extreme sport.\r\n\r\nWhy is Australiaâ\x80\x99s biking infrastructure
    so poor? The answer is that\r\ndespite regular calls for us to reduce the size
    of our waists and our\r\ncarbon footprint, few governments have been willing to
    show commuter\r\ncyclists the money. Melbourne is the happiest story, and it has
    only\r\ncompleted 35% of the bike network begun in the early 1990s. Sydney is\r\namongst
    the saddest. Despite having many of the factors know to\r\nencourage cycling-congested
    roads, short distances between destinations,\r\nhigh parking costs-fewer Sydney-siders
    than residents of most other\r\nAustralian cities cycle to work because the cityâ\x80\x99s
    infrastructure is so\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nWhat can you do? Ride when you can. Thereâ\x80\x99s
    safety in numbers and we\r\nneed your voice in the chorus for change. When you
    drive and park, watch\r\nout for cyclists.\r\n\r\nBe part of the solution, whether
