    was the most painful experience of my life. I did it both\r\ntimes without any
    pain relief beyond nitrous oxide gas, but only the\r\nfirst time was by choice.
    The second time, had I been able to choose, I\r\nwould have had an epidural, or
    at least some pethidine or morphine.\r\n\r\nI didnâ\x80\x99t have a choice because
    I was cared for exclusively by midwives\r\nin a birth centre. I liked the birth
    centre, and I liked laboring under\r\nthe care of midwives who had looked after
    me during my pregnancy.\r\nBecause I didnâ\x80\x99t regard either of my low-risk
    pregnancies as illnesses,\r\nI felt there was no reason for my labor to be overseen
    by doctors in a\r\nhospital ward.\r\n\r\nBut while the birth centre I attended,
    like most in Australia, had\r\n\\`\\`standing ordersâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 to provide
    me with gas, I had to reconsider my\r\noptions when I wanted more serious painkillers.
    I could remain at the\r\nbirth centre under the care of the midwives I knew and
    trusted - and\r\naccept what I saw as unacceptable amounts of pain - or I could
    transfer\r\nto a hospital ward and into the primary care of doctors I didnâ\x80\x99t
    know,\r\nin order to get the pain relief I wanted. Some choice!\r\n\r\nWhile most
    Victorian women labor under the care of midwives, only a tiny\r\npercentage have
    midwives as their primary carers.\r\n\r\nA recent national report has called for
    resources to be made available\r\nto address the unmet demand for birth centres
    in every state. In\r\naddition, doctors will face increasing pressure to allow
    midwives to\r\nassume the status of primary carer for all women having normal,
    low-risk\r\nbirths.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons doctors are under pressure to cede
    more of the\r\nresponsibility for normal births to midwives is because of what
    the\r\nWorld Health Organisation considers unacceptably high levels of\r\nintervention
    in births, where the doctor calls the shots.\r\n\r\nWHO believes 85 per cent of
    women should give birth without any\r\nintervention, Australian women have a significantly
    higher intervention\r\nrate.\r\n\r\nOpposition to intervention in normal births
    has come from a number of\r\ngroups. One such group is a coalition of midwives
    and mothers and forms\r\npart of what is known as the \\`\\`natural childbirth
    movementâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nHistorically, this movementâ\x80\x99s embrace
    of intervention-free birth and\r\nexclusive breastfeeding as \\`\\`natural\" and
    \\`\\`best for babyâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 has been\r\npart of an overall belief in
    the natural capacity of women to give birth\r\nto, feed and care for children.\r\n\r\nThese
    beliefs support a view that in most cases pain relief, like most\r\nbirth interventions,
    is unnatural and unnecessary, damaging for the baby\r\nand can possibly disrupt
    the natural bonding process that occurs at\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\nFeminists are longstanding
    - though strange - bedfellows of the natural\r\nchildbirth movement. Feminists
    also seek less medical intervention in\r\nchildbirth, but their objection to intervention
    is that it strips women\r\nof their \\`\\`controlâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 of the birth
    process.\r\n\r\nMany feminists are unsupportive of pharmacological pain relief
    because\r\nit deprives women of an \\`\\`activeâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99 and \\`\\`consciousâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99
    birth and is\r\nthe tool of the enemy - the medical profession that usurped the
    control\r\nfemale healers and midwives once had over birth.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    both groups have practical and ideological reasons for their\r\nless than enthusiastic
    stance on pain-relief drugs. The reality is that\r\nthe current range of pain-relief
    drugs can disrupt a womanâ\x80\x99s labor,\r\nleading to a \\`\\`cascadeâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99
    of unwanted interventions such as a drip to\r\nget things moving again, a baby
    suffering respiratory distress and/or a\r\nforceps or caesarean delivery.\r\n\r\nBut
    having defined a woman-centred/feminist birth as free from\r\npharmacological
    pain relief, both natural childbirth advocates and\r\nfeminists tend to minimise
    the pain of labor by employing euphemisms\r\nsuch as \\`\\`intensityâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99,
    and exaggerate the efficacy of the\r\nnon-pharmacological forms of pain relief
    such as baths and massages, or\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nWhile I can see how this happened,
    I canâ\x80\x99t support it. Any group batting\r\nfor women must accept that some
    of us want a less interventionist and\r\nmore woman-centred birth, and the best
    pain-relieving drugs money can\r\nbuy.\r\n\r\nNot only should natural childbirth
    advocates and feminists fight for the\r\nright to dispense such drugs to informed
    and consenting women, they\r\nshould put their considerable skills and energies
    into fighting for a\r\nbetter choice of pain relief than what is now available.\r\n\r\nAlthough
    I would have taken what was on offer, my real choice would have\r\nbeen a drug
    that effectively managed my pain, but also had a negligible\r\nimpact both on
    my foetus and the course of my labor.\r\n\r\nPain is not noble, and it is not
    \\`\\`intensityâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99. It is pain, and it\r\nsucks. Women should be
    given a choice about the sort of pain relief they\r\nwant.\r\n\r\nIf they decide
    to have drugs, they should have the right for the drugs\r\nto be delivered by
    the carer of their choice - be it a midwife or a\r\ndoctor. Those who want to
    take the pharmacological option need a wider\r\nrange of choices than those currently
    available.\r\n\r\nA woman-centred approach to birth is about expanding womenâ\x80\x99s
    rights and\r\nchoices, and having effective pain-relieving drugs during labor
    is as\r\nlegitimate a choice as any other."
