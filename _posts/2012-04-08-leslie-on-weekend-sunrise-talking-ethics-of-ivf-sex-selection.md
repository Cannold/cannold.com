title: Leslie on Weekend Sunrise talking ethics of IVF & Sex-selection
---
Britain's [trailblazing gay dads](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/britains-first-gay-dads-planning-768457) make their desire of for child number six to be female - and their intention to use IVF/PGD to achieve it - public. In this segment on [Weekend Sunrise](http://au.tv.yahoo.com/sunrise/weekend-sunrise/), Leslie raises concerns about the consumerist frivolity of sex selection, until equality of access has been won for less well-off, single and gay couples to IVF/PGD to do what is was created for - help infertile couples have kids and avoid the birth of children with hereditary health problems.
