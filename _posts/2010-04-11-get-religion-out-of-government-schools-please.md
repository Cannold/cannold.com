    education of her daughter, who began kindergarten this year. The\r\nfamily doesnâ\x80\x99t
    believe in â\x80\x9Cstructured religionâ\x80\x9D, preferring instead to\r\nraise
    their children as â\x80\x9Ctolerant of all religions but followers of\r\nnoneâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nFor
    this reason, she refused her childâ\x80\x99s participation in scripture\r\ninstruction
    offered by the school.\r\n\r\nBut the five-year-old was the only child in her
    year to be excused from\r\nthe lesson and so was forced to sit alone outside the
    classroom while it\r\nproceeded. The little girl was so distressed that her mother
    - letâ\x80\x99s\r\ncall her Karen - reluctantly gave permission for her to attend
    Anglican\r\nscripture. But the decision doesnâ\x80\x99t feel right and sheâ\x80\x99s
    still not sure\r\nthat it is. What should she do?\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99m not sure
    what part of this dilemma astounded or offended me more.\r\nThat in 2010 supposedly
    secular schools are teaching religion or that\r\nparents who see such tutelage
    as inappropriate or inconsistent with\r\ntheir personal values or minority religion
    beliefs must choose between\r\nraising their kids as they see fit or being party
    to their symbolic\r\ncasting out.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought this story, however
    sad, must be one out of the box.\r\nA one-off predicament that bore no relationship
    to the parenting\r\nexperience of the divinely challenged raising kids in NSW.
    But I was\r\nwrong. The basic elements of Karenâ\x80\x99s story, and the ethical
    dilemma to\r\nwhich they give rise, is one facing about one in four families with\r\nschool-age
    kids (the Education Department does not keep statistics on\r\nthe exact number
    of kids who refuse religious education).\r\n\r\nSome of these parents tell their
    stories on a Facebook site dedicated to\r\nthe issue, revealing heartbreaking
    tales of primary-age children forced\r\nto sit alone in a photocopying room while
    the rest of the class learned\r\nreligion, or of being denied the right to undertake
    even the most\r\ninnocuous time-killing activities - like knitting - when religious\r\nparents
    complained to the school that their kids were coming home with\r\npleas to escape
    scripture so they could do the same.\r\n\r\nThe origins of the problem date back
    to the 1800s, when the newly\r\nemergent state government brokered a deal with
    the churches. In exchange\r\nfor loosening the stranglehold Christians had on
    education services, the\r\nprovider - the state - would dedicate an hour for religious
    studies each\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nReligious groups could choose a member of the clergy
    or any instructor\r\nthey liked to teach children, well, anything they wished.
    Such as God\r\nmade Adam and Eve and all the world. Or that Jesus put mud in someoneâ\x80\x99s\r\neye
    and that man could see again.\r\n\r\nWhile the Education Act of 1990 gave parents
    the right to opt out for\r\ntheir children, it prohibited such students being
    offered timetabled\r\nlessons or scheduled school activities.\r\n\r\nSo where
    does this Faustian pact leave parents like Karen? Between a\r\nrock and a hard
    place, which is why I have no problem with them making\r\nwhatever short-term
    decision they feel necessary to protect their\r\nchildrenâ\x80\x99s psychological
    and emotional health. Children should never be\r\nsacrificed on the altar of their
    parentsâ\x80\x99 principles.\r\n\r\nBut in the long-term Karen, and others like
    her, must fight. Beat on the\r\ndoor of the Education Minister until she amends
    the departmentâ\x80\x99s policy\r\nthat prescribes suitable alternatives being
    provided for kids whose\r\nparents say no to scripture. So that no parent, or
    child, has to endure\r\nwhat theyâ\x80\x99ve had to again."
