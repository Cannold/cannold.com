    ends, insults fly, but most of the time the real\r\nknock-down drag-outs are about
    cash, even when thereâ\x80\x99s more than enough\r\nto go around.\r\n\r\nSome
    might say this is to be expected. After all, money is what married\r\ncouples
    argue about most. Why would things be different when they split?\r\n\r\nBefore
    I answer this, I need to confess. I am the child of divorce. My\r\nparents finally
    divorced after 11 years of unhappy matrimony\r\ninterspersed with several failed
    separations. They moved from disputes\r\nabout custody to brawls about money that
    only ended (or I think they\r\ndid, anyway) when I left home. Iâ\x80\x99ve also
    been divorced myself and, like\r\nmost of us, witnessed numerous family members
    and friends follow a\r\nsimilar path.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the view I am about
    to impart is - for better or for\r\nworse -home-grown.\r\n\r\nAnd it is this.
    When estranged partners argue over money, they are\r\nreally talking about emotions.
    Disputes about the sums to be inserted\r\ninto property settlement formulas -
    how much each partner brought to the\r\nmarriage and who contributed what to the
    value of assets accumulated\r\nduring the marriage - are really about far more
    than cash.\r\n\r\nWhy is this so? Whether right or wrong, most of us see divorce
    as a\r\nfailure and with failure comes disappointment, grief and anger.\r\nEspecially
    in the early stages, emotions run high as each partner tries\r\nto work out what
    went wrong and the role they played in the break-up.\r\nPart of this process seems
    to be an accounting for the way that the\r\npersonality and emotional baggage
    the other person brought to the\r\nrelationship, and his or her emotional failures
    during its duration,\r\ncontributed to the marriageâ\x80\x99s demise.\r\n\r\nSee
    the parallel? No wonder that money, a measure of value we all\r\nunderstand, becomes
    a proxy for tallying up all the other person failed\r\nto give us, and all that
    failure cost us, in emotional terms. A proxy\r\nfor summing up the responsibility
    each bears for the dissolution of the\r\npartnership and consequently, how much
    each owes, and must be made to\r\npay.\r\n\r\nThe money-as-emotional-proxy theory
    throws light on why sometimes, even\r\nafter the settlement is done, couples rage
    on. Think of Denise Richards\r\nand Charlie Sheen. It also explains why couples
    would risk the damage to\r\ntheir children and reputations caused by settling
    the issue in court -\r\ninstead of privately - despite the fact that the amount
    one party\r\nrejects as an insult is generous enough for the interest to support
    a\r\nfamily for life in the lap of luxury. Paul McCartney was rumoured to\r\nhave
    offered Heather Mills 10 million to settle out of court.\r\n\r\nBut itâ\x80\x99s
    the principle of the thing, I can hear you say. Yes, I agree,\r\nand that is precisely
    my point. That when divorce happens, battles over\r\nmoney are about points of
    principle, or designed to settle emotional\r\nscores or exact revenge or - at
    a time when self-esteem is low - prove\r\noneâ\x80\x99s worth. But that is not
    how it should be.\r\n\r\nPerhaps instead, estranged couples could look up from
    the shriek-fest\r\nabout the provenance of a pile of CDs or a clothes dryer and
    recognise\r\nthat whether they win or lose that particular battle, the heartache
    they\r\nfeel over their defeat in the war for happy-ever-after will still be\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAnd
    lay down their arms. Especially if there are children listening in."
