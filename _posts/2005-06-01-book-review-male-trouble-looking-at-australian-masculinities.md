  content: "Male Trouble: Looking at Australian Masculinities, edited by Stephen\r\nTomsen
    and Mike Donaldson, Pluto Press, $29.95pb, 254pp, 1 86403 121 2\r\n\r\nIn his
    introduction to this collection of academic essays about\r\ndifferent aspects
    and types of contemporary Australian masculinity or,\r\nas the authors prefer,
    masculinities, R.W. Connell notes that: â\x80\x98It is\r\nnow a familiar observation
    that notions of Australian identity have been\r\nentirely constructed around images
    of men.â\x80\x99\r\n\r\nThis is a familiar observation. Another old chestnut that
    better sums up\r\nrecent discussions of masculinity and men, including this book,
    is that\r\nmasculinity is in â\x80\x98crisisâ\x80\x99, and that, at least in part,
    the solution\r\nlies in â\x80\x98problematisingâ\x80\x99, â\x80\x98deconstructingâ\x80\x99,
    â\x80\x98destablisingâ\x80\x99, and then\r\nâ\x80\x98collapsingâ\x80\x99 it. Itâ\x80\x99s
    all, as such language makes clear, terribly\r\nsociological and cultural studies
    in approach. Which is not beyond\r\ninterest, once one swims beneath the dense
    disciplinary jargon to the\r\nideas beneath.\r\n\r\nBut I must be honest and say,
    as someone who has spent the last few\r\nmonths reading everything I can get my
    hands on about masculinity, that\r\nI have begun to feel somewhat downtrodden
    by the relentless negativity\r\nabout all things male that seems to be the sine
    qua non of such research\r\nand â\x80\x98discourseâ\x80\x99. Men, this collection
    argues, continue to â\x80\x98constructâ\x80\x99\r\ntheir masculinity through the
    degradation of the female and homosexual;\r\nmen pursue submissive wives using
    Internet sites that traffic poor women\r\nfrom the developing world; men murder
    men who insult their masculinity\r\nthrough homosexual advance to preserve their
    honour and self-respect;\r\nthe â\x80\x98hyper-masculineâ\x80\x99 male sporting
    body continues to dominate sports\r\ncoverage, while the sexual objectification
    of the female sporting body\r\ncontinues unabated. And on it goes. I can only
    imagine the impact such a\r\nrelentless list of â\x80\x98male troublesâ\x80\x99
    has on readers of the opposite sex.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, a more attentive reading
    of many of the chapters - each\r\nauthored by academics from different institutions
    - reveals numerous\r\npossibilities for optimism. While some members of the Australian
    navy\r\nare doing their best to preserve the military as a place where dominant\r\nforms
    of masculinity are made, Katerina Agostinoâ\x80\x99s research reveals how\r\nothers
    welcome women (though they often refuse to express their support\r\nfor fear of
    being â\x80\x98deprived of their gender status as menâ\x80\x99). In a\r\nchapter
    on the â\x80\x98masculinising institutionâ\x80\x99 of Aussie Rules, Nikki\r\nWedgwood
    speaks of several young men who refuse to denigrate women or to\r\nuse violence
    on the field to subordinate other males and so assert their\r\nmanhood. Indeed,
    as Gary Dowsett wisely notes in his discussion of\r\nâ\x80\x98Masculinity, (homo)sexuality
    and contemporary sexual politicsâ\x80\x99, some\r\nmen are responding to the challenges
    social and economic changes have\r\npresented to male power and privilege:\r\n\r\nOf
    course, some men have not changed at all and others are too powerful\r\nto have
    to bother. But some sections of the male population have faced\r\nup squarely
    to the challenge of feminism and adjusted significantly. Not\r\nall men are unwilling
    to change, but the process of change is difficult,\r\neven when it is willingly
    pursued.\r\n\r\nMale Trouble seems to see itself as advancing the project of â\x80\x98reforming\r\nmasculinitiesâ\x80\x99
    in two ways. Firstly, by contributing to recent public\r\ndebates about â\x80\x98men,
    boys and masculinitiesâ\x80\x99, and, secondly, by\r\npresenting cutting-edge
    social research to assist in the development of\r\nâ\x80\x98agendas of change
    in arenas from health policy to family violence to\r\nprimary educationâ\x80\x99.
    Taken on its own terms, it seems important to ask\r\nhow well it accomplishes
    these tasks.\r\n\r\nI offer qualified ticks on both counts. As Connell notes,
    much public\r\ndebate about men and masculinity is marred by reactionary ideas.
    The\r\nprogressive outlook offered by the authors of this collection, who veer\r\naway
    from psychological explanations for â\x80\x98all the nasty things men doâ\x80\x99\r\nand
    focus instead on â\x80\x98institutions, power relations, and social\r\ninequalitiesâ\x80\x99,
    warms the chill of the current individualistic and\r\nbiologically determinant
    political landscape. In particular, the use by\r\nmost authors of the terms â\x80\x98hegemonicâ\x80\x99
    to preserve the hierarchies\r\namongst men and resultant differences in masculinities
    was welcome.\r\n\r\nI did wish the authors had put more effort into making their
    arguments\r\nin plain English. This was the case firstly because, in several\r\ninstances,
    I suspected that jargon was not functioning in its proper\r\nrole as in-group
    shorthand, but, rather, obscuring a lack of analytical\r\nprecision and depth.
    As well, if - as Connell seems to want -\r\nmasculinity research is to impact
    on policy, lucid writing and material\r\norganisation is essential. Indeed, all
    readers, lay or academic, would\r\nhave benefited from a standard format for each
    article in which the\r\nimpetus for the work, and its place in the literature,
    its method,\r\nresults and conclusions were all clearly laid out. Insofar as the\r\ncollection
    makes no bones about being for academic audiences only, I\r\nwould have preferred
    abstracts at the start of each piece and notes at\r\nthe end of each chapter,
    rather than collected at the back of the book.\r\n\r\nThe collection does provide
    some new and interesting research. I was\r\nparticularly fascinated by Poynting,
    Noble and Tabarâ\x80\x99s discussion of\r\nâ\x80\x98Protest masculinity and Lebanese
    youth in western Sydneyâ\x80\x99. The authors\r\npresent fascinating extracts
    from interviews with seven Lebanese youth,\r\nwhich show how â\x80\x98protestâ\x80\x99
    masculinities are formed through intersections\r\nof class, gender and ethnicity.
    Mike Donaldsonâ\x80\x99s chapter, â\x80\x98Studying up:\r\nthe masculinity of
    the hegemonicâ\x80\x99, looks at the lives of ruling-class\r\nmen - a rarity in
    sociological research, which specialises in what one\r\nresearcher called â\x80\x98taking
    notebook and conscience in hand and going\r\nslummingâ\x80\x99 - in order to investigate
    the workings of power from another\r\nangle, and to explore â\x80\x98the extent
    to which men of great power have some\r\ninsight into the mechanics of its influenceâ\x80\x99."
