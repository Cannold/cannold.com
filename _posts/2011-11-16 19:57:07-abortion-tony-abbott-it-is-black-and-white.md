  content: "How do we judge what someone might do in the future? Usually itâ\x80\x99s
    a combination of what we know theyâ\x80\x99ve done in the past, our judgement
    of their character and how much we trust assurances about what they say theyâ\x80\x99ll
    do.\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99ve wondered about this recently because not long ago Tony
    Abbott told womenâ\x80\x99s website Mamamia that his views on abortion are less
    than black-and-white.\r\n\r\nThis claim implied he has been misunderstood on the
    issue. Some concluded from this that women have nothing to fear from Abbott if
    he becomes PM.\r\n\r\nNone of this makes sense to me. Hereâ\x80\x99s the reason
    why.\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99m an abortion rights activist and have been up against Tony
    Abbott in a number of abortion rights campaigns.\r\n\r\nI clearly remember the
    speech Abbott gave to the Adelaide University Democratic Club in 2004 that effectively
    put a womanâ\x80\x99s right (or lack thereof ) to choose abortion back on the
    political agenda.\r\nIn it he described the â\x80\x9Cpractice of abortionâ\x80\x9D
    as â\x80\x9Can objectively grave matter [that] has been reduced to a question
    of the motherâ\x80\x99s convenience,â\x80\x9D and wondered whether it was â\x80\x9Creally
    so hard to create a culture where people understand that actions have consequences
    and take their responsibilities seriously?â\x80\x9D (Given he was speaking of
    abortion, we can assume the â\x80\x9Cpeopleâ\x80\x9D in question here are the
    female sort).\r\n\r\nThe speech remains on his website to this day titled â\x80\x9CRate
    of Abortion Highlights Our Moral Failingsâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nDuring the RU486 debate
    in federal parliament, in which Abbott fought tooth and nail to hold on to his
    ministerial veto over a drug that is on the World Health Organisationâ\x80\x99s
    list of â\x80\x9Cessential medicines,â\x80\x9D Abbott shouted: â\x80\x9CMr Speaker,
    we have a bizarre double standard in this country where someone who kills a pregnant
    womanâ\x80\x99s baby is guilty of murder, but a woman aborts an unborn baby is
    simply exercising choice.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nI was in the chamber when the Prime
    Minister John Howard, Tony Abbott and other opponents of reproductive rights became
    aware they would lose the conscience vote on the issue.\r\n\r\nThey began using
    their speeches to alert their supporters in the gallery the Howard governmentâ\x80\x99s
    intention to maintain the shame and stigma surrounding abortion, and to impede
    womenâ\x80\x99s capacity to make informed decisions for themselves.\r\n\r\nJust
    two weeks after RU486 was won, the government announced a $51 million suite of
    aptly named Pregnancy Support Measures designed to reduce the nationâ\x80\x99s
    abortion rate.\r\nThese â\x80\x93 according to the joint press release issued
    by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health Tony Abbott â\x80\x93 included
    a Medicare item number for pregnancy support counselling by GPs (since axed for
    lack of use) and a hotline providing counselling that was described as â\x80\x9Cnon-directiveâ\x80\x9D
    but for which Church agencies could tender, despite the fact that they do not
    provide accurate information about abortion and will not direct women to safe
    services, even if a woman asks.\r\n\r\nTo his credit, the alternative Prime Minister
    has never squibbed the question of the motivation for his anti-choice views and
    actions.\r\n\r\nThey come from his adherence to a highly orthodox version of Catholicism.
    As he said in his Adelaide Club speech and at a number of different points since,
    Abbott believes that â\x80\x9CChristians in politicsâ\x80\x9D do not have to â\x80\x9Csell
    out their principles in order to surviveâ\x80\x9D.\r\nInstead Catholics must work
    together, he said at a launch of a book of his mentor B.A. Santamariaâ\x80\x99s
    letters, to turn back â\x80\x9Cthe tide of secular humanismâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nI
    could go on, but this seems enough to demonstrate that Abbottâ\x80\x99s views
    on abortion â\x80\x93 and his related political behaviour â\x80\x93 are entirely
    black and white.\r\n\r\nNuance-free, in fact.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Abbott has described
    them this way himself. â\x80\x9CWhen it comes to lobbying local politicians,â\x80\x9D
    he said in a speech, â\x80\x9Cthere seems to be far more interest in the treatment
    of boatpeople, which is not morally black and white, than in the question of abortion.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nSo,
    how can we make sense of Abbottâ\x80\x99s claims that he is misunderstood on the
    abortion issue?\r\nOne option is that he has indeed had a sudden and abrupt change
    of heart on the issue, or has even lost his Catholic faith.\r\n\r\nThat when it
    comes to abortion, his views have substantially changed.\r\n\r\nThe other option
    is that he was not being truthful when he implied such a change of heart, but
    was putting this idea forward to cultivate female voters who, not surprisingly,
    view him with a high degree of suspicion.\r\n\r\nBoth options cast aspersions
    on Abbottâ\x80\x99s character.\r\n\r\nIf he has indeed had a volte face on the
    abortion issue or on his faith, it would up-end everything weâ\x80\x99ve come
    to know about him over many years of public life â\x80\x93 first as leader of
    Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy and then for 17 years in parliament.\r\n\r\nSay
    what you like about Abbott, but one of his core strengths is that the electorate
    sees a unity in what he believes, says and does.\r\n\r\nThey may not like what
    he stands for, but they believe he stands for something and feel they know what
    it is.\r\n\r\nThis sort of credibility is rolled gold for politicians â\x80\x93
    Bob Hawke had it, and so did John Howard. In some cases, it can even win over
    voters who feel compensated enough by the solidity of character and predictability
    such consistency suggests to overlook disagreements on substantive issues.\r\n\r\nIf
    Abbott were to suddenly turn on values heâ\x80\x99s held so strongly, so loudly
    and for so long, it could destroy this electoral asset in a way that may not be
    redeemable.\r\n\r\nIf on the other hand he was telling self-serving porky pies
    this simply adds to the growing view â\x80\x93 \r\narticulated by Andrew Wilkie
    in his reporting of Abbottâ\x80\x99s bargaining style after the last election
    â\x80\x93 that Abbott will say and do anything to win office, and so the truth
    of such claims â\x80\x93 even those pledged in blood or put in writing â\x80\x93
    is highly dubious.\r\n\r\nAbbott could settle the matter by spelling out â\x80\x93
    in a published opinion piece in one of the mainstream dailies â\x80\x93 the precise
    nature of his views on abortion.\r\n\r\nSuch a piece would allow him to reveal
    the claimed nuances of his position and â\x80\x93 importantly â\x80\x93 spell
    out his plans for the protection and enhancement of womenâ\x80\x99s reproductive
    rights, including their right to choose abortion â\x80\x93 should he win government.
    \ (I have been sending him tweets requesting he do just this, but so far with
    little luck. Feel free to add your voice He's [@TonyAbbottMHR](http://twitter.com/#!/TonyAbbottMHR).)\r\n\r\nIf
    we canâ\x80\x99t get it in writing â\x80\x93 and remember Abbott told the 7:30
    Report scripted statements from him are the only ones we should trust â\x80\x93
    we must go with what we know.\r\nAnd what we know is that Abbott has a long history
    as an extremely devout and obedient Catholic and an outspoken and extremely active
    anti-choice politician.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of compelling evidence otherwise
    â\x80\x93 and so far we have none â\x80\x93 we must assume Abbott is still a devout
    Catholic and still holds anti-choice views that he will feel obliged to act on
    once he becomes PM.\r\n\r\nIt is vital women consider this, and cast their votes
