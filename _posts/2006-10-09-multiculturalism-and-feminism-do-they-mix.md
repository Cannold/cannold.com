    paperâ\x80\x99s 175th anniversary.*\r\n\r\nDo multiculturalism and feminism mix?
    What about feminism and\r\nreligious freedom?\r\n\r\nOne could be forgiven for
    having doubts. In a range of pluralist,\r\nliberal states - Australia included
    - pockets of cultural and religious\r\nminorities engage in practices that express
    limited views about the full\r\nhumanity of women, and undermine equity between
    the sexes. From the\r\ninsistence of pockets of Somali immigrants in the US on
    â\x80\x9Ccircumcisingâ\x80\x9D\r\ntheir infant girls, the refusal of parts of
    the Anglican and Catholic\r\nChurches to ordain women and the appeal to customary
    law by some\r\nAboriginal men to justify child marriage and marital rape, some\r\nreligious
    and cultural sub-communities persevere with practices that\r\nexpress particular
    views about â\x80\x9Cproperâ\x80\x9D roles for women rejected - in\r\ntheory if
    not in practice - by the majority. When criticised, the\r\ndefence that tends
    to be offered, nearly always by a male authority\r\nfigure, is that what is being
    done is an inextricable part of â\x80\x9Cour\r\ncultureâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nThe dilemma
    cannot be solved by a simple appeal to rights. This is\r\nbecause the right to
    pursue oneâ\x80\x99s own conception of the good life free\r\nfrom discrimination
    on the grounds of culture and of gender are\r\nimportant moral rights. Which should
    trump the other when they conflict?\r\nPolitical rights are similarly impotent
    in the face of this conflict,\r\nwith many human rights conventions and anti-discrimination
    protocols\r\nenshrining gender equity as well as freedom of culture and religion.
    The\r\nseven core international human rights treaties, for example, include\r\nthose
    that guarantee the right of self determination to all without\r\nregard to religion,
    as well as those that affirm the equal rights of men\r\nand women.\r\n\r\nSo what
    should be done when the values we hold about cultural and\r\nreligious diversity,
    and our beliefs about equality between the sexes,\r\ncollide? A number of Australian
    politicians have recently made their\r\nviews clear. Members of minority cultures
    or religions can either do as\r\nwe do (or say we do) when it comes to gender
    equity, or go home. â\x80\x9CIf a\r\nperson wants to live under Sharia law there
    are countries where they\r\nmight feel at easeâ\x80\x9D, Treasurer Peter Costello
    recently informed\r\nAustraliaâ\x80\x99s Muslim minority. â\x80\x9CBut not Australiaâ\x80\x9D.
    In a speech to the\r\nSydney Institute earlier this year, Victorian MP Andrew
    Robb argued that\r\nthe successful integration of first and second generation
    Muslims into\r\nAustralia was dependant on these Australians â\x80\x9Cdemonstrat[ing]
    their\r\ncomittmentâ\x80\x9D to, among other things, the â\x80\x9CAustralian valueâ\x80\x9D
    of equality\r\nbetween the sexes.\r\n\r\nSome supporters of multiculturalism -
    many of whom are feminists - have\r\ntaken umbrage at such remarks, which have
    been interpreted as\r\nthinly-veiled racism against Australian Muslims. Certainly
    it was the\r\nfirst time many Australian feminists heard the fair, fat and fifty-ish\r\nmen
    who run the nation even mention the word feminism, little less in\r\nsuch impassioned
    and unequivocal tones.\r\n\r\nYet, beneath this discomfort may have lurked another:
    one grounded in\r\nthe sure knowledge that however unjust the discrimination some
    minority\r\ngroups suffer (the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission handled\r\n167
    complaints of race discrimination in 2004~~05), such groups may also\r\nperpetrate
    injustice~~ systematically and unapologetically - against\r\nâ\x80\x9Ctheirâ\x80\x9D
    girls and women. Whether itâ\x80\x99s Muslim parents forcing their\r\ndaughters
    overseas for an arranged marriage with an (often far older)\r\nco-religionist,
    Orthodox Jewish males thanking God daily for not making\r\nthem women, or leaders
    of the Southern Baptist Convention instructing\r\nfemale congregants to â\x80\x9Csubmit
    themselves graciously to the servant\r\nleadership of their husbandsâ\x80\x9D
    and accept their ordained role of\r\nâ\x80\x9Cmanaging the household and nurturing
    the next generation,â\x80\x9D culture and\r\nreligion are regularly used as defences
    for practices that demean,\r\ndeprive, limit and otherwise oppress women.\r\n\r\nIronically,
    at the same time as girls and women are burdened by the\r\npatriarchal attitudes
    of traditional religious and cultural communities,\r\nthey are also seen as responsible
    for their preservation and\r\nperpetuation. According to one American study, the
    parents of young\r\nmigrant women saw their daughters as more responsible than
    their sons\r\nfor the positive representation and perpetuation of their culture
    and\r\nconsequently legitimately subject to parental control when it came to\r\nwhat
    they wore, their participation in extracurricular and social\r\nactivities, their
    future choices about education and employment and even\r\ntheir decisions about
    when and who to marry. While some girls openly or\r\ncovertly flouted such restrictions,
    others submitted, despite what they\r\nadmitted were high psychic, social and/or
    material costs. Philosopher\r\nSusan Okin tells a story of an Indian student facing
    a forced marriage\r\nthat would preclude her graduation from high school. While
    the 17-year\r\nold admitted that her parentsâ\x80\x99 decision had â\x80\x9Cmessed
    upâ\x80\x9D her dreams and\r\nplans, leaving her â\x80\x9Ctormentedâ\x80\x9D,
    she bristled at her teacherâ\x80\x99s suggestion\r\nthat she might resist. â\x80\x9CIn
    our religion, we have to think of our parents\r\nfirstâ\x80¦I will do it the Muslim
    wayâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nFor Okin, arguably the 20th centuryâ\x80\x99s most eminent
    female philosopher,\r\none solution to the clash between feminism and multiculturalism
    is to\r\nensure female members of religious sub-groups have what she calls\r\nâ\x80\x9Crealistic
    rights of exitâ\x80\x9D. Liberal pluralist societies like Australia\r\nshould
    only tolerate the rights of minority groups to discriminate\r\nagainst women when
    those women are truly free to respond to such\r\ndiscrimination - and the more
    limited life aspirations and achievements\r\nthey entail - to leave the group,
    and build an alterative life\r\nelsewhere. Small-l liberal states that do not
    guarantee this freedom to\r\nall their citizens are guilty of failing to protect
    womenâ\x80\x99s moral right\r\nto choice and control over their lives.\r\n\r\nBut
    the right to escape a community that is oppressive is not enough.\r\nGender-discriminatory
    cultures and religions have a profound impact on\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99s beliefs about
    their legitimate entitlements in this life. If\r\ngirls grow up hearing, as they
    do if they attend some private\r\nfundamentalist Christian schools, that their
    failure to accept a\r\nsubordinate and obedient role in the home leaves the â\x80\x9Cdoors
    open to\r\nSatanâ\x80\x9D, their opportunities to exit are significantly undermined.
    This\r\nis because, to rephrase the Rocky Horror Showâ\x80\x99s Dr. Frank-N-Furter,
    if\r\nyou canâ\x80\x99t see it, you canâ\x80\x99t be it. As a consequence, asserts
    Okin, where\r\nmulticultural practices eviscerate the self-esteem necessary for
    girls\r\nand women to develop their own values and plans, the State is well\r\nwithin
    its bounds to outlaw them. This is particularly the case because\r\nthe alternative
    - that oppressed women can either â\x80\x9Clump it or leaveâ\x80\x9D -\r\nnot
    only deprives women of the opportunity to participate in and enjoy\r\nthe positive
    aspects of their cultures, it more or less ensures the\r\nentrenchment in such
    cultures of gender-oppressive attitudes and\r\nbehaviour. After all, if the women
    who object to them have no other\r\noption but to leave, itâ\x80\x99s hard to
    see from where the force for change\r\nwill come.\r\n\r\nAn emphasis not just
    on the obligation of liberal states to equip girls\r\nand women from minority
    cultures to exit, but to ensure the conditions\r\nexist for them to stay, is likely
    to draw fierce resistance from some\r\nminority cultural and religious groups.
    The leaders of such groups may\r\nbrand as culturally imperialist claims that
    particular practices (like\r\ndistinctive and highly restrictive female dress
    and education\r\nemphasising traditional gender roles and sexual morality) are
    oppressive\r\nto women, and insist that â\x80\x9Ctheirâ\x80\x9D women freely choose
    to engage in them.\r\nWhere practices less open to interpretation are at issue
    - like female\r\ngenital mutilation, or forced child marriages - they may argue
    that\r\ncultural expression and survival must take priority over gender\r\nequality.\r\n\r\nPhilosopher
    Ayelet Shachar has observed that â\x80\x9Ca disproportionate share\r\nof the costs
    of multiculturalismâ\x80\x9D is born by the most vulnerable groups\r\nin the community:
    children, women and homosexuals. Shacharâ\x80\x99s point,\r\nobvious but often
    overlooked, is that minority cultural and religious\r\ngroups are not homogeneous,
    but comprise less and more powerful members.\r\nThis is something to keep in mind
    when the most powerful members insist\r\non majority toleration of a practice
    that results in the least powerful\r\ncopping it sweet.\r\n\r\nA focus on exit
    rights, and the conditions necessary to stay, is not\r\nreally as radical as it
    may sound. When we insist that that the\r\nperpetrators of domestic violence,
    not the victims, leave the family\r\nhome, or applaud court decisions that prohibit
    religious schools from\r\nfiring married women because of their view that they
    belong at home, we\r\nendorse an Okin-esque view that a truly just society doesnâ\x80\x99t
    just\r\nsupport its citizens to escape injustice by leaving, but helps them to\r\nfight
    it, so they can stay.\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s these battlers, after all, who make
    the world a more just place for\r\nus all."

  What about feminism and\r\nreligious freedom?\r\n\r\nOne could be forgiven for having

  communities,\r\nthey are also seen as responsible for their preservation and\r\nperpetuation.
  According to one American study, the parents of young\r\nmigrant women saw their
  daughters as more responsible than their sons\r\nfor the positive representation
  and perpetuation of their culture and\r\nconsequently legitimately subject to parental
  control when it came to\r\nwhat they wore, their participation in extracurricular
  and social\r\nactivities, their future choices about education and employment and
  even\r\ntheir decisions about when and who to marry. While some girls openly or\r\ncovertly
  flouted such restrictions, others submitted, despite what they\r\nadmitted were
  high psychic, social and/or material costs. Philosopher\r\nSusan Okin tells a story
  of an Indian student facing a forced marriage\r\nthat would preclude her graduation
  from high school. While the 17-year\r\nold admitted that her parentsâ\x80\x99 decision
  had â\x80\x9Cmessed upâ\x80\x9D her dreams and\r\nplans, leaving her â\x80\x9Ctormentedâ\x80\x9D,
  she bristled at her teacherâ\x80\x99s suggestion\r\nthat she might resist. â\x80\x9CIn
  our religion, we have to think of our parents\r\nfirstâ\x80¦I will do it the Muslim
  wayâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nFor Okin, arguably the 20th centuryâ\x80\x99s most eminent
  female philosopher,\r\none solution to the clash between feminism and multiculturalism
  is to\r\nensure female members of religious sub-groups have what she calls\r\nâ\x80\x9Crealistic
  rights of exitâ\x80\x9D. Liberal pluralist societies like Australia\r\nshould only
  tolerate the rights of minority groups to discriminate\r\nagainst women when those
  women are truly free to respond to such\r\ndiscrimination - and the more limited
  life aspirations and achievements\r\nthey entail - to leave the group, and build
  an alterative life\r\nelsewhere. Small-l liberal states that do not guarantee this
  freedom to\r\nall their citizens are guilty of failing to protect womenâ\x80\x99s
  moral right\r\nto choice and control over their lives.\r\n\r\nBut the right to escape
  a community that is oppressive is not enough.\r\nGender-discriminatory cultures
  and religions have a profound impact on\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99s beliefs about their legitimate
  entitlements in this life. If\r\ngirls grow up hearing, as they do if they attend
  some private\r\nfundamentalist Christian schools, that their failure to accept a\r\nsubordinate
  and obedient role in the home leaves the â\x80\x9Cdoors open to\r\nSatanâ\x80\x9D,
  their opportunities to exit are significantly undermined. This\r\nis because, to
  rephrase the Rocky Horror Showâ\x80\x99s Dr. Frank-N-Furter, if\r\nyou canâ\x80\x99t
  see it, you canâ\x80\x99t be it. As a consequence, asserts Okin, where\r\nmulticultural
  practices eviscerate the self-esteem necessary for girls\r\nand women to develop
  their own values and plans, the State is well\r\nwithin its bounds to outlaw them.
  This is particularly the case because\r\nthe alternative - that oppressed women
  can either â\x80\x9Clump it or leaveâ\x80\x9D -\r\nnot only deprives women of the
  opportunity to participate in and enjoy\r\nthe positive aspects of their cultures,
  it more or less ensures the\r\nentrenchment in such cultures of gender-oppressive
  attitudes and\r\nbehaviour. After all, if the women who object to them have no other\r\noption
  but to leave, itâ\x80\x99s hard to see from where the force for change\r\nwill come.\r\n\r\nAn
  emphasis not just on the obligation of liberal states to equip girls\r\nand women
  from minority cultures to exit, but to ensure the conditions\r\nexist for them to
  stay, is likely to draw fierce resistance from some\r\nminority cultural and religious
  groups. The leaders of such groups may\r\nbrand as culturally imperialist claims
  that particular practices (like\r\ndistinctive and highly restrictive female dress
  and education\r\nemphasising traditional gender roles and sexual morality) are oppressive\r\nto
  women, and insist that â\x80\x9Ctheirâ\x80\x9D women freely choose to engage in
  them.\r\nWhere practices less open to interpretation are at issue - like female\r\ngenital
  mutilation, or forced child marriages - they may argue that\r\ncultural expression
  and survival must take priority over gender\r\nequality.\r\n\r\nPhilosopher Ayelet
  Shachar has observed that â\x80\x9Ca disproportionate share\r\nof the costs of multiculturalismâ\x80\x9D
  is born by the most vulnerable groups\r\nin the community: children, women and homosexuals.
  Shacharâ\x80\x99s point,\r\nobvious but often overlooked, is that minority cultural
  and religious\r\ngroups are not homogeneous, but comprise less and more powerful
  members.\r\nThis is something to keep in mind when the most powerful members insist\r\non
  majority toleration of a practice that results in the least powerful\r\ncopping
  it sweet.\r\n\r\nA focus on exit rights, and the conditions necessary to stay, is
  not\r\nreally as radical as it may sound. When we insist that that the\r\nperpetrators
  of domestic violence, not the victims, leave the family\r\nhome, or applaud court
  decisions that prohibit religious schools from\r\nfiring married women because of
  their view that they belong at home, we\r\nendorse an Okin-esque view that a truly
  just society doesnâ\x80\x99t just\r\nsupport its citizens to escape injustice by
  leaving, but helps them to\r\nfight it, so they can stay.\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s these
  battlers, after all, who make the world a more just place for\r\nus all."
