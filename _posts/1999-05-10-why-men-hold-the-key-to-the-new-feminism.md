    of the hallmarks of the feminism of Generation X is a more peaceable\r\nattitude
    towards men. This is good, because if women are to enter the\r\nnext stage of
    the revolution, weâ\x80\x99re going to need them.\r\n\r\nNot that we know it.
    When women discuss the work and childbearing\r\nproblem, they do speak of men.
    They note approvingly what a good father\r\ntheir partner will be, and how supportive
    he is of her desire to work.\r\nBut when it comes to resolving the conflict between
    work and parenting,\r\nmen exit stage left from womenâ\x80\x99s musings. Few expect
    men to contribute\r\nhalf of the effort necessary to get them back to work after
    the birth,\r\nand none see the child-care problem as a shared one.\r\n\r\nWomenâ\x80\x99s
    definition of the work and parenting conflict is how she is\r\ngoing to take responsibility
    for her decision to work after she has a\r\nbaby (since it is she who is \\`\\`shirkingâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99
    what society sees as her\r\nfull-time mothering obligation). Women do not see
    the problem as how\r\nthey, a couple in which both partners work, are to face
    the challenge to\r\ntheir existing work patterns posed by the birth of their child.\r\n\r\nSex-role
    socialisation is not the only reason women tend to assume all\r\nthe responsibility
    for planning and raising baby. They are also\r\nrealists. While studies continue
    to report improvements over the past 10\r\nyears in menâ\x80\x99s assumption of
    child care and housework, they still do\r\nless of both than women, even if both
    are working full-time.\r\n\r\nMen also make more money than women and, if a child
    is to be cared for\r\nat home, it usually makes more sense for the low-earner
    to give up work.\r\nChild care is appallingly expensive. Only women with well-paid
    jobs make\r\nenough to cover the costs for just one child and still have anything\r\nleft
    over, let alone two or three.\r\n\r\nAt a barbecue last month I met a woman slowly
    going insane from\r\nproviding full-time care to a demanding toddler and a four-year-old.
    She\r\nyearned to return to the part-time secretarial position she had before\r\nthe
    last child was born. But with the cost of work clothes, travel and\r\nchild care,
    she and her husband had concluded it just was not worth it.\r\n\\`\\`I just have
    to wait until theyâ\x80\x99re at school,â\x80\x98â\x80\x99 she said, \\`\\`then
    it\r\nwill be my turn.â\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\n\r\nGovernment support, in the form
    of subsidised child care and\r\nanti-discrimination legislation, will go some
    way to making it\r\neconomically rational for women to decide to return to a job
    they still\r\nhave after they give birth. But only workplace reform will deliver
    to\r\nwomen the level playing field that will ensure their job is as\r\nworthwhile
    as it was before they became a mother.\r\n\r\nWhile business lauds itself for
    providing actual part-time work and set\r\nthe 40-hour working week, few women
    really want such \\`\\`mummy-trackâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99\r\npositions. Being on the
    mummy-track means getting less interesting work\r\nthat, even if done well and
    in a timely manner, is less valued by\r\ncolleagues and superiors. It also means
    copping the resentment of\r\ncolleagues when arriving after 9am and racing out
    the door at 5pm.\r\n\\`\\`Itâ\x80\x99s all right for some,â\x80\x99â\x80\x99 many
    sneer, forgetting that the reduced\r\nhours mothers work means reduced take-home
    pay.\r\n\r\nOthers on the part-time mummy-track, still laden with a full-time\r\nworkload,
    return their status to full-time so at least they get paid for\r\nthe work they
    do.\r\n\r\nMothers donâ\x80\x99t want special treatment at work, and they shouldnâ\x80\x99t
    need\r\nit. What they need, like all other Australian workers, is better work\r\nconditions.
    All workers, not just parents, have a life and\r\nresponsibilities outside work,
    and all would appreciate and benefit from\r\nleaving work every night at a reasonable
    hour.\r\n\r\nOnce all workers leave early and together, working mothers benefit.\r\nFirstly,
    because itâ\x80\x99s not only mothers going home to spend the evening\r\nwith
    the kids, but fathers, too. For working women, this means two\r\npeople, instead
    of one, to share child collection, shopping and other\r\ndomestic tasks. Secondly,
    when hiring and firing and promotion time\r\ncomes around, the end of the mummy
    track means working mothers are no\r\nlonger disadvantaged in comparison to working
    fathers, the childless or\r\nparents with older children. In fact, a \\`\\`reasonable
    hours for allâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\npolicy may assist women now parenting full-time
    to use their husbands\r\nreasonable home arrival time to support well-earned personal
    time, or to\r\npursue paid work.\r\n\r\nAnd this is where men come in. Because
    without an en masse challenge by\r\nworking fathers and fathers-to-be to the corporate
    culture that is (or\r\nwill be) depriving them of active fatherhood, Australian
    workplaces have\r\nlittle reason to change. While trickles of downshifters abandoning
    the\r\nrat-race validate our belief that workplace culture is unbalancing our\r\nlives,
    high unemployment means employers can replace the drop-outs with\r\nfresh-faced
    recruits, and never question the structural nature of what\r\nwent wrong.\r\n\r\nMen
    hold the vast majority of powerful positions in corporate Australia,\r\nand it
    is for them that current corporate culture is seen - and was\r\ndesigned - to
    cater. By joining together, perhaps in one of the newly\r\nforming unions for
    high-income earners, working fathers and\r\nfathers-to-be could be at the vanguard
    of the next revolution - a\r\nrevolution for the benefit of themselves, working
    mothers, and every\r\nworker who has things they want to and must do after work."
