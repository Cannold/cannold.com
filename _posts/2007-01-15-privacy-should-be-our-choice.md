  content: "Privacy, as Victorian Privacy Commissioner Paul Chadwick recently\r\nobserved,
    is a freedom most noticed in its absence. Sadly, we only seem\r\nto appreciate
    what we had once itâ\x80\x99s gone.\r\n\r\nPhilosophers, having long accepted
    the inadequacy of words to explain\r\nthe importance of privacy, often illustrate
    it with 18th century thinker\r\nJeremy Benthamâ\x80\x99s panopticon.\r\n\r\nThe
    panopticon is a circular building divided into cells constructed\r\naround a central
    tower. While occupants are isolated from one another by\r\nwalls, they can be
    viewed by an unseen observer.\r\n\r\nA prison? Absolutely, but more than this
    the building was designed to\r\nobtain â\x80\x9Cpower of mind over mind by creating
    aâ\x80\x9Dsentiment of an invisible\r\nomniscience\", or what you and I might
    describe as the unnerving\r\nuncertainty that someone could be watching you.\r\n\r\nThe
    value of privacy is only grasped when we recognize that even if the\r\nsurveyors
    do nothing with the information they gather about cell\r\noccupants - neither
    recording nor relaying it - it is their power to\r\nobserve us if and when they
    choose that causes harm.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government announced last April its
    intention to pursue what\r\nis in all but name a national identity card. The scheme
    has the capacity\r\nto compromise our privacy in relationship to government, and
    the\r\nmega-corporations (among them Unisys, Visa and IBM) expected to vie for\r\nthe
    lucrative privilege of providing the technology to merge, match and\r\nshare our
    personal information across the public and private sectors.\r\n\r\nCurrent proposals
    suggest my card will contain my unique identifying\r\nnumber and name on the front,
    as well as my signature and biometric\r\nphoto. The smart chip will contain -
    among other things - my address, my\r\ndate of birth and details of my children
    and other dependants. These\r\ndetails are mandatory, must reside in the â\x80\x9Cpublicâ\x80\x9D
    zone of the card, and\r\nare protected by a PIN so insecure that the Australian
    Privacy\r\nFoundation has condemned the cardâ\x80\x99s technological design as
    â\x80\x9Ccompletely\r\ninadequateâ\x80\x9D. In other words, according to the parts
    of the legislation\r\nthe government has made public, anyone with a card reader
    will be able\r\nto see the private details stored on my cardâ\x80\x99s chip.\r\n\r\nThis
    includes hundreds of thousands of government employees, health and\r\nallied professions
    and childcare workers. Last year Centrelink revealed\r\nit had to sack, sanction
    or turn over to the police or government\r\nprosecutors 2% of their staff for
    breaches of â\x80\x9Ccustomerâ\x80\x9D privacy.\r\n\r\nSome people object to identity
    cards on principle. They, like Liberal\r\nparty official Tim Warner, believe that
    by forcing us to prove our\r\nidentity to obtain government services, ID cards
    invert the master\r\nservant relationship of citizen and government. Governments
    only confirm\r\nsuch fears when they contend that those with nothing to hide have\r\nnothing
    to fear.\r\n\r\nI agree with such principles, but my objection to the card is
    more\r\npractical.\r\n\r\nI advocate for reproductive rights. Each year I spend
    time and money\r\nprotecting my phone number (itâ\x80\x99s silent), my address
    (not on the\r\nelectoral rolls), and the names, ages and other identifying details
    of\r\nmy children. I do this because a handful of my opponents are violent, as\r\nthe
    murder of a security guard at the East Melbourne Fertility Clinic in\r\n2001 proved.
    As far as possible, I try to protect my family from the\r\nnegative repercussions
    of my activism.\r\n\r\nMinister for Human Services Joe Hockey says that when it
    comes to the\r\ncard, Australians have choice. We donâ\x80\x99t have to have the
    card at all. As\r\nwell, he says that the card mandates the same information found
    on a\r\ndriverâ\x80\x99s license. If the system is cracked - something he has
    repeatedly\r\nrefused to guarantee wonâ\x80\x99t happen - citizens lose no more
    than they do\r\nwhen their wallets go missing.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is disingenuous
    to say that participation in the new identity\r\ncard system is voluntary. No
    card means no Medicare rebates, PBS\r\nmedicines, Centrelink payments, Veteranâ\x80\x99s
    pensions, disability benefits,\r\ncarersâ\x80\x99 payments, baby bonus, AusStudy,
    unemployment benefits or related\r\nconcessions on public transport and utility
    bills. Unless we are\r\nindependently wealthy, we will need to sign up.\r\n\r\nThe
    wallet story also mischaracterizes reality. I lose mine with\r\nabsent-minded-professorial
    regularity and usually, someone nice returns\r\nit to me intact.\r\n\r\nWhen they
    donâ\x80\x99t, or its been deliberately nabbed, the loss of my silent\r\nnumber
    or information about my children has never been a concern. This\r\nis not only
    because, like most people, I donâ\x80\x99t keep this information in\r\nmy wallet,
    but because even if I did, it would be unlikely to be of\r\ninterest to an opportunistic
    thief: something that canâ\x80\x99t be said about\r\nthe high-tech robbers expected
    to attempt to break in to the honeypot of\r\nidentity card data.\r\n\r\nLike much
    that is lost, neither the privacy of my silent number or\r\naddress can be found
    again. Like a victim of domestic violence, at\r\nsimilar risk to having their
    safety jeopardized by exposure of their\r\naddress details, getting a new number
    and shifting house are the only\r\nway to regain my security. At least itâ\x80\x99s
    something. The privacy of my\r\nchildrenâ\x80\x99s details is gone forever.\r\n\r\nAll
    of us are at risk of such irrecoverable loss of our private\r\nidentifying details
    and - because the database will hold our biometric\r\ndata and copies of our proof
    of identity documents like passports and\r\nbirth certificates - identity theft.
    No matter how state of the art the\r\nsecurity designed to protect it, the very
    nature of the IT wars - the\r\nbattle for supremacy between security geeks and
    crackers - means\r\nsecurity risks to the system will be perpetual and very real.
    Steal my\r\ncredit card, I cancel it and get another. But what next when a\r\ncyber-crim
    knocks off the biometric parameters of my face?\r\n\r\nCurrent proposals for an
    Australian identity card put my security and\r\nthat of my family at risk. However,
    one should not need to demonstrate\r\nsuch a threat to claim the right to enjoy
    the benefits of privacy. The\r\nbalance is all wrong. The question isnâ\x80\x99t
    whether citizens have something\r\nto hide. The question is whether the government
    is entitled to demand,\r\nrecord, sift, sort, match and share our private information
    and\r\nbiometric identifiers without making a solid case for why this is\r\nnecessary,
    how it will work, and why less invasive approaches wonâ\x80\x99t do.\r\n\r\nThe
    kick-off date for card issuing is April or May 2008. Time is fast\r\nrunning out
    for Australians to say â\x80\x9Cnoâ\x80\x9D."
