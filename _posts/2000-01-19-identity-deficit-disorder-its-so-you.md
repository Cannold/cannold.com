  content: "JENNY McCARTNEYâ\x80\x99S hand-wringing about the preoccupation of the
    modern\r\nWestern woman with vanity and consumption (on this page, 6/1) has a\r\nfamiliar
    ring to it. I am 34 now, and for as long as I can remember,\r\nresponsible society
    has been exhorting me and my fellow female\r\ntravellers to consider what we might
    have time to think about were we\r\nspending less time thinking about the shapes
    of our bodies.\r\n\r\nWhile the description of the problem is accurate, the diagnosis
    is way\r\noff.\r\n\r\nIt is a shame that women invest too much time, emotional
    energy and\r\nmoney in their appearance. But the problem is not caused, as McCartney\r\nand
    others suggest, by the failings either of individual women or women\r\nas a gender.\r\n\r\nFor
    one thing, men are fast becoming as invested in their appearance as\r\nare women.
    The repetitive advice offered by menâ\x80\x99s magazines about how to\r\nget an
    abdominal \\`\\`six packâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 and slim down makes this clear, as
    does\r\nmenâ\x80\x99s fast-growing participation in plastic surgery. (They make
    up\r\nbetween 20 and 30 per cent of cosmetic surgery patients.) This is not a\r\ngender
    problem, but one belonging to all members of modern Western\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\nThe
    philosopher Margaret Somerville describes such societies as\r\nmulticultural,
    pluralist, individualistic, secular, post-modern and\r\npost-materialist. What
    she means is that Australians (and Americans,\r\nCanadians and Britons) are no
    longer bound by a collective culture, a\r\ncommon religion or a shared modernist
    belief in the capacity of reason\r\nand science to fuel inexorable progress towards
    greater knowledge and\r\nsocial and moral improvement.\r\n\r\nWe also are no longer
    primarily occupied, as were all humans before us,\r\nwith the business of survival.
    What all these \\`\\`postsâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 mean, says\r\nSomerville, is that
    while we know who we were and what we used to\r\nbelieve in, we donâ\x80\x99t
    know who we are and what we believe in now. This\r\nleaves us with a bit of time
    on our hands and a historically\r\nunprecedented lack of identity and sense of
    purpose to guide our use of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe same existential nasties still plague
    us - who are we and what is\r\nthe purpose and meaning of our lives? - but there
    are fewer givens and\r\nminimal guidance to help us choose from an ever-expanding
    array of\r\nbelief and identity choices. Should we become a Buddhist, or a Wicca\r\nWitch?
    Volunteer our time to save the environment or build a CV in\r\npursuit of a career?\r\n\r\nWhile
    existentialists such as Jean-Paul Sartre urge us to revel in our\r\nfreedom to
    define the essence of ourselves and our lives, some\r\nexperience such vast freedoms
    and the accompanying panoply of choices as\r\ndistinctly unliberating. Confused
    and without the navigational compass\r\nprovided by a core sense of self and purpose,
    we are vulnerable to the\r\nentreaties of any passing group or ideology that claims
    to have the\r\nanswers.\r\n\r\nIn capitalist countries, the most extensively promoted
    and widely\r\navailable answer is consumerism. A certain car promises jump-in-the-air\r\nexuberance
    and certain margarines claim to deliver mothers much\r\nsought-after affirmation
    and appreciation of their sacrifices.\r\nParticular perfumes or clothing labels
    pledge to make us feel ourselves\r\nto be a certain kind of person (dignified,
    chic, worth it).\r\n\r\nThe products we are told to buy change like the weather.
    The message\r\nthat we must buy something to be something remains the same.\r\n\r\nIt
    was inevitable that the pressure to define ourselves by where we put\r\nour bodies,
    and what we put them in, would give way to pressure to alter\r\nthem. Striving
    for a particular shape at the gym keeps us busy, gives us\r\na certain self-defining
    look and helps us achieve the work success\r\nand/or spunky partner that contributes
    to a socially valued identity.\r\n\r\nPlastic surgery can take us where the gym
    cannot, as well as delay the\r\ninevitable identity crisis facing those who have
    put most of their\r\nidentity eggs in the young and pretty/handsome/fit basket.
    Of course,\r\ntying our identity up with our looks is not always a matter of choice.\r\nMany
    men having face-lifts say a more youthful appearance is essential\r\nto keeping
    or succeeding at their job.\r\n\r\nBut it doesnâ\x80\x99t have to be this way.
    Pollster Daniel Yankelovich says\r\nAmericans yearn to break free of the boundaries
    and limits of material\r\npossessions, career and money and find some form of
    transcendence. Simon\r\nLongstaff, of the Sydney-based St James Ethics Centre,
    says the same is\r\ntrue for Australians. Generation X employees in particular
    seek\r\nmeaningful work in companies in which they can feel proud.\r\n\r\nThe
    ultimately unsatisfying nature of the answers that consumerism gives\r\nto our
    existential queries also provides a window of opportunity into\r\nwhich more worthy
    and substantive solutions to our post-modernist\r\ndilemmas can be levered.\r\n\r\nBut
    the first step to embracing such opportunities is to stop viewing\r\nconsumerist
    self-obsession as the peculiar moral failings of individual\r\nwomen or a peculiar
    genetic failure unique to those with two\r\nXchromosomes.\r\n\r\nVanity is merely
    the symptom of identity deficit disorder, an ailment of\r\nour particular time
    and place that affects us all. To remedy it, we will\r\nneed historically situated
    and socially based solutions."
