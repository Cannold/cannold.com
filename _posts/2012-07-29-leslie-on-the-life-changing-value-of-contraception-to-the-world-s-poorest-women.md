  content: "THIS past Thursday, I \"live tweeted\" highlights from London's Family
    Planning Summit, a joint enterprise of the Gates Foundation and the British government.\r\n\r\nThe
    best of the summit was rolled out for a Sydney conference room crowded with men
    and women whose tireless advocacy for family planning services in the developing
    world led to what all agree is a pivotal moment in international development.\r\n\r\nThat
    moment was sparked by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation pledge of $550 million
    to increase contraceptive access in the developing world. The investment will
    prevent 100 million unintended pregnancies, and 200 million maternal deaths from
    unsafe abortion and unsafe motherhood. Among those saved will be girls aged 15
    to 19, for whom pregnancy is the biggest killer.\r\n\r\nAll of this is consistent
    with the mantra that women's rights are human rights. Help a man, and he benefits.
    Aid a woman, and she will lift her children, her family and her community out
    of poverty. But only if she has access to birth control.\r\n\r\nThe story of Judith,
    a mother from Papua New Guinea, is typical. With three healthy children at school,
    Judith works a vegie patch - and her husband fishes - to support the family. In
    contrast, Judith's neighbour suffers ill health from having 10 children close
    together, preventing her from working outside the home, and putting school fees
    out of reach.\r\n\r\nThe key difference between the two women is that Judith was
    only 25 when a mobile family planning clinic came to town and fitted her with
    an IUD - an intervention that came too late for her neighbour.\r\n\r\nThe influence
    of feminist ideals on the Gates Foundation is undeniable. Ditto for the governments
    and NGOs that, by the summit's end, had brought the tally of what is claimed to
    be new financial commitments to international family planning efforts to a whopping
    $2030 million.\r\n\r\nBrochures distributed at the breakfast waxed lyrical about
    female empowerment, female education and female earning power. Gates defends her
    dissent from the Vatican's stance on modern contraception by affirming that women's
    lives matter: ''I believe in not letting women die â\x80¦ we need to give a voice
    to women all over the planet. This will be my life's work.''\r\n\r\nGreat stuff,
    though it did make some of the tweets in response to my comments so odd. ''What
    about the millions of girls that will be killed instead through abortion?'' complained
    one follower. Offered another: ''But not if you continue to support the silent
    elimination of girls through abortion.''\r\n\r\nFirst, it's important to realise
    that the Gates initiative is focused on preventing pregnancy through contraception,
    not ending it by abortion. Of course abortion comes up in discussions of family
    planning - mainly because reducing the rate of unplanned pregnancies is the most
    effective way to reduce the incidence of abortion - but surely those opposed to
    abortion can't object to fewer of them?\r\n\r\nPerhaps my tweeters have been infected
    by long-standing misinformation from the church about how modern and effective
    forms of contraception work. For years, some have wrongly claimed that the so-called
    ''morning-after pill'' prevents pregnancy by causing very early abortions. In
    fact, emergency contraception blocks fertilisation and so has nothing to do with
    abortion. We now know this is also true for daily oral contraception - which the
    church also opposes.\r\n\r\nBut even if the Gates initiative were about providing
    safe abortion, the ''loss of future'' women argument would fail. The World Health
    Organisation says that even if couples contracepted perfectly 100 per cent of
    the time, coerced sex and imperfect contraceptive technology mean there would
    still be 6 million accidental pregnancies every year.\r\n\r\nThe tweeters seem
    to be saying that a feminist response to that reality is to force couples to continue
    an unwanted pregnancy to protect the rights of an embryo that has only a 50 per
    cent chance - should it survive to birth - of being female.\r\n\r\nIn contrast,
    they see no gender equity issue arising with the state stripping half its actual
    female population of basic human rights to medical privacy and bodily autonomy,
    as well as the ability to fulfil maternal responsibilities to existing children,
    around half of whom are known to be female.\r\nThe influence of conservative traditions
    and religions remains a key impediment to women's empowerment and their very survival.\r\n\r\nBut
    the Gates initiative is a game changer. In 1994 in Cairo, the whole world agreed
    that family planning was a human right.\r\nNow, money where mouth is, the lives
    of the poorest women and girls around the globe may finally be set to change."
