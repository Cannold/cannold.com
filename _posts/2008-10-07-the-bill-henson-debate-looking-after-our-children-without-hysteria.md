    he has attended since kinder, and the first day of work for the\r\nprincipal.
    Oh, and the day he had to fight through a media scrum to get\r\nthrough the front
    gate.\r\n\r\nYes, my child attends [that school]() the one embroiled in the most\r\nrecent
    installment of the Henson saga. At the time of the â\x80\x9Cincidentâ\x80\x9D\r\nchronicled
    in an extract of David Marrâ\x80\x99s forthcoming book, both my kids\r\nwere there.\r\n\r\nSo
    as the moral panic that has surrounded this case since it first hit\r\nthe headlines
    cranks into gear again, I want to set the record straight.\r\nI am not â\x80\x9Crevolted
    and horrifiedâ\x80\x9D (the PM), â\x80\x9Coutragedâ\x80\x9D (Malcolm\r\nTurnball)
    nor feeling â\x80\x9Cbetrayedâ\x80\x9D (Bill Heffernan) that former principal\r\nof
    my childâ\x80\x99s school escorted the godparent of a student at the\r\nschool-internationally
    renowned artist Bill Henson-through the\r\nplayground so he could see whether
    any of the children might be\r\nappropriate models.\r\n\r\nNor am I horrified,
    outraged, revolted or feeling betrayed that after\r\nHenson identified one girl
    and one boy, that the principal-not\r\nHenson-contacted the childrenâ\x80\x99s
    parents, gave them the artistâ\x80\x99s number\r\nand then bowed out: leaving
    the decision about making contact with the\r\nparents. The girlâ\x80\x99s parents
    never made the call, the boyâ\x80\x99s-believing the\r\nexperience would be good
    for his confidence-went ahead.\r\n\r\nHereâ\x80\x99s what does concern me: the
    boy in the eye of this new storm. I\r\nunderstand he felt proud of his selection
    as an artistâ\x80\x99s model, and was\r\npleased with the photos. In the wake
    of reporters staking out the school\r\nand confused classmates asking questions,
    how might he be feeling now?\r\nHow ironic that those fueling the current hysteria
    claim to be concerned\r\nabout the childâ\x80\x99s best interests when only the
    profoundly deluded would\r\nclaim that the feeding frenzy that now threatens to
    devour this young\r\nboy serves to protect him.\r\n\r\nThe truth looks more like
    this. That adults with no awareness of the\r\nusual practice of schools when dealing
    with sporting and artistic\r\nscouts, no knowledge of the particular needs of
    this young boy, no\r\ninsight into the factors the parents considered when deciding
    to involve\r\ntheir son and no concept of the social milieu in which those parents\r\nwere
    operating (St Kilda has more artists than any other place in\r\nVictoria) have
    been invited by the media to pass judgment on decisions\r\nmade by those well
    across these things.\r\n\r\nIf our former principal had taken George Lucas through
    the playground,\r\nand as a result the next child star of Star Wars 87 was born,
    would\r\nanyone be caterwauling now?\r\n\r\nI suspect not, and the reason why
    is clear. It is that, despite the fact\r\nthat police declined to press charges
    against Henson after forensically\r\nexamining the photos they dragged from the
    walls of the Roslyn Oxley9\r\ngallery in May-photos that the Classification Board
    subsequently rated\r\nPG-Henson is still considered guilty as not charged: a pornographer,
    not\r\nan artist.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that our children are vulnerable to
    abuse, but in\r\nnearly every case the perpetrator wonâ\x80\x99t be a stranger
    but someone close\r\nto them: a relative or family friend, their scout-master
    or parish\r\npriest. As far as I am aware, no child has ever been harmed by the\r\ngodfather
    of a classmate looking at him while the principal of his\r\nschool stood nearby.
    This suggests that while pillorying this particular\r\nartist, even banning him
    and all his kind from our schools for evermore\r\nmay make us feel we are â\x80\x9Cdoing
    something,â\x80\x9D it will not make our kids\r\nsafer.\r\n\r\nSo what can we
    do? The answer is to go for the real targets, not the\r\neasy ones. \\\r\nAccording
    to the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse\r\nand Neglect,
    keeping our children safe requires us to know where they\r\nare, to encourage
    them to trust their feelings and to share them with\r\nus, and to teach them that
    their bodies belong to them alone.\r\n\r\nChildren these days live cosmopolitan
    lives. The tools they use to learn\r\nabout and interact with the wider world-instant
    and text messaging,\r\nsocial networking sites and what a colleague of mine calls
    â\x80\x9Cthe\r\ngoogleâ\x80\x9D-are Greek to many of us. But while this makes
