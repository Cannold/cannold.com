    oneâ\x80\x99s\r\nvote for a man who strongly believes in whatâ\x80\x99s awful,
    or for a woman who\r\nbelieves in nothing except getting herself elected?\r\n\r\nThe
    conundrum exposes the two central items on our wishlist for\r\npolitical leaders:
    that they stand for something, and for something we\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nLiberal Opposition
    Leader Tony Abbottâ\x80\x99s strength is his believability.\r\nHaving observed
    him for years as a high profile Howard government\r\nminister, we trust that he
    is as he appears: a conservative Catholic man\r\nguided in his political judgement
    by Vatican dictates on personal moral\r\nissues like abortion, stem-cell research
    and euthanasia, and by small\r\ngovernment neo-liberal orthodoxy on much else.\r\n\r\nThe
    consistent visibility of Abbottâ\x80\x99s beliefs reassures us. It promises\r\ncertainty
    with regard to the direction he would take the country. This\r\nis not just because
    such values direct some choices while prohibiting\r\nothers but because, having
    held fast to these values for so long, we\r\nfeel he wonâ\x80\x99t relinquish
    them easily. When challenged by economic hard\r\ntimes, boisterous community groups
    or international recalcitrance, we\r\nsee Tony Abbott as someone who will fight
    for his beliefs, not cut and\r\nrun.\r\n\r\nBut Abbottâ\x80\x99s strength is also
    his weakness. This is for the simple\r\nreason that his strongly held moral values
    are an anathema to most of\r\nus. For instance, reputable polls show that around
    80 per cent of\r\nAustralians support legal abortion, stem cell research and voluntary\r\neuthanasia.
    So, too, do we know that the economic agenda of the big\r\nbusiness leaders who
    have his ear will leave most of us - and the public\r\ninstitutions and infrastructure
    on which we rely - worse off.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Ministerâ\x80\x99s problem is different.
    As personable as Abbott -\r\nwhen in â\x80\x9Creal Juliaâ\x80\x9D mode, anyway
    - she remains a lesser-known quantity.\r\nWhere she has distinguished herself,
    or been noted by others, it is most\r\noften for matters of form, not substance.
    She seems smart and\r\narticulate, yet we have little sense of what direction
    sheâ\x80\x99ll steer the\r\ncountry because we donâ\x80\x99t know the things that
    really matter to her -\r\nwhat sheâ\x80\x99ll fight for and never compromise on,
    no matter what.\r\n\r\nGillard rarely discusses the things she believes in. Because
    of this, we\r\ntend to assume. We assume that because she has a working class\r\nbackground
    and made education the centrepiece of her parliamentary\r\nmaiden speech that
    she favours a first class public education system.\r\nHaving bravely asserted
    her lack of faith in God, we assume she will\r\ndefend the barrier between church
    and state. Because she is Australiaâ\x80\x99s\r\nfirst female PM, we think sheâ\x80\x99ll
    stand and fight for the policies women\r\nneed to succeed.\r\n\r\nBut we are often
    proved wrong. In her short time in the top job Gillard\r\nhas refused to alter
    the way government funds state and private schools\r\nand has expanded the school
    Christian chaplaincy program by a third. She\r\nopposes gay marriage and was the
    strongest opponent in Ruddâ\x80\x99s kitchen\r\ncabinet of the miserly paid parental
    leave scheme Australian feminists\r\nbattled for decades to achieve.\r\n\r\nTo
    make matters more confusing, when Gillard moves against what we\r\nthought sheâ\x80\x99d
    defend, she tends to laud her stance as proof of her\r\nmetal. The MySchools website
    is a textbook case, though what she expects\r\nus to draw from it is anyoneâ\x80\x99s
    guess. Does she view her willingness to\r\nscrew an expected adversary - in this
    case, the education union - as\r\nproof of a practical even-handedness that she
    sees as the essence of her\r\ncharacter? Or is this dispassionate judicial-like
    persona, concerned\r\nwith formal process rather than substance, all she is willing
    to share\r\nwith us, preferring to keep private the aspects of her character that\r\nwould
    reveal her policy preferences and her heart.\r\n\r\nWhatever is the case, the
    real problem is that Laborâ\x80\x99s tactics have\r\nundermined any claim to evidence-based
    policy at every turn. Whether\r\nitâ\x80\x99s setting aside the Henry Tax Review
    to placate West Australian\r\nminers, or pre-empting its own assessment of the
    National School\r\nChaplaincy Program to expand it by a third or proposing a citizens\r\nassembly
    to address the science of climate change, Labor has done little\r\nmore than hand
    out taxpayer funds to marginal electorates or interest\r\ngroups that scream the
    loudest throughout the campaign. And since week\r\nthree, when Gillard shook of
    the shackles of Laborâ\x80\x99s election\r\nstrategists, she has been in charge
    and doing it her way.\r\n\r\nHaving said this, Abbott also seems determined to
    undermine his own\r\nstrengths on the character front. Avoiding press forums that
    might see\r\nhim go off message, he looks at times to be visibly straining on
    his\r\nlead. While his pounding of the â\x80\x9Cno means noâ\x80\x9D mantra in
    response to\r\nGillardâ\x80\x99s request for a debate was widely lauded as a blunder,
    I suspect\r\nit did him good. It affirmed that, despite the muzzling, he remains
    the\r\nsame man: oblivious to a feminist anti-rape slogan familiar to many\r\n12-year-olds,
    and one sincere in his illogical assertion that men with\r\ndaughters canâ\x80\x99t
    be sexist.\r\n\r\nThere is something dispiriting about watching people we call
    leaders try\r\nto suppress their souls, or pretend they never had one in the first\r\nplace.
    This is particularly the case when there seems no reason to have\r\ngone to such
    lengths. As respected social researcher Hugh Mackay has\r\nexplained, campaigns
    have little impact on the election results. History\r\nshows that polls taken
    just before campaigns begin usually point to the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThis appears
    to be confirmed by the latest Neilson poll, which has Labor\r\nahead 53 to 47
    on a two party preferred basis, figures almost identical\r\nto the 52 to 48 split
    the same poll recorded a week before the election\r\nwas called."
