    in a rare moment of bi-partisanship, the Federal\r\nGovernment and Opposition
    joined forces to reject Speaker Harry\r\nJenkinsâ\x80\x99s call for a debate on
    whether the Lordâ\x80\x99s Prayer should continue\r\nto be said at the start of
    each parliamentary day.\r\n\r\n> Thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as
    it is in heaven\r\n\r\nWe all know it. Hell, Iâ\x80\x99m Jewish and can recite
    it backwards. Anyone\r\nraised in a Christian-dominated culture like the US or
    Australia could.\r\nWhile opponents of a debate on the prayer claim this makes
    it\r\nâ\x80\x9Cuniversal,â\x80\x9D unless they mean â\x80\x9Cecumenical,â\x80\x9D
    they are mistaken. While\r\nseveral billion Catholics, Protestants and Eastern
    Orthodox Christians\r\ncome together at Easter to chant the prayer, it is doubtful
    that\r\nfollowers of any of the other worldâ\x80\x99s religions join in. Not to
    mention\r\nthe silence of the growing army of atheists.\r\n\r\n> Give us this
    day our daily bread. Forgive us our trespasses as we\r\n> forgive those who trespass
    against us\r\n\r\nIts defenders tell us that the Lordâ\x80\x99s Prayer has begun
    Parliament since\r\n1901. As part of our history and tradition, it must continue
    to do so.\r\nâ\x80\x9COur nation was founded on faith in the Bible and on prayer,â\x80\x9D
    said a\r\nletter-writer to The Canberra Times. â\x80\x9CItâ\x80\x99s appropriate
    that we open\r\nparliaments with the Lordâ\x80\x99s Prayer for its cultural and
    historic\r\nrelevance,â\x80\x9D agreed the Australian Christian Lobbyâ\x80\x99s
    Jim Wallace.\r\n\r\nRitual and tradition express our most profound beliefs and
    values. They\r\nrisk irrelevance, even ridicule, if they fail to change with the
    times.\r\nIn 1901 neither Aborigines nor the majority of Australian women had
    the\r\nright to vote or to stand for a seat in the new commonwealth parliament.\r\nIf
    parliament began each day with an ode to the political supremacy of\r\nwhite men,
    would anyone cite â\x80\x9Ctraditionâ\x80\x9D as a good reason to preserve\r\nit?
    Opponents of a debate about the Lordâ\x80\x99s Prayer must explain why its\r\ncontinued
    recitation is in line with the values and aspirations of\r\ncontemporary Australia,
    not those of yesteryear.\r\n\r\n> Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from
    evil.\r\n\r\nDonâ\x80\x99t believe in sin? Have little truck with evil? Opponents
    of a debate\r\nhave the answer for you: just say silent when the prayer is read.
    They\r\nsay that surely with the world economy turning molten, there are far\r\nmore
    important matters to discussion.\r\n\r\nAh, deflection and trivialisation-the
    last argumentative refuge of\r\nscoundrels. It reminds me of how men used to guillotine
    feminists by\r\naccusing them of lacking a sense of humour.\r\n\r\nThose objecting
    to the Lordâ\x80\x99s Prayer do so on principle. The principle\r\nis that in a
    multi-ethnic and multi-religious society like Australia,\r\nchurch and state should
    be separate.\r\n\r\nChristians defend their right to question and even refuse
    to follow laws\r\nthat conflict with their principles. In response, they are rarely
    told\r\nto take a deep breath and get over themselves. This may be because we\r\ntend
    to assume that those motivated to act from their Christian faith\r\nare moral
    agents who, agree with them or not, deserve to be taken\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\nWell,
    I say that non-Christians also have consciences that drive them to\r\nstand up
    for what they believe. They too deserve a hearing and to have\r\ntheir moral concerns
    treated with respect.\r\n\r\nIf Christian concerns were enough to spark a Senate
    inquiry into\r\nMedicare funding of abortions necessary to save a womanâ\x80\x99s
    life, surely\r\nnon-Christian ones should be enough to allow discussion of the
    ongoing\r\nrelevance of the Lordâ\x80\x99s Prayer.\r\n\r\n> Amen."
