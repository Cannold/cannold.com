    in a shaky marriage. The couple\r\nseparated, but then reconciled. When Patti
    discovered she was pregnant,\r\nboth knew the child could be that of the lover
    she took during their\r\ntime apart. Patti agreed to put Garyâ\x80\x99s name on
    the birth certificate,\r\nand Gary pledged to love and raise the child - Gary
    Jr - as his own. But\r\nwhen the marriage ended, Patti asked the court to deny
    Gary further\r\naccess to the boy on the grounds that he was not the childâ\x80\x99s
    biological\r\nfather. Gary fought back, seeking to maintain contact and both rights\r\nand
    obligations to the child. Ultimately, however, the court held that\r\nas â\x80\x9Cthird
    partiesâ\x80\x9D neither he - nor his parents - had any entitlement to\r\na relationship
    with the small child.\r\n\r\nThe second man, Liam, was married for four years.
    After separating from\r\nhis wife he sporadically paid child support for his three
    children.\r\nSeveral years later Liam took a paternity test that showed his eldest\r\nchild
    was the only one biologically related to him, enabling much of his\r\ndebt for
    unpaid child support for all three children - none of whom\r\nspeak to him any
    longer - to be cancelled. Still not content, Liam\r\nlaunches a suit against his
    ex-wife for damages caused by her â\x80\x9Cdeceitâ\x80\x9D,\r\nincluding financial
    losses related â\x80\x9Cto the time he had spent with, and\r\nmoney he had spent
    on, the children under the mistaken belief that he\r\nwas their father.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nMy
    response to these stories includes feelings of pity and of admiration\r\nfor Gary,
    and of moral revulsion for Liam (not to mention Patti). Yet\r\nwhile Gary languishes
    in obscurity, Liam has become the poster-child for\r\nparts of the Fatherâ\x80\x99s
    Rights Movement: the man who story is intended to\r\nalchemise our pity and moral
    outrage into table-thumping demands for\r\nsystemic change to the family law system.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    if the mediaâ\x80\x99s coverage of the two cases is anything to go by,\r\nI may
    be alone in moral assessment of both menâ\x80\x99s actions. While Garyâ\x80\x99s\r\ncase
    has been virtually ignored by the, every step of Liamâ\x80\x99s journey\r\nthrough
    the courts has been catalogued by a panoply of mostly male\r\njournalists whose
    indignant hearts appear to beat as one with his.\r\nRegularly referred to as a
    â\x80\x9Ccuckoldâ\x80\x9D, and the children he has parented\r\nfrom birth as those
    â\x80\x9Cfatheredâ\x80\x9D by â\x80\x9Chis wifeâ\x80\x99s loverâ\x80\x9D, such
    hacks appear\r\nunable to resist photographing Liam in tragic poses: head bowed
    and hand\r\nslapped across face, or looking wistfully into the distance at what\r\nmight
    have been.\r\n\r\nWhat might have been? An alternative - and morally balanced
    universe -\r\nwould have told a different story about Gary and Liam. Garyâ\x80\x99s
    story\r\nmight have provided growing evidence of menâ\x80\x99s recognition of
    the\r\ncritical role they do and should play in the lives of children; not as\r\nsperm
    donors or walking wallets, but committed hands-on parents. The\r\nrallying of
    Fatherâ\x80\x99s Rights Groups behind Gary would have reinforced the\r\nmessage
    from such groups that fathers matter in the lives of children,\r\nand that the
    role of law and policy is to assist married men to actively\r\nparent their children
    and to maintain their relationship with them in\r\nthe unhappy event of relationship
    breakdown.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the media and Fatherâ\x80\x99s Rights Activists
    in this alternative\r\nuniverse would largely ignore Liamâ\x80\x99s case. Such
    groups, strengthened by\r\nthe inclusion in their ranks of adoptive fathers and
    men parenting\r\nchildren born from donor insemination, would be appalled by the
    cost of\r\nLiamâ\x80\x99s legal manoeuvrings to the children who call him â\x80\x9Cdadâ\x80\x9D.
    Joining\r\nwith the Child Support Agency to urge that parents in such situations
    to\r\nâ\x80\x9Cthink about the impacts on their childrenâ\x80\x9D, both groups
    would judge\r\nLiam harshly for elevating his desire for retributive justice against\r\nhis
    ex-wife above the viability of his paternal relationship with his\r\nchildren.
    To avoid such cases in the future, they would call for\r\nAustralian law to consistently
    define fatherhood in social, rather than\r\nbiological, terms.\r\n\r\nThe closest
    thing to love is hate, and marriage can be a dirty game.\r\nInfidelity in relationships
    where faithfulness is expected or agreed to\r\nis wrong, no matter who does the
    deed (though statistics remind us that\r\nmen - not women - are most often the
    culprits)) But how much tarring and\r\nfeathering should innocent dependants be
    asked to wear to assuage the\r\npride or deepen the hip pocket of either party?\r\n\r\nIn
    my alternative moral universe every person dignified with the title\r\nâ\x80\x9Cadultâ\x80\x9D
    would know when enough is enough."
