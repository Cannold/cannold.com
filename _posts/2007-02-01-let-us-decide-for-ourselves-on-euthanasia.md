  content: "The hypocrisy of the Coalition government on issues of personal choice\r\nis
    breathtaking. While supporters of restrictions on junk food\r\nadvertising to
    children or universal minimum workplace conditions are\r\nâ\x80\x9Cnanny stateâ\x80\x9D
    advocates, blanket prohibitions on the capacity of\r\nterminally ill Australians
    to control the time and manner of their own\r\ndeaths are claimed to show adequate
    respect for individual choice.\r\n\r\nInternational and Australian surveys repeatedly
    show strong public\r\nsupport for euthanasia. A 2002 Morgan survey found 70% in
    favour of laws\r\nallowing hopelessly ill patients to seek assistance from doctors
    to\r\nsuicide. Seventy-five per cent of sitting members in the last Victorian\r\nparliament
    supported the rights of the terminally ill to die with\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\nSuch
    figures may explain why opponents of a right-to-die rarely mention\r\nthe religious
    and ideological principles behind their stand and focus\r\ninstead on pragmatic
    objections to legal change. These include claims\r\nthat patient-controlled death
    will undercut efforts to improve\r\npalliative care, that proper pain management
    always alleviates\r\nsuffering, and that only what Juliette Hughes (Opinion 30/1)
    calls â\x80\x9Cthe\r\ndesperate, lonely, depressed and in painâ\x80\x9D (ie those
    lacking autonomy)\r\nchoose death over palliation.\r\n\r\nOregon, Belgium, the
    Netherlands and Switzerland allow medicos to\r\nrespond to patient requests for
    active assistance to die. Empirical\r\nevidence from these jurisdictions does
    not support claims that the\r\nlegalisation of assisted suicide for the terminally
    ill undercuts the\r\nquality of palliative care. This makes sense, as only around
    2% of\r\nterminally ill patients make use of their legal right to assisted\r\nsuicide.
    The remainder continue to choose palliative care.\r\n\r\nA phenomenal 77% of Australians
    disbelieve the repeated insistence of\r\nright to die opponents that modern palliative
    care sufficiently\r\naddresses the suffering of the terminally ill. The decision
    of John\r\nElliot - a medical doctor - to suicide in Zurich last Thursday suggests\r\nhe
    didnâ\x80\x99t believe it either. Or, alternatively, that he understood that\r\nsuffering
    is not limited to physical pain but includes the loss of oneâ\x80\x99s\r\nwits,
    privacy with regard to bodily functions and the capacity to\r\npresent oneself
    to others - including oneâ\x80\x99s spouse and children - as one\r\nwould like
    to be seen. Anticipation of uncontrolled pain as well as the\r\nloss of such personal
    dignity appears a major motivator of Elliotâ\x80\x99s\r\ndecision to die: â\x80\x9CMy
    disease has dictated thatâ\x80¦I will die in pain. Worse\r\nthan this, though,
    I will have no dignity in death. I donâ\x80\x99t want my wife\r\nAngelika to see
    me in this wayâ\x80¦. I want to exit this worldâ\x80¦with my head\r\nheld high.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nAt
    the heart of the right-to-die case are claims about the entitlement\r\nof citizens
    to autonomously choose to live what they define as a good\r\nlife, and die what
    they see as a good death. But Liberal democratic\r\nsocieties have no obligation
    to honour the wishes of the incompetent or\r\nthe coerced. This is why those opposed
    to the legal right to die use\r\nlanguage - â\x80\x9Cknocked offâ\x80\x9D or â\x80\x9Cput
    to deathâ\x80\x9D - that assumes what must be\r\nproved: that those other than
    the terminally ill will dictate the ifs\r\nand whens of an assisted suicide.\r\n\r\nCircular
    definitions help â\x80\x9Cproveâ\x80\x9D their case. For right-to-die\r\nopponents,
    only the depressed choose death over palliation, and\r\ndepressed patients canâ\x80\x99t
    make autonomous choices. Similarly, it is\r\nclaimed that patients who are loved
    and adequately cared for will not\r\nchoose to die, rendering all who do make
    this choice necessary victims\r\nof coercion by penny-pinching medical administrators
    or avaricious\r\nrelatives.\r\n\r\nDr Elliot was wealthy, educated, not depressed,
    and consistent about his\r\ndesire to die. But his life was not perfect. His wife
    was open about the\r\nburdensome nature of his care. In his recitation of his
    reasons for\r\nchoosing death Elliot includes the fact that he had burdened her
    for\r\nâ\x80\x9Ctoo long alreadyâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nDo decisions to die that reference
    the needs or influence of important\r\nothers, or society at large, lack the independence
    necessary for us to\r\nheed them? Those opposed to individual choice in personal
    moral matters\r\nsay â\x80\x9Cyesâ\x80\x9D. Abortion opponents argue that an â\x80\x9Cabortion
    cultureâ\x80\x9D pushes\r\nwomen to undertake â\x80\x9Cunwantedâ\x80\x9D abortions.
    Men who fail to offer women the\r\nfinancial or emotional support they want to
    continue the pregnancy\r\nâ\x80\x9Ccoerceâ\x80\x9D women into abortion in the
    same way as inadequately sacrificing\r\nrelatives compel the terminally ill to
    â\x80\x9Cchooseâ\x80\x9D death.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that if choices were only
    available to those with perfect\r\nlives, few of us would quality. It is one thing
    to point out that social\r\nconditions may constrain the freedom of individuals
    to choose by\r\ndepriving them of the full range of options, or the capacity to
    choose\r\nbetween them. Itâ\x80\x99s another to say that less than ideal choice
    is no\r\nchoice at all. As well, arguments that the addition of\r\nphysician-assisted
    suicide to the range of options available to the\r\nterminally ill somehow reduces
    their freedom to choose make no sense at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nWeâ\x80\x99ve been here
    before. Thirty years ago radical feminists insisted that\r\na pro-natalist culture
    and coercion from â\x80\x9Ctechno-docsâ\x80\x9D made the choices\r\nof infertile
    women to undertake IVF unworthy of the name. These\r\nfeminists claimed that the
    incapacity of â\x80\x9Cvulnerableâ\x80\x9D infertile women to\r\nchoose, plus
    the damage they claimed the technology posed to women as a\r\ngroup, justified
    banning it.\r\n\r\nResentful of being patronised, many infertile women returned
    fire.\r\n\r\nChoices made in an imperfect world are still worthy of respect, they\r\ninsisted.
    By all means, fix the world to expand our options further. But\r\nin the meantime,
    leave us with the freedom to decide between the options\r\nthat are available,
    according to our needs and values."
