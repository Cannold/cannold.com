    of\r\njustice?*\r\n\r\nIn recent years, courtesy of the Culture Wars, complaints
    about the\r\nabsence of Jesus, or Christianity more generally, from the gusto-filled\r\nway
    Australians celebrate Christmas have crowded our newspapers and\r\nclogged the
    airways. This year, In contrast, has been quieter. A pointed\r\nindicator, perhaps,
    of the emphatic eviction of John Howard from the\r\nLodge, and the promise made
    by the new tenant of a kindler, gentler\r\napproach to the demands of multi-cultural
    and multi-religious Australia.\r\n\r\nSo what better time for a secular Jew to
    talk about Jesus? To draw a\r\nclear line under the terrible decade of narrow-mindedness,
    intolerance\r\nand absolutism of the past decade by recalling who the historical
    figure\r\nof Jesus of Nazareth was and what he sought to achieve. And, in so\r\ndoing,
    clear a space at everyoneâ\x80\x99s holiday celebrations - religious,\r\nsecular
    or otherwise - to commemorate this justice-seeking defender of\r\nthe dispossessed.\r\n\r\nA
    potted history of the life and time of Jesus would include the fact\r\nthat he
    was an outsider. Illegitimate and poor in a culture where a\r\nmanâ\x80\x99s standing
    and status among his fellows was entirely dependent on\r\nhis relationship with
    God. But the privilege of being seen in the eyes\r\nof God as an Israelite, a
    member of the chosen people, was not available\r\nto everyone. Certain people
    were ruled out on the basis of\r\ncharacteristics they neither controlled nor
    could change - gender for\r\ninstance - while others, the sick and those involved
    in unclean\r\noccupations like fishing or tanning, required purification to earn
    Godâ\x80\x99s\r\nforgiveness, and so be welcomed back into the community of upright\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nBut
    the cost of forgiveness was high, and controlled by the Priestly\r\ncaste of Jews
    who ran the Temple in Jerusalem. Not only did all Jews at\r\nthat time pay a tithe
    to the Temple, they were also required to fork out\r\nfor individual rituals -
    incense- burning, the offering of loaves and\r\nthe sacrifice of animals - ordered
    to alleviate sin and guilt. But while\r\nthe Priests and their families were the
    sole beneficiaries of the\r\nresulting largess, the penitent had no guarantees
    his offering would\r\nachieve the desired ends. In fact, the failure of a sacrifice
    to cure an\r\ninfirmity might make matters worse, confirming Godâ\x80\x99s continued
    judgement\r\nof the sick person as beyond redemption.\r\n\r\nThat the Temple was
    corrupt was a widely held view at the time. Jesusâ\x80\x99s\r\ncontribution was
    to imply that it was also unjust. As he criss-crossed\r\nthe Galilee offering
    forgiveness and healing to the unclean - those\r\nliterally cast outside the gates
    of their villages and towns to cleanse\r\nspiritual pollution - his implicit claim
    was clear. A relationship with\r\nGod, and access to the Kingdom of Heaven, was
    open to all. That this\r\nincluded women and others deemed inherently â\x80\x9Cuncleanâ\x80\x9D
    is evidenced not\r\njust by his many female disciples and benefactors, but by
    Jesusâ\x80\x99s\r\nexplicit rejection of notions of immutable male supremacy to
    which many\r\nof his followers were attached. When, in the Gospel of Thomas, Simon\r\nPeter
    calls for Jesus to dismiss Mary as disciple because she is â\x80\x9Cnot\r\nworthy
    of life,â\x80\x9D Jesus replies that he will â\x80\x9Cguide her to make her\r\nmaleâ\x80¦for
    every female who makes herself male will enter heavenâ\x80\x99s\r\nkingdomâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nWhile
    clearly lacking a contemporary feminist sensibility, such remarks\r\nwere radical
    for the time, entertaining the possibility that those the\r\nprivileged and powerful
    deemed less than fully human (deservedly\r\nmarginalised and dispossessed, in
    other words) were capable of being\r\nseen by God and of reaping all the social
    status and privileges this\r\nentailed.\r\n\r\nSo who among our moral leaders
    is most like Jesus of Nazareth? Is it\r\nPresident of Liberty Victoriaâ\x80\x99s
    Julian Burnside QC who battles for the\r\nrights of the poor to legal representation
    and for formal justice for\r\ntwo of the most reviled groups in western societies:
    prisoners in\r\nGuantanamo Bay and asylum seekers? Or Cardinal George Pell, who
    leads\r\nthe fight against the ordination of women and in a recent book of essays\r\naccused
    Catholics who allowed their consciences to shape their values -\r\n, rather than
    dictates from the Church hierarchy - of â\x80\x9CDonald Duck\r\nheresyâ\x80\x9D?
    Is Dr Jo Wainer, a woman who has dedicated much of her life to\r\nfighting for
    legal and social recognition of womenâ\x80\x99s full humanity, a\r\ntrue disciple
    of Jesus? Or it is Danny Nalliah, President of Catch the\r\nFire Ministries and
    one-time Family First candidate, who asks his\r\nparishioners to pray that God
    will â\x80\x9Cpull downâ\x80\x9D what he calls [Satanâ\x80\x99s\r\nstrongholds]()
    brothels, gambling places, bottle shops, mosques and\r\nFreemasons, Buddhist,
    Hindu and other Temples?\r\n\r\nKnowledge of the history of Jesus the man makes
    the answers clear.\r\n\r\nJesus of Nazareth was a spiritual activist and political
    radical who\r\nmade enormous personal sacrifices to bring his vision of a more\r\ncompassionate,
    inclusive and just world to fruition. It is those who\r\nbehave as Christians
    - a sometimes different group to those claiming to\r\nbe them - who keep Jesusâ\x80\x99s
    radical, truth-seeking, cage-rattling, spirit\r\nalive\r\n\r\nSo, as we head off
    to the beach this summer for a well-earned rest, let\r\nus remember to honour
    our modern day Jesus of Nazarereths: the men and\r\nwomen who find inequity offensive,
    and fight for justice for the most\r\nbenighted in our community, often at great
    personal, professional and\r\nfinancial costs. And let us find time to consider
    how, when 2008 rolls\r\naround, we might engage in a bit of radical, truth-seeking
    cage-rattling\r\nof our own. The sort of cage-rattling designed to make a real
    difference\r\nfor one of the oppressed, marginalised, forgotten or dispossessed
    groups\r\nin the Australian community who quietly thirst for justice.\r\n\r\nThe
    sort of cage-rattling that might just turn 2008 into a year to make\r\nJesus proud."
