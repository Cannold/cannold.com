    to have their last wishes carried out, and their bodies treated\r\nwith respect.\r\n\r\nBut
    as the baby-boomers approach old age, this is set to change. Soon,\r\ndeaths will
    outnumber births in this country. When they do, we shall\r\ncome face-to-face
    with our least favourite topic-what to do with our\r\nbodies when we die.\r\n\r\nCurrent
    trends are unsustainable. City cemeteries are chockers, forcing\r\nthe 30 per
    cent of us still choosing burial to be interred out of town,\r\nor to lease a
    space for thirt-odd years closer to home that may be on\r\ntop of an ossuary full
    of older bones. Those choosing cremation will\r\nhardly fare better, with the
    scarcity of memorial sites and the price of\r\nleasing them also on the rise.\r\n\r\nThen
    thereâ\x80\x99s the environmental costs. Cremation costs us, and the earth,\r\nless.
    A 2007 report by consulting firm GHB found that while cremation\r\nemitted four
    times as much CO2 on the day as burial, factoring in the\r\ncost of maintaining
    cemeteries saw cremation triumph as the superior\r\nenvironmental option.\r\n\r\nNot
    that either option is anything to write home to mother about. The\r\naverage car
    produces 4.5 tons of carbon every year, making the emissions\r\nload of each burial
    the equivalent of 38 cars, and that of cremation\r\nonly slightly less.\r\n\r\nNatural
    earth burials cost the same as cremation, but are far easier on\r\nthe earth.
    The untreated body is wrapped in shroud or unlined pine box\r\nand buried with
    a microchip or magnet. Relatives wanting to return to\r\nthe site put its coordinates
    into a GPS device provided by those\r\nmanaging the site.\r\n\r\nThe idea, to
    quote ABC journalist Ian Townshend, is to turn your body\r\ninto â\x80\x9Cfood
    for [a] treeâ\x80\x9D in what will eventually become a forest of\r\nsouls: a natural
    memorial ground developed by the gradual re-vegetation\r\nof suitable space. Itâ\x80\x99s
    an idea thatâ\x80\x99s time may have come. In the UK,\r\nwhere natural burial
    has been an option for a decade, 35 per cent want\r\nto approach perpetuity this
    way.\r\n\r\nThe founder of White Knight Funerals, one of the few operators offering\r\nnatural
    earth burials, puts the moral case for choosing them baldly.\r\nâ\x80\x9CBoth
    cremation and traditional burial areâ\x80¦environmentally\r\nirresponsible. It
    is one thing to consume to support human life, butâ\x80¦to\r\ntreat our dead in
    such a way that they continue to consume post mortem\r\nis absurd.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIn
    other words, we are selfish to choose traditional burial or cremation\r\nwhen
    a better choice exists, and our families are morally irresponsible\r\nto let us.\r\n\r\nI
    like the idea of natural burials, but am not quite convinced. Yes,\r\nlarge headstones
    may be over the top, but an unmarked grave seems\r\nextreme in the other direction,
    denying the departed and those who\r\ngrieve for her the individualization that
    dignifies and recognises loss.\r\nAnd what of the history and comfort provided
    by traditional cemeteries?\r\nI spent many angst-ridden years walking through
    the one near my\r\nuniversity, gaining perspective through the reading of the
    trials of\r\nothers as revealed by their headstones (wives lost to childbirth,\r\nchildren
    to disease, whole townships to famine). What will be lost from\r\nour history
    if memorialisation of the dead becomes impermanent? Memorial\r\nkiosks are the
    proposed solution, but what happens when it all-both\r\ntrees and kiosk-go up
    in smoke courtesy of a passing bushfire?\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s something to think
    about for sure, but natural burial has some way\r\nto go."
