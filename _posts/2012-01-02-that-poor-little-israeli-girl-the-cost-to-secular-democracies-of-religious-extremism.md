  content: "Last week in Israel, a news story shocked the nation. It concerned Naama
    Margolis, an Orthodox Jewish girl, who was shown crying and quaking at the prospect
    of taking the 800-metre walk from her home to school. \r\n\r\nThe reason for her
    distress? The harassment and intimidation she has been subjected to by a roving
    band of ultra-Orthodox men who felt that her long-sleeved shirt and below-knee-length
    skirt were insufficiently \"modest\".The men called Naama a slut. They spat on
    her and made her fear for her safety. \r\n\r\nNaama Margolis is eight years old.\r\n\r\nThe
    story has gone global. But so far few of the male \"experts\" who have been asked
    to comment appear to have a clue what is truly at stake, not just for women or
    Israel, but for all pluralist secular democracies.\r\n\r\nWhat Naama's story reveals
    is the unavoidable clash between the sexist edicts of religious extremists and
    the state's guarantee of full human rights to all its female citizens.\r\nBehind
    this clash is a far older and more fundamental one. Namely, who will decide how
    women will live - the church or the state?\r\n\r\nWhatever god or gods they believe
    in, adherents of orthodox religious sects share the view that they - or their
    undemocratically appointed male leaders - have exclusive access to the wishes
    of the one true God.\r\n\r\nThis absolutist and arrogant view makes them wholly
    intolerant of fellow citizens of no faith, other faiths and even - as was the
    case with Naama - those of their own faith whose beliefs or practices differ from
    their own.\r\n\r\nTo ultra-orthodox adherents of every religious tradition - Christian,
    Hindu, Muslim, Jewish - the rest of us are not fellow humans whose beliefs are
    entitled to the same respect and licence they demand for their own. At best, we
    are ignorant dolts worthy of pity. At worst, we are sinners deserving damnation
    or death.\r\n\r\nMuslim author Salman Rushdie, well-known atheist Christopher
    Hitchens and former US president Jimmy Carter have been among those who have noted
    the persistent relationship between religious extremism and the often violent
    oppression of women. Of the Islamic republic of Pakistan, Hitchens wrote: \"Here
    is a society where rape is not a crime. It is a punishment. Women can be sentenced
    to be raped â\x80¦ if even a rumour of their immodesty brings shame on their menfolk.''\r\n\r\nCarter,
    who left the Southern Baptist Church several years ago over its treatment of women,
    said the ''view that the Almighty considers women to be inferior to men is not
    restricted to one religion or tradition â\x80¦ The truth is that male religious
    leaders have had - and still have - an option to interpret holy teachings either
    to exalt or subjugate women â\x80¦'' He added: ''They have, for their own selfish
    ends, overwhelmingly chosen the latter.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to see the men
    who run the world's religions do an about-face on the gender issue. But forgive
    me if I don't hold my breath. More disappointing is the refusal of leading liberal
    men - opinion makers, legislators and adjudicators - to prosecute gender justice
    with anywhere near the enthusiasm they dedicate to attacking racial inequality.\r\n\r\nIn
    Israel, it would be unthinkable for black Jews (known as \"Falasha\") to be forced
    to the back of public buses to appease the sincerely held views of ultra-Orthodox
    men that this is where they belong. Yet, this is precisely what is happening to
    women. In fact, Israeli legislators have had to pass a special law to overrule
    Israel's standing requirements for gender equality to ensure the demands of ultra-Orthodox
    men for segregated buses could be accommodated.\r\n\r\nThe Americans are no different.
    In 1983, a US court vindicated the tax office's refusal to give exempt status
    to Bob Jones University because the Christian college's admission policy was -
    on what the college deemed the advice of God - racially discriminatory. In contrast,
    American courts continue to stand by while scripture is cited as justification
    for the church's refusal to hire women for senior pastoral roles or pay them the
    same rates as men.\r\n\r\nAustralian lawmakers are just as supine, something that
    might surprise those who remember the claim by then treasurer Peter Costello that
    gender equality was what distinguished Australia from societies governed by sharia
    law. But Australia's Sex Discrimination Act offers extensive exemptions to religious
    bodies that wish to discriminate against women for no other reason than that they
    are women - the very definition of unjust bias.\r\n\r\nWhether it is in the training,
    educating and appointing of senior ministers or \"any other act or practice,\"
    male church leaders can do as they please when it comes to women, if that's what
    they claim God demands. Sexism is unjust and unfair. It is as debilitating to
    the life chances and self-esteem of women - and to the societies that sacrifice
    the talents of its citizens on the altar of bigotry - as racism.\r\n\r\nSecular
    authorities have been tussling with religious rulers over who makes the rules
    for a long, long time. To prevail, democratically elected rulers must understand
    and enforce the limits of a tolerant society. Indeed, in my view, Australia needs
    a far more militant democracy - one linked to core values such as secularity and
    equality and buttressed by pre-emptive constitutional protections against such
    foundational values, or democracy itself, risks being overridden or given away.\r\n\r\nThese
    values should apply to all democracies, Israel included. Naama, like all females,
    whether they be little girls or women, deserves to live in a society that defends
    her freedom and her opportunities, and insists she be judged on the content of
    her character.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this she is going to need political leaders who
    don't just talk about gender equality to score political points, but in the face
    of religious bigotry and intimidation, have the balls to defend it.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
