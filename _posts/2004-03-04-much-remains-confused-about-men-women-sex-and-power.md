    right\r\nto raise her grievances publicly and have them addressed in a legitimate\r\nforum,
    but I worry that others might not. The men being named are\r\nsporting heroes,
    and it wasnâ\x80\x99t all that long ago that author Helen\r\nGarner questioned
    the legitimacy of young women bringing charges of\r\nsexual assault, both because
    of serious damage the resulting publicity\r\nhad on the manâ\x80\x99s reputation,
    and because she felt it was the job of\r\nyoung women to take responsibility for
    the effect their sexuality had on\r\nthe opposite sex.\r\n\r\nFor those feeling
    cynical about the sudden onslaught of allegations, it\r\nis critical to understand
    that â\x80\x9Cdate-rapeâ\x80\x9D charges come in waves for\r\ngood reason. Unless
    they have been violated by a bush-leaping,\r\nbalaclava-clad stranger, women tend
    to doubt themselves when it comes to\r\nlabelling a disturbing, violative or even
    abusive sexual encounter as\r\nassault. Was it really rape, they wonder, if I
    flirted with the guy\r\nearlier than evening, was drinking, had a short skirt
    on, consented to\r\nall forms of petting short of intercourse?\r\n\r\nEven if
    they are savvy enough to know that no one - no matter what she\r\nsaid, wore or
    did - asks to be raped, they may worry others will\r\ndisbelieve their story,
    or claim that they did. This is where other\r\nwomen speaking out is critical.

    keeping silent gain the courage\r\nto speak, too.\r\n\r\nThe media, police, and
    the clubs deserve credit, in other words (with\r\nthe exception of St Kilda, who
    having spoken only to the two accused\r\nhave now publicly declared themselves
    100% behind their â\x80\x9Cboysâ\x80\x9D) for\r\nresponding appropriately to the
    womenâ\x80\x99s charges, and therefore\r\nencouraging other women to emerge from
    the shadows.\r\n\r\nBut the avalanche of accusations has another cause too, one
    which I\r\nthink testifies to the success of feminism, and bodes well for gender\r\nrelations
    in the future. Many of the women making charges against\r\nplayers are from Generation
    X and even Y - young women in their twenties\r\nand thirties - who see as their
    birthright to either receive respect\r\nfrom the opposite sex, or to demand it.
    These confident, assertive women\r\nhave come of age with the knowledge that no
    man has the right to use\r\neither his advantage in strength or power to disadvantage
    her; either in\r\nthe bedroom or the office. When men do abuse either, they see
    little\r\nproblem in bringing them to account.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to see how such
    forthright attitudes from young women, if\r\nwidespread and sustained enough,
    will not fundamentally alter the\r\nbehaviour of young men. After all, the whole
    reason gender relations are\r\nso fraught is that men and women want and need
    each other: they want and\r\nneed each other in bed, to build the long-term intimate
    relationships so\r\nfundamental to their emotional well-being, and to form and
    raise\r\nfamilies. This means that when one gender change the rules, the other
    -\r\nno matter how much they moan and complain - has little choice but to\r\nadjust
    their ways. If women wonâ\x80\x99t sleep with or marry men until they are\r\ntreated
    with respect on all relevant turfs, in other words, then men\r\nwill start seeing
    their role in the attainment of equality for women as\r\na bread and butter issue.\r\n\r\nRenegotiated
    power relations between the sexes are to be welcomed, to a\r\npoint. While Australians

    they were during the 1990s - needing a signed\r\nconsent form before they could
    safely have sex with a woman - we do want\r\nall sexual engagements to be conducted
    with an awareness not only of the\r\nexciting and unpredictable frisson of Eros,
    but of the potential that\r\nunequal power and intoxication has for causing misunderstanding,
    and the\r\nimportance of mutual respect, open communication and excellent listening\r\nskills.\r\n\r\nWhen
