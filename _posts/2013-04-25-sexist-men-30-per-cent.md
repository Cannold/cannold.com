    first female Prime Minister, first female police chief, first popularly elected
    female mayor of Sydney and one of the central contentions of contemporary feminism
    itself suggests that on the gender relations front, he wasnâ\x80\x99t feeling
    relaxed and comfortable at all.\r\n\r\nThe source of his discomfort is 30%.\r\n\r\nFeminist
    aspirations for women to participate equally in society were for 50%. They believed
    a fair and equitable society would offer opportunities to all its citizens regardless
    of gender and, because women were just as capable as men, equal opportunities
    would result in equal participation.\r\n\r\nWeâ\x80\x99re not there yet. While
    Australian womenâ\x80\x99s educational attainment is among the best in the world,
    the 2011 Global Gender Gap Report from the World Economic Forum shows that we
    fell six points to 18th for economic participation and six points to 38th for
    political empowerment.\r\n\r\nAmong the many things weâ\x80\x99ve learned from
    womenâ\x80\x99s slow progress is that there are critical waypoints along the road
    to equality. One of these waypoints is 30%. That is the point of critical minority
    and therefore critical change. When 30% of any workforce or team is female, women
    become visible: they are seen by their own daughters and girls in general as an
    example of whatâ\x80\x99s possible; they can influence how a work environment
    operates rather than needing to act like a bloke to fit in; they can sponsor other
    women into positions of influence and by so doing bring about lasting change.\r\n\r\nNone
    of this is to say that 30% represents equal participation for women. It does not.
    Nor is it to say that women must settle for 30% because in a world still run by
    men, this is the best they can realistically hope for. Rather, it is to suggest
    that 30% can serve as an effective staging post from which equality-minded citizens
    can consolidate and gather forces for the final assault on the male citadel and
    a true and total sharing of power.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CAdd to this Jonesâ\x80\x99
    threat of violence against the few women who have managed to fight their way past
    the old guard and get their just desserts â\x80¦ and the ingredients were there
    for a riot.â\x80\x9D\r\nThere are ample studies to show the ways in which 30%
    constitutes a critical mass but for me the proof of the pudding has always been
    in the way the most terrible s-xists start squawking whenever the 30% mark in
    their field of endeavour is approached or reached. Iâ\x80\x99m not saying theyâ\x80\x99re
    doing the numbers, but rather that itâ\x80\x99s an intuitive thing. To s-xist
    males, 30% is the point at which they start to feel uncomfortable because when
    they look around, the joint is no longer being solely run by and for them.\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99m
    a writer, so I first noticed it here. When male writers start claimingâ\x80\x89â\x80\x94â\x80\x89as
    did Gerard Windsor in 1986â\x80\x89â\x80\x94â\x80\x89that â\x80\x9Cwomen writers
    get favoured status treatment â\x80¦ the worst position for a writer to be in
    is that of being a middle-aged, Anglo-Celtic maleâ\x80\x9D, I did some counting
    and discovered that women were by no means dominating among published authors
    but from humble beginnings had crept past the 30% mark.\r\n\r\nWhile I hesitate
    to call Jones a journalist, he does operate in the media world and the media is
    largely focused on happenings in the world of politics. A 2012 paper on female
    representation in Australian parliaments found 30% of all parliamentarians in
    Australia are female. This figure breaks down to reveal that 31% of Australiaâ\x80\x99s
    federal politicians of female and 25% of those in the NSW Parliament are women.
    A 2009 paper found that 23% Australian policeâ\x80\x89â\x80\x94â\x80\x89but only
    8% of senior commissioned officersâ\x80\x89â\x80\x94â\x80\x89are women.\r\n\r\nMoving
    on to the media world, Chrys Stevenson demonstrated in a 2012 The Kingâ\x80\x99s
    Tribune article on gender equity in Australiaâ\x80\x99s fourth estate, women are
    at the 30% mark in most of the counts that matter. Percentage of female front-page
    bylinesâ\x80\x89â\x80\x94â\x80\x8930%; percentage of stories about women or in
    which the main talent is femaleâ\x80\x89â\x80\x94â\x80\x8930%. Subjects of, or
    female talent for, the storyâ\x80\x89â\x80\x94â\x80\x8930%. Percentage of women
    featured in front-page photos and cartoonsâ\x80\x89â\x80\x94â\x80\x89including
    Melbourne Cup hat and other glam shotsâ\x80\x89â\x80\x94â\x80\x8936%.\r\n\r\nTo
    Jones, the sudden visibility of women rubbing shoulders with the powerful, expectingâ\x80\x89â\x80\x94â\x80\x89perhaps
    even feeling entitled toâ\x80\x89â\x80\x94â\x80\x89the same opportunities for
    advancement as he has always enjoyed is the sight of the barbarians at the gate.
    When men like him and Windsor gripe about being overrun by women, they are not
    making precise numerical claims about female dominance in their field of endeavour.
    Rather they are calling upon the language of fairness and justice to express their
    view that however much women have in a numerical sense, they have too much in
    a moral one. Moreâ\x80\x89â\x80\x94â\x80\x89to be preciseâ\x80\x89â\x80\x94â\x80\x89than
    men like Jones feel they deserve.\r\n\r\nTo the feminist barbarians who clashed
    with Jones over the â\x80\x9Cdestroy the jointâ\x80\x9D comments, everything about
    what Jones said and what he represents rankled. The 30% aspiration for female
    participation distressed because everyone knows that true equality requires women
    to get half, while the struggle women face to achieve this reduced goal was plain
    depressing. Add to this Jonesâ\x80\x99 threat of violence against the few women
