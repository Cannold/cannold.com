  content: "by Anne Mannne, Allen & Unwin, 2005.\r\n\r\nMotherhood is the latest in
    a long line of cri de coeur books by\r\nbaby-boom women about what is claimed
    to be the incompatibility of\r\nâ\x80\x9Cfeministâ\x80\x9D ideas about motherhood
    and female emancipation and their\r\nlived experience of motherhood. Like Manne,
    such authors breathed\r\nfeminist assumptions - about the equality of menâ\x80\x99s
    and womenâ\x80\x99s talents,\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99s need for economic independence
    and human flourishing - â\x80\x9Cas\r\nnaturally as airâ\x80\x9D. But when their
    children are born, such women find\r\nthey conflict with the way they want to
    mother (or as Manne prefers, the\r\nway children need them to mother).\r\n\r\nAt
    the heart of Motherhoodâ\x80\x99s claim to know what children really need and\r\nwhat
    therefore, according to the logic of such texts, mothers are\r\nmorally compelled
    to provide is Manneâ\x80\x99s preternatural insight into the\r\nemotional life
    of pre-verbal children: her own and other womenâ\x80\x99s.\r\nMotherhood is replete
    with anecdotes about the mothers that breezily\r\nassert the acceptability of
    their care arrangements when Manne - having\r\nsized the situation up in less
    than a minute - knows better. â\x80\x9COne\r\nfriendâ\x80\x9D, she reveals, â\x80\x9Cput
    her baby into full-time care when the baby\r\nwas nine months old. Meeting me
    in the street, she anxiously assured me\r\nthat the baby was \\`quite happyâ\x80\x99
    in care. But the baby told a different\r\nstory. When the caregiverâ\x80\x99s
    name was mentioned, she put her arms around\r\nher motherâ\x80\x99s neck, and
    with look of indescribable sadness, laid her head\r\ndown on her motherâ\x80\x99s
    shoulder.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nManne offers â\x80\x9Cmaternal feminismâ\x80\x9D as
    a cutting-edge framework for\r\nresolving these issues rather than a theoretical
    relic of the 1980s\r\nimpossibly encumbered by the same problems of regressive
    essentialism\r\nthat plague Motherhood. Indeed, the bookâ\x80\x99s key take-home
    message is that\r\nthe relationship between mothers and babies can not be â\x80\x9Creplacedâ\x80\x9D
    by\r\npaternal or other sorts of care. Perhaps because even the selective\r\nreporting
    of research findings that she uses to such great effect\r\nelsewhere wonâ\x80\x99t
    work to support this claim, Manne relies on anecdote and\r\nthe views of a famous
    Australian cartoonist, to make her case. She tells\r\nof arriving home early from
    the library to hear her daughter crying: â\x80\x9Câ\x80\x9DI\r\nrushed in to find
    my husbandâ\x80¦trying to soothe her. When I picked her up\r\nshe turned her head
    towards my shoulder. She took a long, deep,\r\nsuspicious sniff, turned her head
    to one side, smiled and fell asleep.\r\nShe smelt her mother.\"\r\n\r\nHaving
    approvingly cited Leunigâ\x80\x99s take on attachment theory, Manne\r\nsomewhat
    incoherently presents an anecdote about the inadequacies of\r\ngrandparental to
    make her case against institutional childcare: â\x80\x9CA\r\nperceptive grandmother,
    an exceptionally sensitive caregiver, who looked\r\nafter her two little grandchildren
    full-time while the mother worked,\r\nonce told of the oldest stopping deal in
    the middle of play and suddenly\r\ncrying out for her motherâ\x80\x99s face. \\`Whereâ\x80\x99s
    that dear face? Where is\r\nit?â\x80\x99â\x80\x99â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIt is worth
    pausing here to ask some questions about the implied moral\r\nof this story: that
    if a child ever misses her Mum the motherâ\x80\x99s absence\r\nis wronging the
    child and must be remedied. Is the pain of missing a\r\nbeloved other than a mother
    good enough reason to change care\r\narrangements too? Some babies cry whenever
    their mothers step into the\r\nshower, or attempt to go to the toilet or the doctor
    alone. Must good\r\nmothers abandon such solitary journeys? If the baby misses
    Dad at work\r\nor a sibling at school, must they also be tethered to home? Indeed,
    if\r\nwe ignore the implications of Manneâ\x80\x99s arguments and accept her claim
    to\r\nbelieve in the capacity of children to attach to both their fathers and\r\nmothers,
    doesnâ\x80\x99t the â\x80\x9Cmissing as tragedyâ\x80\x9D argument imply that what\r\nchildren
    need is 24/7 access to both parents?\r\n\r\nBut absent scholarship and faulty
    logic are only some of the problems\r\nplaguing Motherhood. The others reduce
    to honesty and integrity.\r\nMotherhood is a polemic that has nothing to do with
    â\x80\x9Cmoving beyond the\r\nmotherwarsâ\x80\x9D, and everything to do with championing
    the at-home mother as\r\nthe good one. Her advice to women confronting work/life
    dilemmas? You\r\ncan have it all, but â\x80\x9Cin sequenceâ\x80\x9D, not â\x80\x9Call
    at onceâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nMore disturbingly, Manne mischaracterizes key thinkers
    and important\r\ndebates. She claims that feminist Eva Cox said at-home mothers
    raise\r\nâ\x80\x9Cnarcissistic monsters incapable of sharingâ\x80\x9D, when a
    quick internet trip\r\nto the Boyer lectures reveals the complete lack of fit
    between this\r\ndescription and Coxâ\x80\x99s far more temperate point. Manne
    asserts that a\r\n2002 study by a university student claiming bad outcomes for
    small\r\nchildren spending long hours in daycare was â\x80\x9Cattacked on every
    media\r\noutletâ\x80\x9D. However, a review of the print media during this period
    reveals\r\nthat while news items were either slanted in favour of the study or
    were\r\nbalanced, 7 of the 8 opinion pieces lavishly praised the study and\r\ncastigated
    its mythical critics. The one exception was a piece by the\r\nhead of the Australian
    Institute of Family Studies refuting the claims\r\nof columnist Bettina Arndt
