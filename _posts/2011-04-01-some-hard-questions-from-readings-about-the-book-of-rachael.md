  content: "*The Book of Rachael is set in Israel 2000 years ago. In your Authorâ\x80\x99s
    Note you mention that you donâ\x80\x99t view the book as historical fiction. Where
    do you draw the line between fiction and historical accuracy and what historical
    details were important for you to get right?*\r\n\r\nI began the fiction-writing
    journey in a different place on this question to where I ended it. When I started
    The Book of Rachael, my experience was as an academic researcher and journalist.
    It was outside of the scope of possibility to write anything\r\n\r\nI didnâ\x80\x99t
    know or believe to be true based on available evidence. It was all I could do
    not to footnote! However, having written a first draft bristling with far too
    many, too precisely drawn facts and realising â\x80\x93 okay, so perhaps someone
    told me â\x80\x93 that it didnâ\x80\x99t work as a novel, I was forced to reconsider
    my position.\r\n\r\nUltimately, a novel has to work as a story and by the third
    draft of the story I finally understood this, not just in my head but my heart.
    There had also been enough time between drafts that the masses of knowl- edge
    Iâ\x80\x99d packed into my first go had faded. The knowledge or impressions that
    stuck with me were ones I decided must be most important to the story I was telling
    so I wrote the novel with these as the founda- tion stones and only returned to
    my tomes for further historical facts on an as-needs basis.\r\n\r\n*You have created
    a style of speech that seems to observe the conventions of the time but simultaneously
    feels fresh and modern. How did you go about finding the voices for your characters?*\r\n\r\nThat
    is so nice of you to say â\x80\x93 thanks! This was certainly among the most challenging
    aspects of making the novel work. I wrote and rewrote that first chapter many
    times, making very few changes on the nature or order of events I was recounting,
    but work- ing constantly with the voice. Throughout, I returned to the Gospels
    and the First Tes- tament to absorb the cadence and phrases of these texts, but
    combined this with fierce pragmatism. If more than one reader of the manuscript
    said, â\x80\x98thatâ\x80\x99s lovely, but what does it mean?â\x80\x99 or simply
    wrote â\x80\x98huh?â\x80\x99 in the margins, Iâ\x80\x99d usually â\x80\x93 not
    always, but usually â\x80\x93 bite the bullet and change it. My editor was also
    pretty clear about the merits and limits of the vernacular enterprise on which
    Iâ\x80\x99d embarked, and when she decided something was too ye-olde or just plain
    confusing, I was smart enough to give way.\r\n\r\n*You say that the impetus for
    this novel came from watching a BBC documentary about the life of Jesus. Can you
    talk a bit about this initial inspiration and where it led you?*\r\n\r\nI love
    documentaries, and many years ago I saw a BBC one about Jesus of Nazareth â\x80\x93
    the man, not the religious figure. It was broadcast over weeks, the narrator microscopically
    examining every shred of evidence about how Jesus lived and died. At one point,
    the names and fates, even the burial places, of his four brothers was canvassed
    before the breezy assertion was made that Jesus may have had sisters, too, but
    no one knew their names. The program moved on. But I was stuck. What kind of world
    painstakingly records the names and stories of important peopleâ\x80\x99s brothers,
    but not their sisters? What would it have been like for a girl to have come of
    age in such a world, especially if she was preternaturally bright, as well as
    determined? I decided right there that I would tell the stories of these forgotten
    women, feeling it was both an honour and a challenge to take on the task of reclaiming
    them for history. Eventu- ally, it came to feel like a responsibility, too, and
    it was this sense of duty to the sisters that kept me going during the lean years.\r\n\r\n*As
    a feminist, youâ\x80\x99ve written a book set in an era when women were totally
    subjugated by men. Do you see The Book of Rachael as a feminist novel? What were
    the intentions and tensions for you in writing of book?*\r\n\r\nI see the project
    of reclaiming women lost to history as a feminist project and of course Iâ\x80\x99m
    sympathetic to women born in times where their horizons were so limited. But itâ\x80\x99s
    a novel and so once the decision to write it was made, all such considerations
    were set aside so I could focus on the sole and difficult-to-achieve objective
    of every work of fiction: to be a bloody good yarn. Indeed the highest praise
    I have received for the book so far has been from a not- particularly-feminist
    bloke who told me he couldnâ\x80\x99t put it down for this reason.\r\n\r\n*You
    build a strong sense of how much the spirited protagonist Rachael struggles to
    find her place in the world. How do you think Rachael would fare in todayâ\x80\x99s
    society? And was this your way of writing the journey of womankind in general?*\r\n\r\nRachael
    would have loved being born today. I get a smile on my face just think- ing about
    her. Sheâ\x80\x99d be the prime minister or head of the UN or something. Perhaps
    sheâ\x80\x99d do this by not having kids, but she might manage even with a few.
    I wouldnâ\x80\x99t put anything past her.\r\n\r\n*You evoke a tremendous sense
    of place in your novel, I often felt like I was right there with the characters
    walking through the landscapes of ancient Israel. â\x80\x98Gethsemane ... where
    stone walls crumbled from the weight of years, and the branches of olive trees
    straggled towards God like a hagâ\x80\x99s withered arms.â\x80\x99 How did you
    go about constructing this world?*\r\n\r\nThanks again, this Q & A is really good
    for my self esteem! Look, I have been to Israel three times, though it was a number
    of years ago and way before I decided to write the book. Ideally, I would have
    travelled there again, but this just wasnâ\x80\x99t feasible. So I dragged out
    all the photos I took during those years and pasted them around my desk, surfed
    the net for more images and put them up, and then let my imagination build the
    rest of the picture based on the world described in the Bible.\r\n\r\nVisit www.readings.com.au
