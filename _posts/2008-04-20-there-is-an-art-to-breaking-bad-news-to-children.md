  content: "Last year, a girl at my sonâ\x80\x99s school primary school - letâ\x80\x99s
    call her\r\nSusan - had a headache. The next day she collapsed and since then
    has\r\nbeen in a wheelchair from spinal damage caused by a benign tumour.\r\n\r\nSusan
    and the other children were told that that she might not walk\r\nagain. Not that
    she would not, but that she might not. Only gradually\r\ndid it became clear to
    everyone - the little girl, her friends and the\r\nparent community - that walking
    was not on the cards.\r\n\r\nSusanâ\x80\x99s parents were clear and open about
    their familyâ\x80\x99s crisis. They\r\nposted a child-friendly explanation of
    what had happened to Susan, and\r\nfollow up â\x80\x9Cchaptersâ\x80\x9D of her
    story, in the school newsletter. They\r\nauthorised teachers to talk about Susan
    in class. This gave permission\r\nfor the children and everyone else to talk about
    what happened, express\r\ngrief, ask questions and make plans to help.\r\n\r\nBut
    in couching Susanâ\x80\x99s prognosis in possibilities rather than\r\ncertainties,
    were the parents guilty of telling a white lie, or even a\r\nbald-faced one?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely
    not. The reality is that adults have trouble levelling with\r\nkids even - or
    perhaps especially - when the issue matters. A majority\r\nof parents of donor-conceived
    children never tell their children the\r\ntruth about their conception As well,
    experts report chronic\r\ndifficulties in convincing parents of children facing
    catastrophic\r\nillness - those whoâ\x80\x99ve been born with AIDS, or diagnosed
    with\r\nlife-threatening cancer - to tell their children the truth about their\r\ncondition
    and prognosis.\r\n\r\nThe reasons why include parents being in denial themselves,
    feeling\r\nguilty or ashamed, or simply being unsure what to say. But whatever
    the\r\ncause, parents put their children at risk by withholding such critical\r\ninformation
    because if the secret gets out - and most secrets do - the\r\nchild may struggle
    to trust her parents or anyone else again. Parents\r\nalso have no right to deny
    children critical information about their\r\nhealth and lives. They hold such
    information in trust, but it is the\r\nmoral property of the child.\r\n\r\nOf
    course telling, like lying, can be done badly or well. To tell well,\r\nparents
    must be sensitive to the childâ\x80\x99s age, temperament and\r\nresilience.\r\n\r\nBy
    presenting their daughterâ\x80\x99s diagnosis as a possibility instead of a\r\ncertainty,
    Susanâ\x80\x99s parents offered her and the rest of us the chance to\r\nexplore
    the scariest of outcomes in a context that offered an emotional\r\nâ\x80\x9Coutâ\x80\x9D.
    This â\x80\x9Coutâ\x80\x9D was one I saw my own son take a number of times.\r\nBriefly
    contemplating the wheelchair as a permanent fixture in Susanâ\x80\x99s\r\nlife,
    he would suddenly switch off, telling me that we didnâ\x80\x99t have to\r\nthink
    about this too much, because it might not happen. But as the\r\nmonths passed,
    I noticed he could meditate on the idea that Susan might\r\nnot recover for longer
    and longer periods. This meant that when the\r\nfinal prognosis was laid bare,
    he and the other children were quick to\r\naccept it and to move on to discussions
    about helping Susan to return to\r\nschool full-time.\r\n\r\nSo while it is true
    that honesty is the best policy, there is an art to\r\nbreaking bad news. What
    Susanâ\x80\x99s parents taught me is this when kids need\r\nto be told difficult
    things, adults need to speak plainly and openly,\r\nand to stage disclosures in
    ways that give the children time to process\r\nthe information and move through
    the pain."
