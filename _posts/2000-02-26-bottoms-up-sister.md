    Granger.\r\nBut after most episodes, my stomach hurts - figuratively, that is.
    Which\r\nmay be better than the literal way the vicarâ\x80\x99s must feel. Because
    at\r\nsome point in each episode of the show, Geraldine does some serious\r\neating:
    a freezerâ\x80\x99s worth of icecream, a cupboard full of chocolate\r\nbars, an
    entire Yule Log. That sort of thing.\r\n\r\nI know that as a feminist Iâ\x80\x99m
    meant to feel liberated by the vicarâ\x80\x99s\r\neating. Because - and here I
    quote Frenchâ\x80\x99s own website - underlying\r\nFrenchâ\x80\x99s comedy sketches
    about her \\`\\`chocaholismâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99 and her weight is a\r\n\\`\\`message
    for all of us to read. Dawn French is fat. And beautiful.\r\nAnd proud.â\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\n\r\nFrench
    believes, the website goes on, that being big is \\`\\`something to\r\ncelebrate
    rather than be ashamed ofâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99. Indeed, French has launched her\r\nown
    clothing shops that provide \\`\\`beautiful clothesâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 for big
    girls,\r\nand she has posed nude for Esquire magazine in a bid to create\r\n\\`\\`modern
    imagesâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99 of women where \\`\\`big means beautifulâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nI
    support Frenchâ\x80\x99s contention that big women can be beautiful, and\r\nshould
    be proud. I believe \\`\\`societyâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99 and \\`\\`the mediaâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99
    should get\r\noff the backs of all women - be they Calista Flockhart or Camryn
    Manheim\r\n- about their body size. But is that really the message the vicar\r\ndelivers?\r\n\r\nTo
    some degree, yes. Geraldine is not just her crammed cream buns, and\r\nironically
    it is when she is not eating that the \\`\\`fat is beautifulâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\nmessage
    comes through loud and clear. The vicar is clearly happy with\r\nand proud of
    her body.\r\n\r\nBut when the vicar begins eating, all bets are off. This is not
    because\r\nIâ\x80\x99m squeamish about fat people eating - yes I know they had
    to get fat\r\nsomehow - but because of the way and the reasons why the vicar eats.
    She\r\neats compulsively, sometimes in a highly stylised or ritualised manner,\r\nusually
    when she isnâ\x80\x99t hungry and as a way of expressing - or it is\r\nrepressing?
    - her feelings.\r\n\r\nWhen anorexics and bulimics do this, we label it a disease
    and try,\r\noften fruitlessly, to treat it. We understand eating in this way is
    a\r\nsymptom of these womenâ\x80\x99s unhappiness: a sign of anger and powerlessness\r\nturned
    in against the self. Yet when the vicar eats an entire\r\ndisplay-sized freezer
    full of Haagen Daz as a sop for her broken heart,\r\nwe laugh. When she proceeds
    on to the avalanche of Crunchies stored\r\nunder the sink with a resigned \\`\\`I
    suppose I better start on these\r\nthenâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99, we enthuse, \\`\\`right
    on sister!â\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s easy to see how we got so confused.
    Big \\`\\`role modelsâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99 for women\r\nare in short supply. French
    not only accepts this position\r\nenthusiastically, she uses her social and financial
    clout to expose the\r\nconsumerist evils of the diet industry and the bias against
    fat women\r\nthat riddles our society. She rightly lambasts the entertainment\r\nindustry
    for pigeonholing fat women by insisting all roles have to have\r\n\\`\\`bigâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99
    in the job description.\r\n\r\nFrench and her characters challenge the stigma
    about women eating at all\r\nin public, little less eating fattening things and
    lots of them - and we\r\nlove her for it.\r\n\r\nYet in our adoration, we have
    ignored the fact that some of Geraldineâ\x80\x99s\r\nattitudes and behaviors around
    food cross the line. We wouldnâ\x80\x99t cheer so\r\nbriskly if, after downing
    the last chocolate bar, the vicar made a brisk\r\njoke about toothbrush handles
    and headed for the toilet. But does\r\nwolfing down food - despite being full
    and as a salve for emotional pain\r\n- display any less confusion about the relationship
    between eating and\r\nemotion than wolfing it up?\r\n\r\nResearch tells us that
    most women who are compulsive eaters arenâ\x80\x99t\r\nhappy. Food runs their
    lives and they feel out of control. Women deserve\r\nthe freedom to be whatever
    size they want and to have a healthy\r\nrelationship with food. The model French
    provides in the vicar takes us\r\nonly half way."
