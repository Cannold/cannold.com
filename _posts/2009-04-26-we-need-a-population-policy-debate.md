    that\r\nthe stress and disagreement that has long characterized the debate about\r\nmigration
    is over. We all agree now that itâ\x80\x99s the people-smugglers we\r\nlove to
    hate. People smugglers, the PM said, are â\x80\x9Cthe absolute scum of\r\nthe
    earth.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nAustralians disagree about migration. We always have. Since
    the 1960s,\r\nopinion polls have shown those with more education support higher
    levels\r\nof migration than those with a trade qualification or high-school\r\ndegree.
    A 2003 a national survey by the ANU found 41 per cent of\r\nuniversity graduates
    thought immigration should be increased. Only 17\r\nper cent of those with a trade
    qualifications or a high-school education\r\nagreed.\r\n\r\nOnly a few years ago,
    such disagreements were significant enough to\r\nswing an election. The Howard
    government leveraged them as part of the\r\nculture wars. The left aided such
    divisive efforts by implying that\r\nmigration skeptics were not just wrong, but
    morally suspect.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Australians have real disagreements
    not just about\r\nboat people, but our entire approach to population, including
    policies\r\non fertility and migration. While there will always be a portion of\r\nHanson
    sympathizers among migration skeptics, most are not racist and\r\nreact angrily
    at suggestions they are.\r\n\r\nI migrated to Australia twenty years ago. I was
    born in the States,\r\nwhere my great-grandparents migrated from Eastern Europe
    to escape the\r\npogroms. I feel compassion for those who give up their language,
    culture\r\nand families to leave their homes to seek a safer and better life in\r\nAustralia.
    I know how hard new migrants work, how much contribute to\r\ntheir new homeland,
    and how fiercely loyal they can be to the country\r\nthat grants them refuge and
    the chance to give their kids a better life.\r\n\r\nBut Iâ\x80\x99ve also done
    enough traveling to know that we are on a good wicket\r\nin the west, including
    here in Australia. You donâ\x80\x99t have to be too flash\r\nat math to know that
    if too many come to this country too quickly, the\r\nquality of life for those
    already here could be put at risk.\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s a dilemma, and one that
    joining forces to snipe about those nasty\r\npeople-smugglers will do nothing
    to resolve. Should we want to calm the\r\nwaters around this issue-really calm
    the waters-we need to stop\r\npretending the handful of boats that arrive each
    year are the problem,\r\nand stopping people smugglers the solution.\r\n\r\nInstead,
    we need to give the public greater opportunity to contribute in\r\na calm and
    reasoned way to shaping our national outlook on fertility and\r\nmigration.\r\n\r\nIt
    may be the lack of a legitimate opportunity to contribute to\r\npopulation policy
    that sees the electorate over-react each time an\r\nun-seaworthy boat reaches
    our shores. Despite history showing that at\r\nleast 90 per cent of those on board
    are likely to be legitimate\r\nrefugees, the boats remind us of how unsettled
    we feel about all aspects\r\nof population policy. Because the boats get the get
    the attention of the\r\nmedia and the politicians, they provide the chance - through
    talkback\r\nand the letters pages - to express concern about the whole issue.\r\n\r\nThe
    Federal Government has not inquired into population policy since the\r\nstart
    of the 1990s. Itâ\x80\x99s high time this changed.\r\n\r\nWe need to put the real
    issues on the table and to debate them, fair and\r\nsquare."
