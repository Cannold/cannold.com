    children by bullies. I wince when I hear the stories, wince through\r\nidentification

    is easier to talk about being a victim than of victimising others, to\r\nspeak
    of abused innocence rather than malevolent guilt. Itâ\x80\x99s also easier\r\nbecause
    I remember so much more about the emotions and strategies of\r\nvictimisation
    - the initial show of defiance that began the bullying,\r\nthe weeks spent hiding

    next time, several years later in a different\r\nschool, I waited out my social
    exile with greater equanimity. I still\r\nhid out, this time with those on the
    periphery of my gang forced to take\r\nremedial English during lunch, but was
    confident that adherence to my\r\nmotherâ\x80\x99s instruction - â\x80\x9Cdonâ\x80\x99t
    react and theyâ\x80\x99ll find someone more\r\ninteresting to teaseâ\x80\x9D -
    would eventually bring the warring party to the\r\ntable. When it did, I turned
    the bristling discontent at the general\r\nnastiness of gang leadership and its
    penchant for internal bullying into\r\na revolt that landed me in the gangâ\x80\x99s
    Top Dog position.\r\n\r\nIn America, such a girl wins the epithet â\x80\x9Cmost
    popular girlâ\x80\x9D. I\r\ndiscovered this when, several years after graduating
    from university, I\r\nran into a boy whoâ\x80\x99d been in my year at school and
    who introduced me to\r\nhis mother with this title.\r\n\r\nDuring those years,
    I was unaware of the power our gangâ\x80\x99s casual cruelty\r\nor even indifference
    had over classmates - they were terrified of us,\r\nsomething I learned in my
    last year of high school. I had dropped out of\r\nthe main high school to become
    a student at the Alternative (or â\x80\x9CAâ\x80\x9D)\r\nschool after ditching
    cheerleading, gaining a few stones and performing\r\nother rituals associated
    with a popular-girl-drop-out. I was washing my\r\nhands when a fellow â\x80\x9CAâ\x80\x9D-schooler
    casually remarked: â\x80\x9CI remember when you\r\nand your gang had the biggest
    screaming match in here. You were there,\r\nand Amy was there and Cynthia was
    crying and then someone called me a\r\ngeek and pushed Vicki into a stall and
    she hit her leg and got a bruise\r\nmark that lasted for weeks. And then â\x80¦â\x80\x9D
    The story went on and on.\r\n\r\nWhile my new friend recalled every last insult
    and each casual cruelty,\r\nI remembered none of it. What sounded like a formative
    experience for\r\nher I couldnâ\x80\x99t even recall.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I do
    remember is the impact the words of a teacher had on\r\nmy behavior.\r\n\r\nFlash
    back to junior high school. Iâ\x80\x99m 11 and playing Robyn to Cynthiaâ\x80\x99s\r\nBatman.
    Back then, she wasnâ\x80\x99t just â\x80\x9Cthe prettiest girlâ\x80\x9D, she was
    also\r\nâ\x80\x9Cthe most popularâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nOur prey was Sarah, a girl
    cursed with parents who were among the most\r\nhated teachers at school. Sarahâ\x80\x99s
    mother also refused to buy her a bra\r\nto soften out the sharp points of her
    developing breasts. These were the\r\nâ\x80\x9Ccrimesâ\x80\x9D as I remember them,
    and Cynthia and I made Sarah pay dearly.\r\n\r\nWe teased what she said and how
    she said it, we mocked her clothes, and\r\nthe size and wantonness of her breasts.
    We encouraged the boys, all\r\neager to curry our favor, to give her titty twisters.\r\n\r\nMs
    Moore, a kind grandmotherly woman, held us back one afternoon after\r\ndismissing
    the rest of the class.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CYou are both beautiful and bright girls,â\x80\x9D
    she said gently, â\x80\x9Cbut you are\r\nbehaving cruelly to Sarah.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nCynthia
    and I protested that it was the boys, but Ms Moore cut us off.\r\nâ\x80\x9CI think
    you both know what you are doing and itâ\x80\x99s wrong. The other kids\r\nlook
    up to you and follow you, if you stop, theyâ\x80\x99ll follow your lead.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nShe
    dismissed us with a disappointed wave of her hand.\r\n\r\nCynthia was incensed
    that we had been singled out for treatment when the\r\nwhole class had participated
    in Sarahâ\x80\x99s torture. I listened to her rant\r\nin silence, mortified and
    deeply ashamed.\r\n\r\nI made sure in the intervening years that I remained silent
    and\r\nperipheral to the group when weâ\x80\x99d roam the playground in our clogs
    -\r\nearning us the moniker â\x80\x9CThe Herdâ\x80\x9D - in search of a victim.\r\n\r\nI
    still remember trailing The Herd with Jill, both of us trying to\r\nbecome as
    small as possible when proceedings had begun with the dayâ\x80\x99s\r\nvictim.
    We were ashamed but remained silent for years, too afraid that\r\nspeaking up
    would turn the abuse on us.\r\n\r\nWhen I ascended the â\x80\x9Cmost popularâ\x80\x9D
    throne, my reign was characterised by\r\nan absence of internecine and extra-curricular
    bullying and Jillâ\x80\x99s\r\nstatus in the group metamorphosed from hanger-on
    to â\x80\x9Csecond most popular\r\ngirlâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nBut Iâ\x80\x99ll forgive
    our victims if they didnâ\x80\x99t even notice."
