    women have just inched one step closer to gaining access to\r\nRU486. Last week,
    Cairns-based obstetrician Dr Caroline De Costa\r\nreceived word that her application
    to become an authorised prescriber of\r\nthe medication had been approved by the
    national drug regulator, the\r\nTherapeutic Goods Administration.\r\n\r\nDespite
    the fanfare surrounding Februaryâ\x80\x99s passage of the cross-party\r\nbill
    that removed the Heath Ministerâ\x80\x99s veto over the TGAâ\x80\x99s decision
    to\r\nregister the drug, pregnant women are still awaiting access to the\r\nmedication
    - as a morning-after pill, to assist in labour or to\r\nterminate a very early
    pregnancy without surgery - because no company\r\nhas submitted an application.\r\n\r\nWhile
    De Costaâ\x80\x99s approval as an authorised prescriber comes with\r\nrestrictions
    that preclude her from supplying other medical\r\npractitioners with the drug,
    or accepting patients living outside far\r\nnorth Queensland, it both signals
    and further strengthens the case for\r\nTGA registration of the drug when an application
    is finally submitted.\r\nThis is because to say â\x80\x9Cyesâ\x80\x9D to De Costa,
    the TGA has to evaluate the\r\ndrugâ\x80\x99s safety and efficacy against the
    seriousness of the condition, and\r\nthe acceptability of existing therapies to
    treat it. Signing off on her\r\napplication signals the regulatorâ\x80\x99s acceptance
    of the veracity and\r\nquality of the research data demonstrating the drugâ\x80\x99s
    safety and\r\nefficacy that De Costa was required to submit to support her\r\napplication.
    This bodes well for requests before the TGA from other\r\nmedicos wanting to become
    authorised prescribers and an application by a\r\npharmaceutical company - when
    one finally is made - to make the drug\r\nmore broadly available.\r\n\r\nPro-choice
    supporters would also have been heartened by the recent\r\nelevation of the staunchly
    pro-choice Louise Asher to the position of\r\ndeputy leader of the Liberal Party
    in Victoria to join pro-choice leader\r\nRobert Doyle. With the Victorian Labor
    Party having recently affirmed\r\nits commitment to amend the Victorian Crimes
    Act to make abortion legal\r\nwhen a woman gives her informed consent, the stage
    is set for change\r\nafter the election in November.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, however,
    pro-life forces are making their influence felt. As\r\nin Victoria, the Crimes
    Act in NSW prohibits abortion. Earlier this\r\nmonth, the Crown prosecutor in
    the case of NSW doctor Dr Suman Sood\r\nmoved to amend the indictment to include
    a second charge of\r\nadministering a drug with â\x80\x9Cintent to procure a miscarriageâ\x80\x9D.
    If Sood is\r\nconvicted, womenâ\x80\x99s access to safe, legal terminations could
    be reduced\r\nin NSW through the narrowing of the reach of the 1971 and 1995 common\r\nlaw
    judgements that enable lawful abortion.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps nowhere have pro-life
    forces been more successful than in\r\ntheir co-option of the word â\x80\x9Ccounsellingâ\x80\x9D
    to pursue their goal of\r\nreducing womenâ\x80\x99s access to abortion.\r\n\r\nIn
    addition to being on the Federal Government payroll to the tune of\r\n$295,000
    in 2005 and 2006, the pro-life Australian Federation of\r\nPregnancy Support Services
    (formerly the Australian Federation of\r\nPro-Life Pregnancy Support Services)
    is manoeuvring to win the tender to\r\nprovide a national telephone helpline to
    support women to keep\r\npregnancies. The helpline, one of two recently announced
    â\x80\x9Cpregnancy\r\nsupport measuresâ\x80\x9D, is seen as compensation for Health
    Minister Tony\r\nAbbottâ\x80\x99s loss of control over RU486.\r\n\r\nWill AFPSS
    win the helpline tender? Theyâ\x80\x99re certainly in contention,\r\nbecause while
    the Government has ruled out abortion providers from\r\ntendering for the contract
    to ensure the provision of a â\x80\x9Cnon-directiveâ\x80\x9D\r\nservice, organisations
    with a religious or philosophical opposition to\r\nabortion have been deemed to
    have the professionalism and\r\neven-handedness necessary to apply.\r\n\r\nWhile
    some Australians might question the appropriateness of the Federal\r\nGovernment
    coat of arms being attached to a telephone hotline staffed by\r\na service with
    a principled opposition to advising or referring for\r\nabortion, few would dispute
    the right of women to be told up-front and\r\nunequivocally if a service will
    provide accurate information about, and\r\nrefer for, abortion. Yet there is no
    consumer protection regulation in\r\nany state that prohibits pregnancy clinics
    from falsely advertising\r\ntheir services. Because the services donâ\x80\x99t
    levy a fee, the Australian\r\nCompetition and Consumer Commission cannot charge
    them with engaging in\r\nmisleading or deceptive advertising.\r\n\r\nLast year,
    Pregnancy Counselling Australia, which has links to\r\ninternational pro-life
    pregnancy centres, sent posters to GPs across the\r\ncountry. Depicting the photo
    of a young attractive woman chewing her\r\nnails the text read: â\x80\x9CPregnant?
    Upset?â\x80\x9D â\x80\x9CFree, confidential,\r\ncompassionate, counsellingâ\x80\x9D
    on a 24-hour basis was promised to women who\r\nrang the number provided. While
    the vast majority of GPs are pro-choice,\r\nmany were fooled by the poster and
    the accompanying covering letter that\r\nimplied that Pregnancy Counselling Australia
    offered a service that\r\nwould support and refer women for all three options
    with an unplanned\r\npregnancy: adoption, continuing and abortion. As Pregnancy
    Counselling\r\nAustralia requested, many put the poster in their consulting suites
    and\r\nwaiting rooms.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats have developed a private memberâ\x80\x99s
    bill to ensure truth in\r\nadvertising when it comes to pregnancy support services.
    To become law,\r\nthis bill - or one like it - will need cross-party support.
    The question\r\nis: after the battle over RU486, do pro-choice activists and politicians\r\nhave
    the energy to battle as hard as will be required to achieve basic\r\nconsumer
    protection for pregnant women?"
