    in particular the ABC, did an excellent job of\r\nkeeping Victorians informed.
    Rolling coverage of the location of fires,\r\nand threat warnings by the CFA,
    were essential for bush-dwellers needing\r\nto decide whether to prepare, stay
    and defend or leave early. Indeed, a\r\ncommunity meeting at Kinglake, one of
    the communities devastated by the\r\nblaze, agreed that, â\x80\x9C99% of the coverage

    coverage is the\r\npublic navel-gazing currently being undertaken by the media
    about the\r\nway it has covered the disaster. Thereâ\x80\x99s nothing wrong with
    the media\r\nusing the media to yak about itself. Itâ\x80\x99s an important and
    powerful\r\ninstitution and the way it goes about its business is a matter of
    public\r\nconcern. Rather, what worries me about the public self-flagellation
    is\r\nthat it will not solve the problem. Indeed, over-rating the importance\r\nof

    needed to actually fix the problem.\r\n\r\nSo what should we be doing?\r\n\r\nWe
    need to accept that we can change. All we need is the will, and a\r\ndecision
    to convene a round-table, with media representatives, relevant\r\ngovernment departments,
    disaster relief organizations and trauma\r\nexperts, to develop guidelines for
    reporting on disasters and strategies\r\nfor getting the media to adhere to such
    rules in their day-to-day work.\r\n\r\nThere are precedents for such an approach.
    Several years ago, concerns\r\nsurfaced about the risks posed to vulnerable members
    of the community by\r\ncareless media reporting of suicide. In response, a number
    of considered\r\nand practical guidelines were developed to assist media organisations
    to\r\nunderstand the potential for harm, and how their reporting could avoid\r\nit.
    Many Australian journalists are exposed to the guidelines during\r\ntheir training
