title: 'Leslie joins IPA''s Patterson & and Mumble''s Brent on ABC TV''s The Drum '
---
In this segment, Leslie and Peter question the Institute of Public Affair's Patterson's view that  the society = the economy, and that what's good for business is what's good for society.  

The discussion was prompted by Don Argus's [assertion](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/economics/its-time-to-put-the-nations-prosperity-before-politics/story-e6frg926-1226422919692) in The Australian that the Gillard Labor was complacent about the economy, and the implied claim of Argus's defenders that he has particular insight into - or concern about - what economic policies are best for all of us. 

Watch the video (13 min 40 - 21 min 10). Then read The Australian's [comment](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/media/cannold-bangs-the-drum/story-e6frg996-1226424468244) on the tone and content of Leslie's position - and see what you think.
