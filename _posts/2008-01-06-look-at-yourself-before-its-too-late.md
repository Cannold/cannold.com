    And what\r\ndoes dedicating ourselves to closing the gap between what we wanted
    for\r\nour lives and how we are actually living them have to do with ethics?\r\n\r\nThe
    relevance of this question became clear when meeting for drinks with\r\nsome mates
    in the run-up to Christmas. â\x80\x9CGeorgeâ\x80\x9D had a few too many, then\r\nblurted
    out his profound sense of shame about being a green grocer. â\x80\x9CI\r\nfeel
    embarrassed to even tell people thatâ\x80\x99s what I do,â\x80\x9D he confessed.\r\nOnce,
    he had earned his keep as a musician, but years earlier had given\r\nit up.\r\n\r\nLike
    most of us, he could produce reasons: the incompatibility of the\r\nall-hours
    itinerant lifestyle of rock bands with the demands of a young\r\nfamily; the need
    for a more reliable income. And yet his feelings of\r\ngrief and self-loathing
    about opportunities lost were palpable.\r\n\r\nSome of us have no choice but to
    sell ourselves short. Perhaps we are\r\nthe main breadwinners in households that
    barely scrape by or, as was the\r\ncase for a young woman I know, are the only
    possible carer for a\r\ndependant relative. Maybe the needs and wants of our partners
    or\r\nchildren are incompatible with ours, and must take precedence in the\r\nshort
    or long term.\r\n\r\nFor others, however, the picture is less clear. Research
    conducted over\r\ndecades confirms that beyond the level of income needed to fulfil
    our\r\nbasic needs, additional income does not increase our life satisfaction.\r\nYet
    despite this, many of us work longer hours than we want at jobs we\r\ndespise
    in the desperate hope that one more purchase - the jaunty sports\r\ncar, the renovations,
    the new dress - will finally deliver the happiness\r\nour consumerist culture
    promises (to make matters worse, rises in income\r\nmay transitorily increase
    our satisfaction, potentially prompting us to\r\npursue that next salary rise
    in search of another emotional rush). For\r\nmen, such hamster-laps on the work-spend
    wheel may reinforce traditional\r\nmasculine identity, long associated with provision.\r\n\r\nDefining
    our own good, and living our lives in pursuit of it, is at the\r\nheart of a moral
    life. Aristotle thought that developing oneâ\x80\x99s skills\r\nand talents was
    essential to the project of living a virtuous life,\r\nwhich he understood as
    synonymous with the pursuit of happiness.\r\n\r\nMost of us know that the best
    way to get the measure of our own lives is\r\nto imagine ourselves on our deathbeds
    looking back at our choices and\r\ndeeds. What will we judge as worthy of our
    time and effort, and what a\r\nwaste of both? Which journeys and detours will
    we cherish, and which\r\nwill we regret?\r\n\r\nYet most of us avoid the scenario,
    even when directly invited to\r\nconsider it. Even in the wake of Georgeâ\x80\x99s
    confession that night in the\r\npub, my friends were no different. Suddenly, everyone
    was otherwise\r\noccupied. â\x80\x9CI love this song,â\x80\x9D noted one, drumming
    his hands on the table\r\nto the beat, while two others simultaneously noticed
    our empty pots and\r\npractically cracked heads getting to the bar for another
    round.\r\n\r\nSuch avoidance is understandable. The examined life solicits emotional\r\nattention
    and remedial response, while the unexamined enables us to\r\ncarry on as we have
    been. Our lives are the sum total of our decisions,\r\nthough these are not always
    freely made. To stare at the product of such\r\nefforts and admit they are wanting
    is to imply both the possibility and\r\nnecessity for change and its corollary:
    moral responsibility for failing\r\nto change it. And the risks donâ\x80\x99t
    end there. Making changes to oneâ\x80\x99s\r\nlife, particularly fundamental ones
    that affect spouses and kids, is\r\nalso fraught, with its disruptions and the
    ever-present possibility that\r\nthings will go badly. Better, some of us clearly
    feel, to keep head down\r\nand bum up in the hope that the quantity rather than
    quality of our\r\nefforts, and determination to keep faith with the consumerist
    recipes\r\nfor success with which we will all raised, will eventually find its\r\nreward.\r\n\r\nAnd
    if this werenâ\x80\x99t enough to keep us on the straight and narrow, our\r\nrationalisations
    for avoiding the hard questions may be\r\nself-reinforcing. It is human nature
    to strive to reduce dissonance\r\nbetween what we do and what we believe, with
    behaviour shaping our\r\nthoughts far more powerfully than the other way around.
    When what we do\r\nconflicts with our values, in other words, it is our values
    that tend to\r\ngive way. So, in the same way that those who wish to believe in
    God\r\nshould simply start praying, those who want to keep faith with the life\r\nthey
    are currently living need do little more than continue to live it.\r\n\r\nFor
    what itâ\x80\x99s worth, I need to say that I donâ\x80\x99t think its good enough.\r\nNo
    matter our age, or the things weâ\x80\x99ve said or done in the past, it is\r\nnever
    too late to live the examined lie. To remember the dreams we had\r\nfor ourselves
    - the talents we sought to develop, the contribution we\r\nwished to make during
    our lifetimes both big and small - and to put them\r\ninto action.\r\n\r\nTo sprint
    towards the finish line, before itâ\x80\x99s too late."
