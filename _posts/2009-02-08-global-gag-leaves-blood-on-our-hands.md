    world that limits its foreign aid in this way.\r\n\r\nWhat is the global gag?
    In Australia, they are policy guidelines\r\ninstituted by the Howard Government

    or access to safe\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nIf Smith lifts the gag (and he can do so
    administratively, no new\r\nlegislation is required) he puts Laborâ\x80\x99s own
    conservative Christian\r\nmembers off side, and alienates Family First Senator
    Stephen Fielding,\r\nwho believes that his opposition faith-based opposition to
    safe abortion\r\nand most modern contraception is a sound basis for denying women
    in\r\ndeveloping countries information about, and access to such services,\r\neven
    when they are legal.\r\n\r\nIf the Minister keeps the gag tight, he makes you
    and I-taxpayers whose\r\nfunds are being diverted from legitimate family planning
    programs to\r\nchurch-approved ones that teach abstinence and â\x80\x9Cnaturalâ\x80\x9D
    family planning\r\nmethods proven not to work-complicit in the suffering and death
    of women\r\nin the developing world. Suffering and death caused by continual forced\r\npregnancies,
    and the horrific consequences of unsafe abortion, including\r\nsterility and the
    orphaning of children through the deaths of their\r\nmothers.\r\n\r\nAn estimated
    19 million unsafe abortions are carried out each year in\r\ndeveloping countries.
    According to UNICEF, unsafe self-inflicted methods\r\ninclude the consumption
    of detergents, strong tea, alcohol mixes and\r\nmalaria tablets, as well as the
    insertion of knitting needles, sharpened\r\nreeds and clothes hangers. Unqualified
    providers also carry out\r\nprocedures, usually in unregulated and unsanitary
    conditions.\r\n\r\nThe result? 68,000 women die each year from unsafe abortion,
    with\r\nhundreds of thousands more are injured or maimed. \\\r\nAccording to IPAS,
    an international organization dedicated to preventing\r\nabortion-related deaths,
    more than 500,000 women have died from unsafe\r\nabortions during the eight years
    of the last Bush administration, which\r\nre-imposed the gag the moment it took
    office.\r\n\r\nThe gag rule puts blood on our hands.\r\n\r\nDeaths from unsafe
    abortion are entirely preventable, but they cannot be\r\nprevented if the 200
    million women the United Nations estimates want to\r\ndelay or avoid pregnancy
    are denied access to comprehensive information\r\nabout pregnancy prevention,
    and access to contraception and safe\r\nabortion. They can be prevented, according
    to Shalini Nataraj of the\r\nGlobal Fund for Women, with funding for holistic,
    culturally appropriate\r\nand realistic reproductive health programs that tell
    women the whole\r\ntruth about their options, and offer them modern medical help
    to\r\nimplement their choices.\r\n\r\nSo which way will Smith jump? The truth
    is, no one knows. He has been\r\nâ\x80\x9Cconsideringâ\x80\x9D the issue since
    the Parliamentary Group on Population and\r\nDevelopment delivered a comprehensive
    report recommending the ban be\r\nlifted more than a year ago. To those keen for
    a decision to be made\r\nsooner rather than later, he had this to say. â\x80\x9CWeâ\x80\x99ll
    do it in our own\r\ntime. Weâ\x80\x99re not going to be driven by the decision
    that President Obama\r\nhas made.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nBut with unsafe abortion causing
    13 percent of all maternal deaths\r\nworldwide, many in our region, Iâ\x80\x99d
    say the matter is urgent.\r\n\r\nIf you agree, you might want to give Smithâ\x80\x99s
    office a call, or send an\r\nemail, to let him know itâ\x80\x99s time."
