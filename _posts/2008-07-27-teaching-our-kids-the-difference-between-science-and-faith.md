    the fundamentalist Christian\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, they need
    to get past their moral indignation at the\r\nslick and cynical use by bible-bashers
    of the language and values of the\r\nprogressive left. To do this, they need to
    stop arguing against the\r\nlegislation on the grounds that Darwinian evolution
    is â\x80\x9Caccepted\r\nscientific fact,â\x80\x9D and get on with turning the
    stated goals of the new\r\nâ\x80\x9Cacademic freedomâ\x80\x9D legislation to their
    advantage.\r\n\r\nBecause at the heart of this debate is not evolution, or any
    other\r\nanswer to key questions that the scientific method turns up at a point\r\nin
    history, but the workings of the method itself. Currently, primary\r\nand secondary
    school children are taught scientific content: the\r\nconclusions of scientific
    investigation into questions like â\x80\x9Chow did\r\nlife on earth begin?â\x80\x9D
    Only when students enter university, are the\r\nmethods used to reach such conclusions
    properly explained and used to\r\ncritique contemporary answers to key questions.\r\n\r\nThis
    is ass-around backwards. As business leaders have been telling us\r\nfor years,
    what we need in our rapid-fire world, where knowledge dates\r\nfaster than it
    takes to chew a piece of gum, is people who know how to\r\nassess the value of
    new information andâ\x80\x94where it is deemed valid and\r\nvaluableâ\x80\x94to
    acquire it. People, in other words, who donâ\x80\x99t know stuff,\r\nbut know
    how to think.\r\n\r\nNo matter how widely accepted it is today, no theoryâ\x80\x94including\r\nevolutionâ\x80\x94is
    beyond question. The accumulation of enough\r\ncounter-evidence, or the successful
    questioning of the method or logic\r\nused to develop the theory in the first
    place, will topple it in the\r\nsort of paradigm shift that makes academic careers
    and defines human\r\nprogress. This is how reason and evidence-based systems,
    of which\r\nscience is one, work.\r\n\r\nOnly by accepting this, and by turning
    the ruthless objectivity of\r\nreason and evidence-based systems to their advantage,
    can those seeking\r\nto defend modern ways of knowing against pre-enlightenment
    ones based on\r\nfaith, tradition or plain superstition, prevail.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    the latest manifestation of creationism, and the threat it poses\r\nto post-enlightenment
    ways of doing business, could prompt educators to\r\nlisten. To stop stuffing
    our primary and secondary school children with\r\nreams of content certain to
    date, and to teach them instead to consider\r\nthe validity of the varying methods
    humans have tried over time to\r\ndecide what is right and true.\r\n\r\nIf they
    know this we wonâ\x80\x99t have to tell them that creationism, or\r\nwhatever
    theory the faith-based crowd decide to throw at us next year,\r\nis something
    we can choose to believe it, but not something we can know.\r\n\r\nThey will be
