  content: "A new ruling may end discrimination in access to donor sperm.\r\n\r\nSHOULD
    everyone have the freedom to parent? Fitness for parenthood has\r\nbeen a hot
    topic in Victoria recently. Reports of children locked in hot\r\ncars, and the
    Melbourne Magistrates Courtâ\x80\x99s dismissal of charges against\r\ntwo gay
    police officers who used IVF to have a baby, have forced us to\r\nthink about
    who is - and is not - fit to parent.\r\n\r\nQuestions of parental fitness are
    unlikely to have confronted the\r\nparents of the children left in cars, because
    most were - or appeared to\r\nbe - straight, married and fertile. But because
    both police officers are\r\ngay and the female cop is involved in a stable de
    facto relationship\r\nwith another woman, they are forbidden under the Victorian
    Infertility\r\nTreatment Act from access to assisted reproductive technology,
    including\r\ndonor sperm. The act also denies treatment to single women.\r\n\r\nThe
    thinking behind these denials is clear: that it is not in a childâ\x80\x99s\r\ninterests
    to be born to single women or lesbian couples, because these\r\nwomen are not
    fit parents.\r\n\r\nThe singling out of single women and lesbians as unfit parents
    is\r\nstaggeringly inconsistent and unfair. Widows are single parents, yet no\r\none
    suggests the lack of a male partner makes them unfit mothers.\r\n\r\nBeing gay
    is like being black or male or straight - a natural attribute\r\nbeyond a personâ\x80\x99s
    control and irrelevant to her capacity to get the job\r\ndone. Numerous studies
    examining the wellbeing of children of single\r\nwomen and lesbians show such
    children generally fare well.\r\n\r\nThe impulse to differentiate between those
    who should and should not be\r\nentrusted with the responsibilities of parenthood
    is ubiquitous,\r\nunderstandable and - at times - honorable. Who among us hasnâ\x80\x99t
    muttered,\r\nâ\x80\x9Cthere oughtta be a lawâ\x80\x9D upon news of a particularly
    heinous case of\r\nchild abuse?\r\n\r\nThoughts of restricting the freedom to
    parent, however, founder on the\r\nrocks of implementation. When, how often and
    in what manner would the\r\nparental fitness of the enormous population of fertile
    people be\r\nassessed, and by whom? How would a person deemed unfit to parent
    be\r\nstopped from having a child: mandatory weekly pregnancy tests and forced\r\nabortions?\r\n\r\nControlling
    the physically infertile or those - such as lesbian or\r\nsingle women - facing
    social infertility is a less overwhelming task.\r\nPerhaps thatâ\x80\x99s why
    there are various state laws and codes that attempt\r\nit.\r\n\r\nParenting is
    a responsibility, not a right, and the past behavior of\r\nsome individuals may
    suggest they are not up to the task. But the key\r\nconcepts here are \\`\\`past
    behaviorâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99 and \\`\\`individualsâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99. While it\r\nmay
    be legitimate to deny a person the right to infertility treatment at\r\na particular
    time because of what he or she did - raped a child or\r\ncommitted another violent
    crime, for instance - it is wrong to deny them\r\ntreatment because of who they
    are. Would the state propose or the public\r\nsupport attempts to restrict access
    to infertility treatment to those of\r\nGreek heritage because they are Greek?\r\n\r\nBasing
    criteria for excluding individuals from treatment on behavior\r\nrather than identity
    assumes all prospective parents are fit, and places\r\nthe burden of proof to
    show otherwise on the Government.\r\n\r\nFor many people, children give their
    life a meaning and purpose they\r\ncannot envision getting elsewhere. This makes
    depriving people of their\r\nfreedom to have children as serious as hell: something
    to be done only\r\non the basis of evidence, and only as a last resort.\r\n\r\nNot
    only is discrimination against single women and lesbians morally\r\nwrong, the
    former unquestionably contravenes the Federal Sex\r\nDiscrimination Act. A little-reported
    Human Rights and Equal Opportunity\r\nCommission judgment handed down the day
    before last Christmas found the\r\nRoyal Womenâ\x80\x99s Hospital discriminated
    when it denied a woman access to\r\ndonor sperm because she was single, and awarded
    damages against the\r\nhospital. Melbourne IVF specialist Dr John McBain has just
    launched a\r\ncase in the Federal Court that, if successful, will strike down
    the\r\ndiscriminatory provisions of the ITA.\r\n\r\nHowever, single women may
    be able to gain access to donor sperm before\r\nMcBainâ\x80\x99s case is decided.
    That is because any hospital that denies them\r\ntreatment may - should the woman
    file a complaint - wind up in the\r\nFederal Court on a sex discrimination charge.\r\n\r\nThe
    federal sex discrimination commissioner, Susan Halliday, says: \\`\\`I\r\nam happy
    to receive complaints on this issue and, where there is\r\nlegitimate discrimination
    on the basis of marital status, I will accept\r\nthose complaints.â\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMy
    advice to any woman who fears she is running out of time and is\r\nwilling to
    call herself single is this: get ye to your nearest\r\ninfertility clinic with
    a copy of the HREOC judgment in your hot little\r\nhands! There are no guarantees,
    but you never know your luck in a big\r\ncity."
