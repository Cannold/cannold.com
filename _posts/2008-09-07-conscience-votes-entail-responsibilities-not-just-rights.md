    about\r\nwhether our Federal MPs think itâ\x80\x99s OK to spend our taxes on the
    cost of\r\nan abortion necessary to save a womanâ\x80\x99s life, or to evacuate

    abnormalities.\r\nIn 2006, Parliamentarians were allowed to exercise their moral
    judgment\r\non the acceptability of therapeutic cloning techniques to explore
    cures\r\nfor diseases like Parkinsonâ\x80\x99 disease and help for those confined

    truth is more complex. Yes, conscience votes are a noble idea, but\r\nunless parliamentarians
    understand both their rights and\r\nresponsibilities when they cast one, the results
    can be, well,\r\nunconscionable.\r\n\r\nHereâ\x80\x99s how itâ\x80\x99s meant
    to work. The right to follow the dictates of our\r\nconscience comes from the
    value of autonomy. Autonomy means self-rule,\r\nand an autonomous person is one
    who is free to live her life according\r\nto her own values.\r\n\r\nAutonomy matters
    to Australians. It is no exaggeration to say that in\r\nwestern countries like
    ours, it is the value that reigns supreme. Woven\r\ninto the fabric of a political
    system that has individual liberty as its\r\ncentral goal, it is also central
    to the common law view that a person is\r\nlegally responsible for her choices
    and so must be free to make them.\\\r\nConscience votes protect the autonomy of
    MPs. They allow them to follow\r\nthe dictates of their conscience by letting
    them vote for something they\r\nbelieve is right, and against what they think
    is wrong.\r\n\r\nBut not so fast.\r\n\r\nMPs, like all professionals, donâ\x80\x99t
    just have rights, they have\r\nresponsibilities. By fighting for an issue to be
    decided by conscience\r\nvote, or just accepting the privilege of casting one,
    they acknowledge\r\nhow important it is for them to live as they believe.\r\n\r\nIn
    what way is it fair or just then, for them to a cast a vote that\r\ndeprives others
    of the same freedom they enjoy with their vote: the\r\nfreedom to follow their
    conscience? Yet, this is what many do. Indeed,\r\nit is those who fight so hard
    for personal moral issues like abortion\r\nand stem cell research to be decided
    by conscience vote, that go on to\r\ncast their vote in such a way as to deny
    the importance of conscience in\r\nthe lives of others. They vote against legislation
    that would give women\r\nthe right to exercise their consciences on the abortion
    question, or\r\nthose with critical illness the freedom to decide their own fate.\r\n\r\nHypocrisy?
    Absolutely, and made all the worse by the fact that MPs are\r\nthe ones who are
    meant to be protecting the autonomy - and the rights of\r\nconscience - of their
    constituents, not undermining it. The job\r\ndescription in a liberal democratic
    country like ours is not to impose\r\ntheir values on us, but to legislate in
    ways that uphold the priniciple\r\nthat we, not they, know what is right for us.\r\n\r\nA
    few years ago mutual obligation was the moral concept of the month,\r\nand if
    this isnâ\x80\x99t a mutual obligation issue, I donâ\x80\x99t know what is. Yes,\r\nas
    members of our community, politicians have a right to live their\r\nlives according
