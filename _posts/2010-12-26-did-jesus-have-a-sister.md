    The program set out to find the historical person that Christians\r\nnow revere
    as Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nAt one point in a spell-binding narrative, we were told
    the names of all\r\nof Jesusâ\x80\x99s brothers, and some details of what had
    become of them. But\r\nwhether Jesus had sisters and how many, the narration continued\r\nbreezily,
    was something we could not know because all the references to\r\nsisters in the
    gospels were unclear. The existence of such women and\r\ntheir names had not been
    documented.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of world painstakingly documents facts about a well-known\r\nfigureâ\x80\x99s
    male relatives, but allows the female ones to be lost to\r\nhistory? Recalling
    my lower jaw from the floor, I took myself off to the\r\nlibrary to find out.\r\n\r\nThe
    explanation I came up with was as illuminating as it was depressing.\r\nTwo thousand
    years ago in the Middle East, a scribe would no more record\r\nthe names of a
    famous manâ\x80\x99s sister than a reporter today doing a profile\r\non a farmer
    would write down the names of his sheep. Women simply\r\nwerenâ\x80\x99t considered
    people back then. They were, like a manâ\x80\x99s flocks,\r\njust chattels.\r\n\r\nWhat
    would it have been like to be a girl at this time? Particularly a\r\nbright, inquisitive
    girl who admired her older brother and, just like\r\nhim, thirsted to play a role
    in resolving the fierce conflicts - over\r\nbeliefs, identity and territory -
    that were raging at the time?\r\n\r\nHow might a man like Jesus - whose actual
    name was most likely Joshua -\r\nhave replied to the predicament of such an intelligent
    and beloved\r\nsister? My intuition, and reading of the few sayings that scholars
    tend\r\nto agree Joshua actually uttered, is that he would have responded with\r\ncompassion.\r\n\r\nTo
    make this case, you have to know something about the world in which\r\nour hero
    - and perhaps our heroine - came of age. There, an individualâ\x80\x99s\r\nstanding
    and status among his fellows was entirely dependent on his\r\nrelationship with
    God. Human suffering was seen as proof of sin and the\r\nLordâ\x80\x99s punitive
    hand. To win Godâ\x80\x99s forgiveness, one must atone through\r\nsacrifice at
    the Temple in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nThe cost of an animal sacrifice, on top of the
    price to simply enter the\r\nTemple, was beyond the means of many Israelites.\r\n\r\nThe
    spoils of this spiritual monopoly flowed into the pockets of the\r\nhereditary
    Jewish elite who the Romans allowed to run the Temple any way\r\nthey saw fit
    as long as they were acquiescent on other matters of state.\r\n\r\nUnable to afford
    redemption, the poor remained â\x80\x9Cuncleanâ\x80\x9D - beyond the\r\nsight
    of God and man. The infirm suffered terribly, too, particularly\r\nwhen the sacrifices
    offered on their behalf by the Temple priests failed\r\nto bring about the desired
    cure for their leprosy or schizophrenia,\r\nproving them doubly cursed by God.\r\n\r\nLess
    well understood is that women, by virtue of their gender, were also\r\nquasi outcasts
    in ancient Israelite society. Their access to God - the\r\nkey to their status
    in the world - was entirely dependent on their\r\nrelationship with men. To be
    seen in Godâ\x80\x99s eyes, a woman had to be\r\nsomeoneâ\x80\x99s daughter, sister,
    mother or wife. This is why in the Bible,\r\nwidows and divorcees crop up as victims
    of harsh social circumstances\r\nagain and again, and mothers yearn so desperately
    for the social\r\ninsurance of a son, who can still win them blessings when the
    other men\r\nthey depend on are dead and gone.\r\n\r\nJoshua of Nazareth understood
    the plight of outcasts. â\x80\x9CThe first will be\r\nlast and the last first,â\x80\x9D
    he said. â\x80\x9CBlessed are the destitute, the\r\nreviled, those who weep, who
    suffer and are hungry,â\x80\x9D he insisted. While\r\nsome say that such calls
    for recognition and respect for societyâ\x80\x99s\r\nreviled did not encompass
    women, this seems doubtful when he often\r\nexplicitly included them.\r\n\r\nIn
    the sayings and parables most scholars agree can be attributed to\r\nJoshua, we
    find justice-seeking widows, coin-sweeping housewives and\r\nprudent bakers who
    know just how to leaven bread so that one loaf\r\nbecomes many.\r\n\r\nIn the
    gospel of Thomas, Joshua responds to Peterâ\x80\x99s scathing dismissal\r\nof
    disciple Mary Magdalene as â\x80\x9Cnot worthy of lifeâ\x80\x9D by insisting that
    he\r\nwill â\x80\x9Cguide her â\x80¦ for every female who makes herself male will
    enter\r\nheavenâ\x80\x99s kingdomâ\x80\x9D. Added to this is evidence that women
    comprised many,\r\nif not most, of Joshuaâ\x80\x99s followers. Perhaps among these
    dignity-seeking\r\nJewish women was one or more of Joshuaâ\x80\x99s sisters?\r\n\r\nThe
    truth is that weâ\x80\x99ll never know. When I realised so many years ago\r\nthat
    Joshuaâ\x80\x99s sisters had been cruelly written out of history, and that\r\nno
    matter how much I cared, I could not reinstate them, I felt useless.\r\nNone of
    the tools I had spent so many years acquiring as an academic\r\nscholar and general
    audience non-fiction writer were in any way equal to\r\nthe task. I was surplus
    to what these women required.\r\n\r\nI tried to forget the sisters. To abandon
    them to the dust of the\r\nunmarked past where Iâ\x80\x99d found them, but failed.
    To do so made me feel\r\ncomplicit in perpetuating what theyâ\x80\x99d already
    suffered - the terrible\r\npain of being forgotten.\r\n\r\nThere was only one
    thing left to do. Slowly, I learned the craft of\r\nfiction writing so I could
    tell these stories the only way they could be\r\ntold. By letting my imagination
    take wing."
