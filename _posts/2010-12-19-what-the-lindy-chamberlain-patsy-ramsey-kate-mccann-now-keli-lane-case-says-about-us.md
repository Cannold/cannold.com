    a passion for sport, and a healthy\r\nsocial lifeâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nI disagree
    that the â\x80\x9Cgreat disconnectâ\x80\x9D is between Laneâ\x80\x99s public persona\r\nand
    her sexual activity, repetitive pregnancies and the use of abortion\r\nand adoption
    as solutions.\r\n\r\nThe disconnect is between the contradictory and punitive
    judgments\r\nAustralians pass on womenâ\x80\x99s sexual and reproductive lives,
    and our\r\ndenial of the corrosive impact these verdicts - and the restrictive
    laws\r\nthat result - have on womenâ\x80\x99s self-esteem and their capacity to
    control\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\nThe moral panic over Lane is familiar. We saw it
    in the Azaria\r\nChamberlain, JonBenet Ramsey and Madeleine McCann cases. In each,
    the\r\nchildrenâ\x80\x99s mothers - Lindy, Patsy and Kate - were pilloried for
    crying\r\ntoo little or too much, for being manipulative or inscrutable. In each,\r\nmedia
    coverage painted the woman as deviant - a bad mother - and so\r\nculpable for
    her own tragedy. Such a strategy, says Booker prize-winning\r\nnovelist Anne Enright,
    is a â\x80\x9Cpotent form of magicâ\x80\x9D that calms anxieties\r\nthat our own
    children are at risk.\r\n\r\nThe coverage of Keli Lane also stereotypes her as
    a bad and unnatural\r\nwoman - sexually rapacious, frivolously social, hyper-ambitious.
    This\r\nallows us to cast her out, beyond our collective compassion and any need\r\nto
    hear in her story something painfully revelatory about us, in\r\nparticular about
    the conflicting messages Australian society is sending\r\nto its daughters - that
    they must be hot but not sluttish, sexually\r\nliberated but reproductively in
    control, maternally self-abnegating but\r\nhighly accomplished.\r\n\r\nLane appeared
    buffeted by such contradictions. She was terrified of\r\nlosing the esteem of
    friends and family as a â\x80\x9Cgolden girlâ\x80\x9D but worried -\r\nas she
    told a friend - that â\x80\x9Cthe only thing [she might really be] good\r\nat
    [was] being a mumâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nWhen pregnant, Lane seemed acutely aware of
    what Dr Susie Allanson, a\r\npsychologist who counsels women with problem pregnancies,
    calls the\r\nâ\x80\x9Chuge stigma around women becoming pregnant when they havenâ\x80\x99t
    planned\r\nto, embarking on single parenthood, having an abortion or choosing\r\nadoptionâ\x80\x9D.
    Certainly, the judge had to remind the jury during the trial\r\nthat there was
    no place for moral judgments about Laneâ\x80\x99s choice to adopt\r\nor have terminations
    (she aborted two pregnancies and tried to end a\r\nthird but was denied the service
    because of her gestation). In\r\ncorrespondence to the worker handling the adoption
    of her third child,\r\nLane said: â\x80\x9CSociety says that this is wrong â\x80¦
    that people who do this\r\nmust be mad, slutty or cruel.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nI want

    vulnerability to the contradictory demands on Australian women\r\nexcuses murder.\r\n\r\nInstead,
