    And Everything.*\r\n\r\nIn the tense hours between 7pm on Wednesday until Laborâ\x80\x99s
    caucus meeting\r\non Thursday morning, women were emoting on Twitter: â\x80\x9CMy
    little boys may\r\nwake up to a female prime minister. I could burst into tears.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nWhen
    Julia Gillard emerged as the nationâ\x80\x99s new leader, we had this:\r\nâ\x80\x9CDaughters
    of Australia: ring your mum and say thank you for the\r\npossibility of Julia.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nWhat
    does it really mean to have a female prime minister? What will\r\nchange for Australian
    women, men and the country as a whole. Nothing.\r\nAnd everything.\r\n\r\nNothing
    because women in power are no different to men. As Julia Baird\r\nwrote in her
    book on the subject, Australiaâ\x80\x99s female politicians\r\nâ\x80\x9Cbackstab
    .., pursue â\x80¦ personal ambitions and openly criticise â\x80¦ each\r\notherâ\x80\x9D
    in the same manner as men.\r\n\r\nDespite this, the anointing of a female prime
    minister - by a female\r\ngovernor-general no less - does have the power to rock
    our world.\r\n\r\nThe paltry representation, or absence, of women in roles that
    are\r\nvisible, valued and influential has a cancerous effect on female\r\nself-esteem.
    Young girls canâ\x80\x99t see it, so they donâ\x80\x99t dream it. Women,\r\nwho
    understand that there can only be two reasons for their invisibility\r\n- female
    inferiority of pervasive gender discrimination - feel angry or\r\ndepressed.\r\n\r\nBy
    proving wrong those who said there would not be a female prime\r\nminister in
    our lifetimes, the likes of Gillard kindle hope and incite\r\nrebellion. Less
    than an hour after Gillard was sworn in, female\r\njournalists began tweeting
    about the absence of women in senior\r\neditorial positions. Overheard in the
    newsroom: â\x80\x9CYes, but where are the\r\nfemale newspaper editors?â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nGillard
    may also have particular interest, empathy and insight into\r\ngender-based discrimination.
    Certainly, she has experienced sexism. As a\r\nstudent at Unley High she protested
    demands that girls stay after class\r\nto tidy up while the boys had a good time.
    â\x80\x9CAre you into womenâ\x80\x99s\r\nliberation, Julia?â\x80\x9D the teacher
    asked, to which Gillard replied\r\nscornfully, â\x80\x9CI donâ\x80\x99t need womenâ\x80\x99s
    liberation, I was born free.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nMy favourite aspect of Gillardâ\x80\x99s
    ascendancy is how she made her move.\r\nCharacterisations of the process as one
    in which she had to be dragged\r\nto the podium, or tapped by faction leaders
    to consider a challenge, are\r\nmistaken. Gillard made her own assessment of the
    terminal nature of\r\nRuddâ\x80\x99s leadership and began summoning key MPs on
    Wednesday afternoon to\r\ngauge support.\r\n\r\nThis may be Gillardâ\x80\x99s
    greatest gift to Australian women: the forthright\r\nway she goes about her business
    as a powerful person in her own right.\r\nBy doing this, she normalises women
    in power not as women but as people,\r\nwith all the quirks and complexities of
    men. This makes her one of us\r\nand her path one we might stride, too."
