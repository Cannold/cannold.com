    Mummy Wars. The debate that flies out of\r\nthe box like a bat out of hell every
    time some dry academic study\r\nappears about centre-based childcare. Behind all
    the shouting about\r\nsample size, confidence levels and expert bias is a shrillness
    that can\r\nonly come from women who feel accused of being â\x80\x9Cbadâ\x80\x9D
    mummies, or are\r\ndefending their status as â\x80\x9Cgoodâ\x80\x9D mummies.\r\n\r\nWe
    donâ\x80\x99t acknowledge it, but debates about education funding may be\r\nsimilar.
    Seemingly about funding figures drawn from Federal and State\r\nbudget papers
    and high-minded disagreements about the role of the market\r\nin education or
    education in democracy, the real source of the heat and\r\nlight is far more primal:
    our desperate desire to be seen as good\r\nparents. The proof is in the irrationality,
    wrong-headedness or sheer\r\nmartyred silliness of the responses made to educators,
    parents, scholars\r\nand politicians who speak about the undeniable - and worsening
    - funding\r\ninequities between public and private schools. Responses that demonise\r\nthose
    who speak out as dishonest, envious or (our personal favourite)\r\nunethical.\r\n\r\nSo,
    letâ\x80\x99s see how the facts stack up.\r\n\r\nThe most common response to complaints
    about the grossly unfair way the\r\nFeds fund schools is to insist that the public
    system is the\r\nresponsibility of the States. But what has this to do with the
    moral\r\nproblem that 70% of Federal Government funds go to support the 32% of\r\nour
    kids who attend private schools? After all, a wrong is a wrong, no\r\nmatter what
    gets done afterwards to right it. It is also unclear how\r\nadding in the state
    contribution undermines the fact that the public\r\nsystem is under-funded given
    the result of such mathematics still leaves\r\nsome private school students with
    62% more resources devoted to their\r\neducation than the average student in a
    public school. A financial\r\nadvantage - it must be noted - that the Federal
    government omits to take\r\naccount of when it doles out funds to schools.\\\r\n.
    \\\r\nQuestionable claims are also made by the â\x80\x9Cyes, but not usâ\x80\x9D
    brigade:\r\nvarious officialdom from the Catholic schools who - usually as warm-up\r\nfor
    yet another round of successful Federal alms-collecting - imply that\r\ntheir
    good work among the underprivileged entitles them to ever-larger\r\nshares of
    the Federal and State funding pie.\r\n\r\nWell, maybe, but a new report by Barbara
    Preston has found that while\r\n40% of students in government schools are from
    low income families, this\r\nfigure is only 25% in Catholic schools (a figure
    not dissimilar to the\r\n22% of kids from low income families in other private
    schools).\r\nAccording to Preston, the difference is even greater for those students\r\nin
    very low income families, roughly twice as many of whom can be found\r\nin government
    schools, as compared to Catholic or other private schools.\r\n\r\nAnd we mustnâ\x80\x99t
    forget the\r\nâ\x80\x9CI-work~~5-jobs-and-budget-carefully-and-live-in-a-shoe-box-in-middle-of-the-road-while-cleaning-toilets\"parental\r\nmartyrs.
    Terrified of any changes to government policy that would\r\nincrease fees, this
    group defends the existing carve-up of Federal funds\r\ndespite the fact that~~
    were the public system funded properly - such\r\nextreme sacrifice would be unnecessary.
    Worse, they ignore the fact that\r\neven if they are the winners in theâ\x80\x9Dwho
    is the best parent stakesâ\x80\x9C,\r\nallowing this victory to compromise the
    quality of education available\r\nin public schools does nothing more than punish
    the most disadvantaged\r\nkids for the supposed sins of their parents. We hope
    that the Australian\r\ndebate about education funding has not yet reached the
    stage where any\r\nparticipant truly believes that only the children ofâ\x80\x9Dgood\"
    parents merit\r\na decent education.\r\n\r\nAnd last, but not least, is the non-sensical
    claim that parents who pull\r\ntheir kids from the public system are doing it
    a favour, as taxpayers\r\ncouldnâ\x80\x99t afford the price tag of quality education
    for all Australian\r\nkids, anyway. The reality is that no supporter of public
    education has\r\never wanted or asked for relief from the cost of providing a
    first rate\r\neducation for our young. Frankly, we canâ\x80\x99t think of a better
    way to\r\nspend money. As well, we know that when the last middle class family\r\nfinally
    leaves the system, Australia will have become the first\r\ndemocracy to settle
    for a public education system that provides - in the\r\nwords of Prime Minister
    John Howard - a â\x80\x9Creasonable safety netâ\x80\x9D for the\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nSo
    where do we go from here? First we need to be frank - with ourselves\r\nand with
    others - about why the subject of school funding gets us so hot\r\nunder the collar.
    Perhaps just knowing that much of the passion,\r\ninvective and downright nastiness
    around this debate is driven by our\r\nvery human and understandable anxiety about
    what kind of parents we are\r\nwill help us all to calm down. Maybe then weâ\x80\x99ll
    be in a position to have\r\na reasoned and effective discussion about what - when
    it comes to\r\neducation- is really best for all Australian children. Even those\r\nwithout
    perfect parents.\r\n\r\nJane Caro is the co-author (with Chris Bonnor) of The
