    critical of\r\nothers\r\n\r\nThe message from Health Minister Tony Abbott remains
    unequivocal:\r\nKathleen Donnelly, the mother of his wrongly assumed son, Daniel\r\nOâ\x80\x99Connor,
    is a â\x80\x9Cniceâ\x80\x9D girl.\r\n\r\nAs the latest twist in the ongoing adoption
    reunion story broke on\r\nMonday night, Abbott made his continuing fondness for
    his old girlfriend\r\nclear, despite his newfound awareness that she was sexually
    involved\r\nwith other men during the years he believed they were having an\r\nexclusive
    affair.\r\n\r\nWhile reporters repeatedly invited him to dump on Donnelly, Abbott\r\nrefused
    to pass judgement about what he described as â\x80\x9Chot-blooded young\r\npeopleâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CWe
    were all pretty wild back then so I am not in the business of making\r\ncritical
    judgements. She is a great girl and this doesnâ\x80\x99t change any of\r\nthatâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nIndeed,
    in his interviews with the press last month, Abbott has\r\nsuggested that his
    â\x80\x9Ccallowâ\x80\x9D decision to go overseas during Donnellyâ\x80\x99s\r\npregnancy
    must also be understood in the context of his youthful\r\nimmaturity. Presumably,
    a similar explanation accounts for the coupleâ\x80\x99s\r\nfailure to use contraception
    throughout their years of intimate\r\ninvolvement.\r\n\r\nSuch sentiments should
    be music to the ears of the vast majority of\r\nAustralians who support a womanâ\x80\x99s
    right to choose. They imply that\r\nhaving recently tried to give parents access
    to their teenagerâ\x80\x99s medical\r\nrecords in order to stop their â\x80\x9Copen-slather
    sexual activityâ\x80\x9D, and to\r\nrestrict the access of women and couples to
    safe and affordable\r\nabortion, Tony Abbott has seen the error of his ways.\r\n\r\nHaving
    refused to judge or condemn Donnelly for past mistakes, or\r\nbehaviour inconsistent
    with his moral values, is Abbott finally prepared\r\nto recognise the arrogance
    of his past judgement of other woman and\r\ncouples who - like he and Donnelly
    - had sex and unintentionally wound\r\nup pregnant? To realise that like he and
    Donnelly, we are all nice\r\npeople doing our best to live what we see as moral
    lives but at times\r\nget waylaid by cloudy judgement, immaturity or sheer bad
    luck? That\r\neveryone deserves to have their behaviour and decisions interpreted
    in\r\nthe context of their limits, and the framework of their lives?\r\n\r\nIf
    Donnelly can violate Abbottâ\x80\x99s code of sexual morality but still be\r\njudged
    a nice girl, then why not the rest of us? If the definition of a\r\nnice girl
    (and boy, for that matter) is a person who does their best to\r\nlive well in
    a complex world where things donâ\x80\x99t always go to plan, donâ\x80\x99t\r\nwe
    all qualify?\r\n\r\nWhat remains unclear is whether Abbottâ\x80\x99s complex personal
    situation will\r\nlead him to question his rigid and long-held views of female
    sexuality\r\nand reproductive obligation. Remember, he comes from a family that\r\nDonnelly
    says froze her out the moment they discovered she was pregnant.\r\nWill Tony Abbottâ\x80\x99s
    intimate engagement with the real world, with all its\r\nshades of grey, collapse
    the nice girl/slut distinction that has driven\r\nhis agenda on sexuality and
    reproduction for so long?\r\n\r\nAccording to psychologist Dr Susie Allanson,
    a counsellor of 15 years at\r\nthe East Melbourne Fertility Control Clinic, the
    odds are regrettably\r\nslim. Over the years Allanson has counselled a number
    of women who are\r\nnot just morally opposed to abortion but have actively campaigned\r\nagainst
    it being safe and legal. Yet, when they have found themselves\r\nunhappily pregnant,
    they decide in favour of abortion.\r\n\r\nThe problem, says Allanson, is that
    while such women sympathise with\r\ntheir own situation and feel confident their
    case justifies an abortion,\r\nmost refuse to allow their experience translate
    to compassion for other\r\nwomen facing the same dilemma. Instead, these women
    prefer to see their\r\nexperience as unique and so no challenge to their abortion
    politics or\r\ntheir uncompromising judgement of all aborting women - except\r\nthemselves,
    of course - as murderers.\r\n\r\nHypocrisy? You bet. And the worry is that Abbott
    will fall victim to\r\nthis most universally despised moral failing, too. That
    instead of\r\nrecognising that the personal limits and situational complexity\r\ncharacterising
    his case precisely mirror the dilemmas others face on the\r\nsexual, contraceptive
    and unplanned pregnancy front, that heâ\x80\x99ll insist\r\non seeing them as
    one-off and one-of-a-kind. That rather than preserve\r\nthe freedom he and Kathleen
    had to make their own decisions - even\r\nmistakes - and to take responsibility
    for them, heâ\x80\x99ll continue to do all\r\nin his power to deny those caught
    in a similar bind the freedom to\r\nchoose with dignity, according to their own
    needs and values.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr Allanson, imposing oneâ\x80\x99s rigid
    views on others relieves\r\nthe stress of those who find the contemporary world
    chaotic.\r\nâ\x80\x9CMust-abating about others,â\x80\x9D says Allanson, â\x80\x9Cgives
    such people a sense\r\nof controlâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nTony Abbott has had control
    of his sexual and reproductive world and\r\nnow, as Health Minister in a government
    about to take control of both\r\nhouses of parliament, he is about to assume unprecedented
    control of\r\nours. The question is whether he will finally allow the evidence
    of his\r\nown experience to collapse his rigid views about how others should\r\nbehave
    when it comes to sex, contraception and decisions about unplanned\r\npregnancies.
    Or will his rigid views about nice girls and sluts live to\r\nsee - and to guide
    the nationâ\x80\x99s health policy - another day?"
