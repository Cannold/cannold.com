    dispassionate analysis, not prior commitments, loyalties or the hope\r\nof financial
    advantage. This impartiality gives credibility to their\r\nviews unavailable to
    those with known religious, corporate or political\r\ncommitments, or who stand
    to make money from opinion being shaped one\r\nway instead of another.\r\n\r\nThis
    may explain why some organizations choose scholarly sounding names\r\nlike â\x80\x9Ccentresâ\x80\x9D,
    â\x80\x9Cinstitutesâ\x80\x9D and \"think-tanks, The reality, however, is\r\nthat

    Sydney\r\nInstitute, Gerard Henderson does not always disclose, when he opines\r\nabout
    the Australian political scene, that he spent two years as John\r\nHowardâ\x80\x99s
    chief of staff.\r\n\r\nAcademic gloss is not the only quality sought by those
    seeking\r\ninfluence. A connection with the â\x80\x9Clittle guyâ\x80\x9D - community-based
    or\r\ngrass-roots activists - also lends credibility to messages the big end\r\nof
    town (corporate Australia, political parties or the churches) want us\r\nto hear.\r\n\r\n[According
    to\r\nSourcewatch](http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Institute_of_Public_Affairs#Front_Groups),\r\nThe
    Institute of Public Affairs contributed to the establishment of a\r\nnumber of
    front groups, including the Australian Environment Foundation,\r\nwhich campaigns
    for weaker environmental laws and Independent\r\nContractors of Australia, which
    campaigns for an end to workplace safety\r\nlaws and the deregulation of the labour
    market.\r\n\r\nSuch â\x80\x9Castroturfingâ\x80\x9D (the creation or nurture of
    individuals or groups\r\nthat falsely inflate â\x80\x9Cpublicâ\x80\x9D opinion)
    may be behind the newfound\r\npopularity amongst longstanding pro-life organizations
    and activists of\r\nre-badging themselves for every campaign they undertake against
    abortion\r\nand embryonic stem cell research. Well-known anti-choice activists
    and\r\nseveral women with links to Opus Dei recently became directors of\r\nWomenâ\x80\x99s
    Forum Australia, which asserts feminist grounds for opposing the\r\ndrug regulatorâ\x80\x99s
    control over RU486, transparent advertising\r\nrequirements for pregnancy counselling
    organizations and stem cell\r\nresearch. The Coalition Against the Decriminalisation
    of Abortion seems\r\nlike a new pro-life grass roots organisation, but shares
    a mailing\r\naddress with Catch the Fire Ministries. In its first year of operation,\r\nCadoa
    found around $34,000 to fund anti-decriminalisation newspaper ads.\r\n\r\nWhat
    can be done? The code of ethics binding journalists requires them\r\nto be honest,
    to refrain from suppressing or distorting relevant facts,\r\nto refuse to allow
    personal interest, or any belief, commitment,\r\npayment, gift or benefit to undermine
    their independence and to disclose\r\nconflicts of interest that affect - or could
    be seen to affect - their\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the time has come for
    other media participants to be asked to\r\nconform to similar ethical standards.
    Anyone who really wishes to\r\nconduct their dealings transparently shouldnâ\x80\x99t
    find it too hard to work\r\nout what disclosures are required.\r\n\r\nBeyond this,
    the best the public and decision-makers can do is to\r\napproach the credentials
    and disclosures offered by media players with\r\nskepticism. They may be complete,
    accurate and relevant. Then again,\r\nthey may not."
