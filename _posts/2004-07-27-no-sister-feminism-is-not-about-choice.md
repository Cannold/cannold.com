    the good old F-word. For a while, things were looking grim. All that\r\ntalk about
    irrelevance, betrayal of the young, even death. No one but\r\nthe humourless hirsute
    holed up in the hallowed halls of\r\nhigher-education had a good word to say about
    her.\r\n\r\nNow our dear old F-word is back, though the revolutionary being returned\r\nto
    us as a topic of decent conversation is not the gal we knew. Sheâ\x80\x99s a\r\nkindler,
    gentler revolutionary with fewer enemies than a nun. Sheâ\x80\x99s the\r\nNew
    Feminism, a social movement that no longer causes discomfort or\r\ndivision by
    identifying female oppression or fighting to change the way\r\nthe world is organised.
    The New Feminism speaks only in muted tones\r\nabout how all womenâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9Cchoicesâ\x80\x9D
    must be respected.\r\n\r\nThe problem with New Feminism is that social movements
    must actually\r\nstand for something. Barracking for one vision of the good is
    to be\r\nopposed to its opposite. For something to be right, fair or good,\r\nsomething
    else must (at least in theory and arguably in practice) be\r\nwrong, unfair or
    bad. Second wave feminists werenâ\x80\x99t backwards about\r\ncoming forward with
    their views that attitudes and practices when it\r\ncame to paid work and the
    care of children discriminated and oppressed\r\nwomen and were therefore wrong.
    It was on the basis of these unambiguous\r\nmoral assertions that their demands
    for change were founded. It was also\r\non this basis that opposition formed amongst
    those who disagreed with\r\nfeminist descriptions of the problem, the movementâ\x80\x99s
    preferred\r\nsolutions, or both.\r\n\r\nChoice, as the forgoing should make clear,
    didnâ\x80\x99t enter it. This is not\r\nto say that choice is not a legitimate
    part of what feminism is about in\r\nsome instances. In particular, when itâ\x80\x99s
    possible for everyone to have\r\nit regardless of their education level or financial
    resources, and when\r\nmaking one choice available to one person doesnâ\x80\x99t
    denigrate or undermine\r\nthe legitimacy of the choices made another. The freedom
    to choose\r\nabortion is a good example. It can be argued for without implying
    that\r\nwomen who go forward with an unplanned pregnancy, or choose motherhood\r\nat
    any other point in their lives, are doing the wrong thing.\r\n\r\nWould that it
    were always so easy. Feminists also argued that women and\r\nmen should share
    the work of earning and of caring. They have claimed\r\nthat social attitudes,
    policies and practices that make it hard for\r\nwomen to undertake paid work and
    for men to care are oppressive, and\r\nought to be changed. Note such a claim
    is not about preference. Itâ\x80\x99s\r\ndoesnâ\x80\x99t say â\x80\x9CI donâ\x80\x99t
    like it, so you should change it.â\x80\x9D Rather it is an\r\nassertion that the
    way we currently do things is morally wrong, and that\r\ndoing the right thing
    requires us to change.\r\n\r\nWhat kinds of reasons did feminists give in support
    of their claim that\r\nchange was required? They said it was only fair that women
    have the same\r\neducational and job opportunities as men, and be paid the same
    for the\r\nsame work. They also claimed that children were harmed by menâ\x80\x99s
    absence\r\nfrom the home (a concern now shared by the menâ\x80\x99s movement).\r\n\r\nSuch
    claims were never morally innocuous nor, consequently, reducible to\r\nmatters
    of â\x80\x9Cchoice.â\x80\x9D If discrimination against women was unjust, than\r\nthose
    who colluded or supported such discrimination were guilty of\r\nimmoral behaviour.
    If children suffered as a consequence of the way\r\nlabour was organised, than
    everyone who supported such arrangements -\r\nfrom society, to employers, to parents
    who lived that way when they had\r\nthe ability to do otherwise - stood condemned.
    â\x80\x9CChoiceâ\x80\x9D never entered\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe old F-word was also fond
    of exposing the classist nature of choice.\r\nIt was the feminists that everyone
    loved-to-hate who pointed out that\r\nunder-the-garden-tree ponderings of the
    â\x80\x9Cshould I return to work, or\r\nshould I stay at home?â\x80\x9D variety
    were available only to sisters whose\r\nhusbands were loaded. For the rest of
    us (as well as for the vast\r\nmajority of fathers who not only lack a decently-paid
    spouse but access\r\nto even the minimal parental-leave and part-time work options
    enjoyed by\r\nsome mothers) the â\x80\x9Cchoiceâ\x80\x9D is academic, given the
    causal pairing of the\r\nstay-at-home option with the go-to-the-poorhouse one.
    Seen in this\r\nlight, itâ\x80\x99s clear that respect for individual choice offers
    few answers\r\nto most women and men struggling to solve the work/life crisis.\r\n\r\nWeâ\x80\x99d
    all like to get along famously and, on a personal level, we can. At\r\nthe risk
    of recycling the oldest clichÃ© in the book, one of my best\r\nfriends is a stay-at-home
    mum. With the exception of the time we tried\r\nto discuss the White Wings advert
    (the one in which a school-girl\r\nextolling her motherâ\x80\x99s philosophy of
    home-backing everything is told by\r\nher friend that her own mother doesnâ\x80\x99t
    do that because sheâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9Cgot a\r\nlife.â\x80\x9D), thereâ\x80\x99s
    never been a cross word between us. Politically,\r\nhowever, such internecine
    peace - between conservative and revolutionary\r\nwomen; between the unselfconsciously
    wealthy and the rest - is\r\nimpossible. Impossible, that is, without real feminists
    neutering our\r\nvision of a better world for women so radically that it renders
    us\r\nlittle more, and little better, than patriarchs without balls.\r\n\r\nChange
    requires a moral vision of the world as it should be; a vision\r\nthat is, by
    definition, exclusionary. To state oneâ\x80\x99s dreams is to\r\nimplicitly criticise
    and negate the opposing vision of others.\r\n\r\nAh politics, itâ\x80\x99s a bitch."
