    previous generation. While the impetus for these\r\nflare-ups varies, the parameters
    and content of the debate never change.\r\n\r\nThe same old questions about women,
    work and the care of children are\r\nbeing asked and answered by the same old
    people: ageing baby-boom\r\njournalists and academics who raised their young families
    in the 1970s\r\nand â\x80\x9880s on the basis of advice they received from the
    child-development\r\n\\`\\`expertsâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 of the â\x80\x9950s.\r\n\r\nThese
    child-care dinosaurs share a number of assumptions and values.\r\nThey assume
    that the care middle-class mothers give their kids is the\r\n\\`\\`gold standardâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99
    and thus all middle-class mothers should provide all\r\nof the care for their
    children, especially those under five. Because\r\nmothers \\`\\`shouldâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99
    be caring for their children, dinosaur thinking\r\nproceeds, they are the ones
    that \\`\\`leave themâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99 in child care and are\r\nconsequently
    responsible for the \\`\\`consequencesâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nThese assumptions
    and values lead the dinosaurs to keep asking the same\r\nquestions theyâ\x80\x99ve
    been asking since the late 1960s: should women/mothers\r\nwork?\r\n\r\nOf course,
    back in the 21st century, few members of Gen X and Gen Y -\r\nthose currently
    considering parenthood or raising young children - can\r\nrelate to these assumptions
    and values, or the questions they generate.\r\nAs recent large-scale, longitudinal
    studies of Australian women and my\r\nown research demonstrate, younger women
    assume the role of work in their\r\nlife and value paid employment as an important
    source of identity and\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with their baby-boomer
    predecessors, increasing numbers of\r\nyoung men are comfortable with womenâ\x80\x99s
    educational achievements and\r\nsupportive of their career aspirations. For most
    of them, the question\r\n\\`\\`should women/mothers work?â\x80\x99â\x80\x99 is
    laughable and the assumption that\r\nonly a childâ\x80\x99s mother is capable
    of providing excellent care is dubious.\r\n\r\nIndeed, recent evidence suggests
    a considerable number of young men,\r\npossibly up to a third, want to be and
    believe they should be active\r\nfathers: sharing the work of breadwinning and
    the hands-on work of\r\ncaring for children with their partners. In such relationships,
    both\r\nparents make, and share responsibility for, decisions to share the care\r\nof
    their children with one another and with granny and/or a paid carer.\r\n\r\nBecause
    many Gen Xers and Yers assume both parents do and should engage\r\nin paid employment
    and share responsibility for child care, the\r\nquestions theyâ\x80\x99d like
    to see asked and answered revolve around the\r\nproper division of work and care
    responsibilities. How should parents\r\ndivide these tasks between themselves?
    What role should the state and/or\r\nemployers play in sharing the responsibility
    for children, either\r\ndirectly or through policies and practices that help parents
    balance\r\nwork and family responsibilities?\r\n\r\nSuch debates are not without
    precedent. Indeed, countries (such as Swede\r\nand the GDR) that assume - rather
    than contest - womenâ\x80\x99s involvement in\r\npaid employment ask them regularly,
    although the answers vary\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\nWhile the child-care dinosaurs
    have and will continue to strangle such\r\ndebates, their reign is nearly over.
    The boomers, those propagating the\r\ncurrent paradigm and those buying into it,
    are ageing. In seven to 10\r\nyears, the last of their kids will have fled the
    nest and concerns about\r\nsuperannuation, aged-care beds and pensioner concessions
    will be\r\nuppermost in their minds.\r\n\r\nIt is simply inconceivable that a
    generation on the cusp of retirement,\r\nclutching dog-eared copies of W.D.Winnicottâ\x80\x99s
    1957 tome on child\r\ndevelopment, will continue to muster authority in debates
    about the\r\nhaving and raising of young children. Not just because their ideologies\r\nare
    so far past their use-by date, but because many in the coming\r\ngeneration of
    prospective and actual parents will have spent a fair bit\r\nof their childhood
    in centre-based care or the care of someone other\r\nthan their mothers. They
    simply wonâ\x80\x99t be vulnerable in the same way as\r\nwere their parents to
    dinosaur scare-mongering about the damage caused\r\nto kids by non-maternal care.\r\n\r\nMy
    advice to those of the current generation and the next, who have been\r\nalternately
    aggravated and bored by the latest rounds of the child-care\r\n\\`\\`debateâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99,
    is to hang in there: we are listening to the death throes\r\nof the child-care
    dinosaurs.\r\n\r\nDonâ\x80\x99t expect it to be quick or quiet. Surely the dying
    of the giant\r\nlizards rarely was. But be prepared with questions, ideas and
    solutions\r\nfor when all has finally gone quiet. The debate has ossified for
    far too\r\nlong; weâ\x80\x99ve got a lot of work to do."
