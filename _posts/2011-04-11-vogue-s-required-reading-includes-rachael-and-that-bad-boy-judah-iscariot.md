title: Vogue's Required Reading Includes Rachael (and that bad boy Judah Iscariot)
---
What if Jesus of Nazareth had a sister? And what is she were a bright girl forced by virtue of her gender into a life of servitude? And what if she hooked up with the wrong bloke? Many years ago Leslie Cannold a watched a BBC documentary about Jesus which arguee that he may have had a sister (and not a brother called Brian). *The Book of Rachael* (Text Publishing, $32.95) took seven years to write and imagines that Rachael siter of “Joshua of Nazareth” falls in love with bad boy “Judah of Iscariot”.
