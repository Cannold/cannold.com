    comments\r\non the unfettered capacity of the nationâ\x80\x99s religious institutions
    to\r\npractise gender discrimination were the most interesting - and\r\ncontentious
    - of her tenure.\r\n\r\nDespite the generous support of such institutions by the
    Australian\r\nGovernment through tax exemptions and funding for religious schools,
    the\r\ninstitutional and liturgical practices of the church show blithe\r\ndisregard
    for federal laws that prohibit the unfair treatment of\r\nAustralian women on
    the basis of their gender, marital or pregnancy\r\nstatus. â\x80\x9CItâ\x80\x99s
    a huge law-free zone,â\x80\x9D said Goward.\r\n\r\nHer contrasting of the nationâ\x80\x99s
    intolerance of practices that perpetuate\r\ninequality between the races, but
    laissez-faire attitude to parallel\r\nones that allow gender inequity, is both
    acute and timely. Most\r\nAustralians would agree that a religion that claimed
    that race was a\r\nlegitimate ground for denying a congregant a leadership role
    in the\r\nchurch, or for physically segregating him from others during services\r\nwas
    immoral, and should be unlawful.\r\n\r\nYet, both victims of race and gender discrimination
    suffer attenuated\r\naspirations and opportunities. Why should the law give a
    privilege to\r\nthe rights of believers to be free of racial discrimination, but
    cry\r\nâ\x80\x9Creligious toleranceâ\x80\x9D whenever complaints of gender discrimination
    are\r\nmade? How can a nation that allows the nationâ\x80\x99s churches to deny
    equal\r\nopportunity to women assert that gender equity is a fundamental Aussie\r\nvalue?\r\n\r\nOne
    reason Australian lawmakers might see sexism, but not racism, as a\r\nlesser evil
    than the restriction of religious freedom is the integral\r\nrole sexism plays
    in the Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Islam and\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\nRace was
    a potent concept before and around the time of Jesus, but it\r\nwas a voluntary
    category defined by the individualâ\x80\x99s choice of faith.\r\nThe contemporary
    understanding of race - as a set of inalterable and\r\nunchosen physical characteristics
    - does not feature in the Torah or the\r\nGospels as a category that either inherently
    limits or expands an\r\nindividualâ\x80\x99s access to God. In practical terms,
    this means that not only\r\ndoes the enforcement of legal prohibitions on racism
    have little\r\npractical impact on the churchâ\x80\x99s teachings, but that the
    scriptures\r\noffer little to defend those who discriminate on grounds of race.\r\n\r\nSadly,
    this is not the case for gender. While the fictional nature of\r\nmuch of Dan
    Brownâ\x80\x99s The Da Vinci Code is beyond question, the general\r\nthesis about
    the determination of the first Christians to suppress the\r\nfeminine is correct.\r\n\r\nPaul,
    in particular, seemed determined to ignore Jesusâ\x80\x99s more\r\ngender-egalitarian
    bent and to pursue gentile converts to the new sect\r\nby impressing them with
    the modesty of Christian women. The ancient\r\nHebrews bequeathed to the first
    Christians (most of whom came from pious\r\nJewish backgrounds) a view of women
    as unclean creatures with no\r\nindependent standing in the eyes of God. For women
    to be seen by God -\r\nthe only way in such cultures for her to acquire social
    status - they\r\nmust maintain dutiful familial relationships with men: fathers,\r\nbrothers,
    husbands. The spinsters, widows and divorcees who lacked such\r\nrelationships,
    or who, once engaged in them, failed to deliver virginity\r\nand later sons, risked
    being cast out from the community.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence that such antiquated
    views of women continue to\r\ninfluence the contemporary practices of some Jewish,
    Christian and\r\nMuslim congregations. Whether itâ\x80\x99s Orthodox Jews daily
    thanking God for\r\nnot making them women, Muslim schools refusing to hire unmarried
    women,\r\nor Christian ones dismissing women when they became pregnant, Australian\r\nwomen
    of faith are subject to treatment that reflects limited views\r\nabout their full
    humanity and denies them opportunities for no other\r\nreason than that they are
    female.\r\n\r\nReligious leaders are no amateurs when it comes to defending male\r\nprivilege
    in the liturgy and hierarchy. â\x80\x9COur holy books command us to\r\ntreat women
    this way,â\x80\x9D they protest, conveniently forgetting the\r\nredundancy of
    scriptural commandments to stone adulterers, or forcibly\r\nmarry rapists to their
    victims. Alternatively, they argue that if women\r\nwerenâ\x80\x99t content with
    second-class citizenship, theyâ\x80\x99d have fled the\r\nchurches long ago.\r\n\r\nWould
    that it were so simple. As the recent expose on ABCâ\x80\x99s Four Corners\r\nmade
    clear, the fundamentalist Exclusive Brethren exact high costs -\r\nsuch as life-long
    separation from spouses and children - from those who\r\nexit. It is also unclear
    whether a guarantee of more realistic exit\r\nrights is a just response to unlawful
    discrimination by religious\r\norders.\r\n\r\nWould we deem â\x80\x9Clump it or
    leaveâ\x80\x9D an acceptable response to Aboriginal\r\nAustralians who complained
    that their church was denying them leadership\r\npositions and demanding they
    sit in pews at the back? Or would we feel\r\nthat Aborigines have a right to membership
    in a church free of\r\ninstitutionalised racism.\r\n\r\nSexism is just as eviscerating
    to the dignity, self-esteem, aspirations\r\nand opportunities of women as racism
    is to people of colour. It was the\r\nrecognition of this fact that led to the
