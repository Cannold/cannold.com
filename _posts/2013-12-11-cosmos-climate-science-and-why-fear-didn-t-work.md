  content: "With some exceptions, the strategy of the environment movement has been
    to provoke fear: fear for the quality of our own lives and over the survival of
    our grandchildren.\r\n\r\nIt is questionable whether that is working. Some commentators,
    such as Guardian journalist Anne Kapf  say the fear, or rather caring too much
    about about the fate of our planet, has caused many to switch off to the dangers.\r\n\r\nThe
    problem is so enormous, the consequences of failing to act so profound, and yet
    as a global community we seem unable to take the decisive action required to save
    our own necks.\r\n\r\nAgainst this background, the Warsaw Climate Change Conference
    ended last week not with a whimper but a long sustained raspberry. No agreement
    was reached, or even sought. The best the gathering hoped for in its stated goals
    was a â\x80\x9Cviable roadmap to an agreementâ\x80\x9D to be signed off on in
    2015.\r\n\r\nIn the event, delegates failed to get even that. Poor countries and
    green groups walked out in protest at what they claimed were bad faith blocking
    tactics by rich industrialised countries. The Philippines delegate went on hunger
    strike in a desperate attempt to convince the delegates to stop the climate â\x80\x9Cmadnessâ\x80\x9D
    that resulted in Super Typhoon Haiyan wreaking havoc on his homeland.\r\n\r\nAustralia,
    which refused to send representation at a minister-level, was castigated by green
    groups that awarded us three â\x80\x9Cfossil of the dayâ\x80\x9D awards for the
    federal governmentâ\x80\x99s perceived reluctance to take climate change seriously.\r\n\r\nAcademics
    are perplexed by the lack of engagement. The scientific community finds its carefully
    documented facts and informed speculation carry no special weight. Rather scientists
    are regularly disrespected by high profile non-scientist climate deniers. Itâ\x80\x99s
    no wonder we despair.\r\n\r\nBut what if our advocacy focus has been on the wrong
    side of the motivational continuum? What if a failure to understand the frightening
    implications of climate change is not whatâ\x80\x99s behind the resistance of
    key decision-makers? What if the real problem is fear and fearâ\x80\x99s partners
    in crime, a lack of hope that we can change anything.\r\n\r\nIf fear is the problem,
    the solution is hope and its bedfellow, empowerment. But how can such hope be
    kindled, and what role should the scientific community play?\r\n\r\nThe answer
    is complex and involves the art of behavioural change. Marketers know all about
    what makes humans tick, and how to influence them. Since the 1970s the growing
    body of marketing knowledge has been adapted and built on by those hoping to achieve
    widespread social change. There are some great resources on how such knowledge
    can and should be deployed to solve problems such climate change and living sustainably.
    Unileverâ\x80\x99s 5 Levers for Change video is a good example.\r\n\r\nThat said,
    the job of scientists is not to morph into behavioural change experts, but to
    acknowledge the key role such experts will have in efforts to effect influence
    the climate debate.\r\n\r\nAny solution must be come from an holistic approach,
    not with the failed traditional linear and analytical models.\r\n\r\nThe key take-home
    for the scientific community is that its work in alerting those in the community
    receptive to the fear message is done. Those who can be mobilised in this fashion
    are alert, alarmed and advocating change â\x80\x93 or at least living more sustainably
    themselves.\r\n\r\nThe task ahead is to continue to mobilise key decision-makers
    through an influence strategy based on hope and empowerment. Scientists must understand
    what will move key decision-makers to act quickly and decisively in defence of
    the planet, and to play their role in the holistic and flexible strategic communication
    effort required in the crucial months and years ahead."
