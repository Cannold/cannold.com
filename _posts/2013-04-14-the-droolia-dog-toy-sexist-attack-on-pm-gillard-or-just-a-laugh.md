In the wake of Leslie's contribution to this [Daily Telegraph](http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/pets-doll-droolia-julia-being-sold-in-adelaide/story-fncvk70o-1226616272712) piece on the Droolia toy, Leslie spoke to several 2UE presenters throughout the day - among them Sara and Dicko on the morning show, on the double-bind faced by women leaders across the globe. 

The piece also appeared in [The Adelaide Advertiser](http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/pets-doll-droolia-julia-being-sold-in-adelaide/story-fncz7kyc-1226616272712).
