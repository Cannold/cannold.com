    \r\n\r\nLeslie Cannold's Book Notes music playlist for her debut novel, [The Book
    of Rachael](http://cannold.com/articles/article/the-book-of-rachael/):\r\n\r\nWhat
    a great idea! I loved concocting this play list, and even more so when my intuitive
    interpretation of the project â\x80\x93 to come up with a songlist that gave expression
    to the emotional tenor of key scenes in The Book of Rachael â\x80\x93 was a bit
    different to what other writers participating in the Largehearted Boy Playlist
    project have done.\r\n\r\nThe Book of Rachael imagines the life of Jesus's sister:
    a woman who may or may not have existed and whose name and life story has been
    forever lost to history. My quest in writing the book was to give an answer to
    the question, \"what kind of world records all of what's known about a famous
    man's brothers, yet fails to record even the names of his sisters?\" In answering
    the question I allow the mythical sisters of Joshua of Nazareth - Rachael and
    her older sister Shona - to roam through the historicized landscape of the gospels,
    a terrain that reveals much about the social, religious and political struggles
    of the Jewish people. Rachael is a precocious and determined child who, much like
    the imaginary sister of Shakespeare postulated by Virginia Woolf, is as talented
    and as her older brother but because of the values the time and into which she
    was born, must struggle for recognition, and a place in history.\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael
    Helps Birth a Passover Lamb\r\n\"Pushover\" â\x80\x93 Lisa Miller \r\nPushover
    is all about the search for recognition and belonging, and what's required to
    obtain it. Recognition and acceptance are important themes in The Book of Rachael.
    The insight in the song â\x80\x93 about the need to avoid being a pushover and
    to walk away from toxic relationships â\x80\x93 is key to how the talented and
    ambitious Rachael resolves her quest to gain her mother Miriame's recognition
    and love.\r\n\r\n\r\nShona's Womanhood Ceremony \r\n\"Nadia\" â\x80\x93 Nitin
    Sawhey\r\nAnita Diamante's The Red Tent was one of the literary inspirations for
    The Book of Rachael. While Diamante's take on the lives of women in biblical times
    has a more \"separate but equal\" flavour than my novel, Shona's womanhood ceremony
    is a Diamante moment. In it, I imagine a more sacred and special ritual than what
    is on offer to contemporary girls to mark their transition to womanhood.\r\n\r\nNadia
    seems the perfect backing track to this and many of the early events in The Book
    of Rachael. The song has been covered many times, but the juxtaposition of ancient
    melodies and female vocal tones in this version, deliciously combined with a modern
    backbeat, is my favourite. It is also the most appropriate, as this ancient and
    modern musical combination models the literary combination I'm trying to offer
    readers in The Book of Rachael: a timeless story of the human striving for belonging
    and recognition set in a particular place and time â\x80\x93 2000 years ago in
    the middle-east, at a time of crisis for a colonized people.\r\n\r\n\r\nShona's
    Tragedy & Judgment\r\n\"Unravel\" - Bjork\r\nBjork is a musical genius whose compositions
    make you think and feel in equal and intense parts. What happens to Shona is the
    inciting incident to Rachael's journey and Bjork seems the only sensible backing
    choice to the conflict and tragedy it sets up for both young women.\r\n\r\n\r\nEntering
    Jerusalem\r\n\"The Feeling Begins\" â\x80\x93 Peter Gabriel\r\nReaders tell me
    they can clearly see many of the scenes in The Book of Rachael play out in their
    heads. In particular, they see the sacred pilgrimages the men of Galilee were
    required to make three times a year to Jerusalem. If songs can be middle-eastern
    in flavor and panoramic in feel, this is one.\r\n\r\n\r\nJudah and Rachael in
    the Sukkoh Tent\r\n\"Closer â\x80\x93 Kings of Leon\"\r\nThe romance between Rachael
    and Judah of Iscarriot is an important part of Rachael's journey. It certainly
    has moved readers. Not just because the sex between them is good, but because
    the relationship enables the fullness of Judah's complex character to be revealed
    in a way far more satisfying than is attempted in the 30 pieces of silver explanation
    for the betrayal offered in some of the gospels.\r\n\r\nCloser is one of the most
    moving songs ever written. If you haven't seen Kings of Leon play it live chase
    it up on YouTube. It is the only song I can imagine backing the first time Rachael
    and Judah engage in the tender, savage coupling of two people in love.\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael,
    Joshua & Judah Storm the Temple\r\n\"Thoughts of a Dying Atheist\" - Muse\r\nEnergy,
    chaos, passion â\x80\x93 this track has all that, as does this key turning point
    in the novel.\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Learns of Judah's Betrayal\r\n\"Time\" â\x80\x93
    Hans Zimmer\r\nMy musician friend loves this piece, the developing imperfection
    of the C major 7th chord at its centre matches the heartbreaking flaw in Judah's
    beautiful nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nJudah and Rachael Mourn & Fight\r\nThis is the moment
    when it all ends: Joshua and Judah's friendship, Rachael and Joshua's sibling
    relationship and the deep & sensuous love between Rachael and Judah. This song
    says \"this is the end\" in the language of music as clearly as it is had lyrics
    that repeated just this phrase.\r\n\r\n\r\nRachael Comes to Terms with What Was
    and Will Be in Antioch\r\n\"Sigur 3 (untitled)\" â\x80\x93 Sigur Ros\r\nThe composition
    of this song speaks volumes about recovery from tragedy and the courage and ingenuity
    it takes to be born again. Rachael is re-born in the novel's epilogue, not just
    because she survives and finds a place for some of her talents to flourish, but
    through our efforts in reading her story and - by so doing â\x80\x93 rescuing
    her from the dustbin of history."
