    she had with three boys at a party after too much drink: â\x80\x9CIt\r\nfelt really
    good at the time but afterwards I felt cheated and used.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThe Matthew
    Johns affair is the last in a long line of incidents and\r\ndevelopments - including
    burlesque, pole dancing and lipstick parties -\r\nto have sparked welcome debate
    about power, consent, vulnerability and\r\nresponsibility in contemporary relationships.\r\n\r\nBut
    regret - what provokes it and what it reveals - has been left to one\r\nside.
    Either that, or it is deployed by authoritarian forces (radical\r\nfeminists and
    conservative Christians) as proof that women are\r\nvulnerable victims when it
    comes to sex, sexuality and relationships,\r\nwho need as much protection from
    others as they do from themselves.\r\n\r\nConsent and regret are different. You
    canâ\x80\x99t regret someone forcing you\r\nto do something because regret suggests
    responsibility and you werenâ\x80\x99t\r\nin control in the first place. You can
    consent to something, even drive\r\nit, yet realise while itâ\x80\x99s happening
    youâ\x80\x99ve bitten off more than you can\r\nchew. Or, as the West Australian
    teenager did, feel good about something\r\nat the time but repent at leisure.\r\n\r\nHow
    this happens speaks of the affinity between regret and our personal\r\nand collective
    ethics. Sometimes regret comes from within, after weâ\x80\x99ve\r\nsobered up
    and emotions have had time to settle. Sometimes, other people\r\ncompel our regret.
    Schoolyard and office gossips can cause us to rue not\r\nwhat we actually did
    but what they are making sure is the resulting\r\ndamage to our reputation. In
    the rigid and unforgiving social world of\r\nadolescent girls and young women,
    public contrition and lots of tears\r\n(for sleeping with another girlâ\x80\x99s
    boyfriend, for agreeing to group sex)\r\nmay be the only route to absolution and
    a return to the fold.\r\n\r\nThe upshot of all this is that regret is inevitable
    - a consequence of\r\nmistakes we are big enough to own and the policing of moral
    boundaries\r\nby others.\r\n\r\nThat this is the case means the young, who donâ\x80\x99t
    actually know as much\r\nas they think and run in packs, are at particular risk
    of regret. I try\r\nto teach my teenagers to respect other people and the law,
    and to\r\nrequire others to do the same. I welcome the public health messages
    that\r\nfacilitate good decision making by helping them see the consequences of\r\nchoices
    made under the influence. But Iâ\x80\x99m not foolish enough to think\r\nthis
    will guarantee their journey to adulthood is free of risks,\r\nmistakes and regret.\r\n\r\nMy
    children happen to be boys but unless we want to return to the days\r\nof the
    sexual double standard, chaperones, backyard abortion and\r\nillegitimate children
    - social stigmas and restrictions that may have\r\nkept women safer but only by
    keeping them in their place - we must\r\naccept this is true of girls, too. The
    sexual and feminist revolutions\r\nthat are challenging rules that have governed
    female behaviour for\r\nthousands of years are only 50 years old. Missteps and
    uncertainty are\r\ninevitable. We need to hold our nerve.\r\n\r\nWe must let girls
    know that we donâ\x80\x99t see them as vulnerable victims in\r\nneed of protection
    but as women-in-the-making who are as capable as boys\r\nof owning their choices
    and, when they stumble, righting themselves.\r\n\r\nBeing free doesnâ\x80\x99t
    make you wise, it doesnâ\x80\x99t keep you safe and it wonâ\x80\x99t\r\ninure
    you from regret. It just makes you free. The rest is in our hands."
