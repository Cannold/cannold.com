    mothers from paid work?\r\n\r\nTHIS is how I remember a conversation last week
    between me and two other\r\nmothers of grade 1 children:\r\n\r\nMother 1: Does
    your child sleep at night?\r\n\r\nMe: Yes, why? Doesnâ\x80\x99t yours?\r\n\r\nMother
    1: She gets up two or three times a night.\r\n\r\nMe: I think itâ\x80\x99s because
    I did some â\x80\x9Ccontrolled comfortâ\x80\x9D with him when\r\nhe was little;
    it teaches them how to put themselves back to sleep when\r\nthey wake up.\r\n\r\nMother
    2: I think â\x80\x9Ccontrolled comfortâ\x80\x9D is barbaric.\r\n\r\nMother 1:
    Well, Iâ\x80\x99m just exhausted.\r\n\r\nMother 2: Me too. Actually, half the
    time she sleeps in my bed. Thatâ\x80\x99s\r\nwhy I could never get a job. Iâ\x80\x99m
    too exhausted: motherhood is my\r\nfull-time job.\r\n\r\nIs it really barbaric
    to set limits for your children? To expect them\r\nto, say, put themselves to
    sleep and to sleep in their own bed? Or is it\r\nsimply weak and self-indulgent
    to refuse to draw the line, and to\r\ncharacterise this refusal as evidence of
    maternal love and dedication?\r\n\r\nThis is not an idle question (although I
    am sure some of you are wishing\r\nIâ\x80\x99d left it idling). Rather, it is
    an explosive issue that the womenâ\x80\x99s\r\nmovement has long sought to stifle
    with the rhetoric of â\x80\x9Cchoiceâ\x80\x9D. So\r\nwhile feminists have long
    struggled to enshrine all womenâ\x80\x99s social\r\nfreedom and legal right to
    work, regardless of whether they are married\r\nand/or mothers, most have argued
    that the decision to engage in paid\r\nwork or to make motherhood a full-time
    job is a womanâ\x80\x99s prerogative.\r\n\r\nBut which mothers exercise this prerogative?
    Not working-class married\r\nones whose wage is the only thing that keeps the
    family income above the\r\npoverty line. And not, since the most recent federal
    budget, the single\r\nwoman of school-age children whose mutual obligation to
    society now\r\ndemands she enter the workforce, or be in the process of becoming\r\nâ\x80\x9Cjob-readyâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nNo,
    the opportunity of making motherhood a long-term job is available\r\nonly to women
    who are either independently wealthy or whose husbandsâ\x80\x99\r\nsalaries push
    them safely into the â\x80\x9Cmiddle classâ\x80\x9D. Only middle-class\r\nwomen
    are socially lauded as â\x80\x9Cgoodâ\x80\x9D mothers for refusing to engage in\r\npaid
    work, while working-class women doing the same thing are labelled\r\nâ\x80\x9Cunemployedâ\x80\x9D
    or - if receiving benefits - â\x80\x9Cdole bludgersâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nSo are unemployed
    middle-class women of older children really â\x80\x9Cgoodâ\x80\x9D\r\nmothers
    or are they women unable to enter the workforce - at least at\r\nthe level they
    would be forced to start back on, having spent so many\r\nyears out of the workforce?
    For those with minimal education or job\r\nexperience, the former may be the case;
    the latter is extremely likely\r\nfor the remainder, given inadequate maternity
    leave provisions and a\r\nlack of career-track part-time employment and guaranteed
    re-entry at\r\nexit level of seniority.\r\n\r\nHereâ\x80\x99s some more anecdotal
    evidence. All the women I know who remained\r\nout of the workforce until two
    or more children reached school age found\r\nit extremely difficult to get back
    in at all, or at a level commensurate\r\nwith their skills. All felt that employers
    wanted to know what they were\r\ndoing all that time and considered the answer
    - raising children -\r\ninadequate, particularly once the children they were talking
    about were\r\nolder than two.\r\n\r\nSome of these women bit the bullet and took
    whatever work they could\r\nget, often finding that, once in, they progressed
    quickly through the\r\nranks - although none are back where they would be had
    they never left.\r\nOthers got angry, disillusioned, scared (or all of the above)
    and either\r\ngot pregnant again, or started talking up - as per mother 2 above
    - the\r\nstrenuous demands of mothering school-age children.\r\n\r\nIndeed some,
    once they saw the job-opportunity writing on the wall,\r\nworked hard to make
    those demands more strenuous. Itâ\x80\x99s amazing how\r\ndemanding children can
    become when their every need and desire for a\r\nmotherâ\x80\x99s time and energy
    is indulged.\r\n\r\nFeminists must get off the fence and argue - without the classist
    waffle\r\nof â\x80\x9Cchoiceâ\x80\x9D - that all women have a right to, and should
    engage in, paid\r\nwork once their children are out of nappies, or not long after.
    Without\r\npaid employment, women lack social identity, social status and social\r\nfreedom.
    From the woman who feels ignored at the cocktail party once she\r\nreveals her
    long-term maternal role, to the victim of domestic violence\r\nlacking the means
    to take her kids and flee, paid work gives women\r\nthings long-term motherhood
    never can or will.\r\n\r\nAnd in the same way feminists insist it is menâ\x80\x99s
    moral and social\r\nresponsibility - not prerogative - to share domestic work,
    so must we\r\ninsist women have an obligation to share the work of bringing home
    the\r\nbacon. The best and most equitable way for this to be done is for both\r\npartners
    to work part-time.\r\n\r\nIndeed, once all women with older children engage in
    paid work, few are\r\nlikely to find it barbaric to set boundaries and limits
    for their\r\nchildren. This is because they will no longer rely on the endless
    amount\r\nof maternal work, generated by a lack of boundaries and limits, to\r\njustify
    their lack of paid employment.\r\n\r\nMotherhood will become as fatherhood is
    now: just one of the\r\nresponsibilities that women undertake in the course of
