  content: "Co-authored with Dr Elizabeth Finkel\r\n\r\nLate last year, the Lockhart
    Legislative Review Committee - the\r\nFederal Governmentâ\x80\x99s own handpicked
    experts - handed down its\r\nrecommendations on the fate of stem cell research
    in this country. Among\r\nother things, the Committee recommended lifting Australiaâ\x80\x99s
    ban on\r\nso-called â\x80\x9Ctherapeutic cloningâ\x80\x9D. Having first shelved
    the report on the\r\nbasis of a cabinet vote, a backbench revolt saw the Prime
    Minister agree\r\nto a broader discussion at the first party room meeting after
    winter\r\nbreak. That meeting - otherwise known as Stem Cell D-Day - is today.\r\n\r\nThe
    flashpoint of the debate will be therapeutic cloning. This type of\r\ncloning
    is not about copying people, but copying their cells.\r\n\r\nWhat is the potential
    of this technique? Imagine Mary, a child with\r\nleukaemia, needs a bone marrow
    graft to replace her diseased cells. One\r\nof her skin cells would be cloned
    to generate a primitive embryo. The\r\ncloning technique involves inserting the
    skin cellâ\x80\x99s nucleus - which\r\nruns the genetic program for skin - into
    a donated human egg thatâ\x80\x99s own\r\nnucleus has been removed. Being inside
    the egg resets the program of the\r\nskinâ\x80\x99s nucleus to begin dividing.
    Several days later embryonic stem\r\ncells will be extracted; a process that will
    halt all further\r\ndevelopment. The matched graft would significantly raise Maryâ\x80\x99s
    odds of\r\nsurvival.\r\n\r\nMaryâ\x80\x99s therapy has actually already been achieved
    in mice. In 2002, a US\r\nresearcher used the technique to give mice a perfectly
    matched bone\r\nmarrow transplant. â\x80\x9COh to be a mouseâ\x80\x9D, said the
    late Christopher Reeve.\r\nGeorge Daley now has a license to use therapeutic cloning
    to make\r\nmatched human bone marrow cells.\r\n\r\nAlternatively if Mary suffered
    from motor neuron disease or juvenile\r\ndiabetes, such cells would provide faithful
    models of the disease to\r\ntest new drugs. The promise of therapeutic cloning
    has already\r\ngalvanized research in the UK and the US where highly esteemed\r\nscientists
    are working for better treatment of bone marrow disease,\r\nmotor neuron disease,
    diabetes and the crippling disease amyotropic\r\nlateral sclerosis. Other countries
    also have the legislative freedom to\r\npursue this research: Canada, New Zealand,
    Sweden, Belgium, Spain,\r\nFinland, Israel, Singapore and China.\r\n\r\nMany in
    Howardâ\x80\x99s party are vehemently opposed to the technique. They\r\nbelieve
    it is morally repugnant to create and destroy an embryo. They\r\nalso vehemently
    contest the true therapeutic potential of the technique.\r\nOthers in the party
    believe the moral imperative to advance research\r\nthat could alleviate human
    suffering trumps concerns about the status of\r\nan embryo transiently created
    from a skin cell.\r\n\r\nThe Lockhart Review sought to cut through this debate
    and indicate a way\r\nforward. Lockhart argued that the views of different communities
    on the\r\nmoral acceptability of therapeutic cloning are not reconcilable, and,\r\nbecause
    research in this area is in its early stages, there is no point\r\nin second-guessing
    its long-term prospects. Given this, the Review\r\nadvised that the debate must
    shift to the proper role of governments in\r\nmanaging such radical moral disagreement.\r\n\r\nIt
    is this question, not irreconcilable ones about the moral status of\r\nthe embryo
    or the ultimate medical benefits of the science, that should\r\nbe at the centre
    of todayâ\x80\x99s party room debate about the fate of\r\nembryonic stem cell
    research in Australia.\r\n\r\nThe Lockhart Review advocated the Government adopt
    a compromise\r\napproach. Rather than allow the moral values of one section of
    the\r\ncommunity to ride roughshod over those held by the rest, it urged the\r\ngovernment
    to capitalise on areas of community consensus by, for\r\ninstance, continuing
    its ban on reproductive cloning. Where moral views\r\nwere hopelessly divided,
    it supported a licensing system where both\r\ninstitutional ethics committees
    and a government appointed committee of\r\nexperts examine each research proposal
    individually.\r\n\r\nThis is the type of regulatory framework that has been in
    place since\r\n2002 to control research using surplus embryos from fertility clinics.\r\nThus
    far nine licences, all of limited duration, have been issued, five\r\nfor improving
    fertility treatment, four for stem cell research. The\r\nlicensing requirements
    are stringent, with researchers needing to\r\njustify the purpose of the research
    and the number of embryos required.\r\n\r\nIn areas of radical moral disagreement,
    the proper role of government is\r\nto pursue meaningful compromise. The existing
    ban on therapeutic cloning\r\nserves as a legal brick wall. The Lockhart committee
    recommended\r\nreplacing the wall with a hurdle, high enough to block proposals
    of\r\nquestionable merit, but low enough to allow those of great worth to get\r\nover.\r\n\r\nIn
    a pluralist democracy like Australia, the Federal Government must\r\neither accept
    the Lockhart recommendations, or allow our elected\r\nrepresentatives to cast
    a conscience vote on the issue.\r\n\r\n*Dr. Elizabeth Finkel is a former biochemist
