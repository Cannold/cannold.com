    band Green Dayâ\x80\x99s Nice Guys Finish Last came in at No. 89 in\r\nthis summerâ\x80\x99s
    Hottest 100 on Triple J. But if the social Darwinian\r\ntheories of American academics
    Randy Thornhill and Greg Palmer are\r\nright, some of the guys who finish last
    in the race for partners arenâ\x80\x99t\r\nvery nice guys.\r\n\r\nYouâ\x80\x99ve
    got to say one thing for Thornhill and Palmer, they sure know how\r\nto grab media
    attention. A few weeks ago, they were Dr Nobodies: one\r\nholed up in the anthropology
    department at the University of Colorado,\r\nthe other with his face pressed to
    the glass of scorpionfly cages in New\r\nMexico. Now their theories have been
    headlined in The Chicago Tribune,\r\nThe New York Times, USA Today, Time Magazine,
    The Washington Post and\r\nThe Guardian. Theyâ\x80\x99ve been on Rush Limbaughâ\x80\x99s
    radio program, CNN, the\r\nCBS Early Show with Bryant Gumbel, and NBCâ\x80\x99s
    Today Show, to name a few.\r\n\r\nClearly the strategy of accusing feminist beliefs
    - in this case that\r\nrape is motivated by a male thirst for power rather than
    sex - of being\r\none-eyed and evidence-free is the calling-card for success with
    the\r\noverseas and domestic press.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, both Thornhill and Palmer
    seem unperturbed by the fact\r\nthat the evidence they provide to support their
    claims is flimsy and at\r\ntimes nonsensical.\r\n\r\nThey contend that rape is
    an unchangeable though undesirable biological\r\nphenomenon, much like a tornado
    or flood, and that it is about sex (by\r\nwhich they mean the Darwinian, programmed
    desire of all animals to pass\r\non their genes). Men who have been unsuccessful
    in attracting a female\r\nwith whom to copulate consensually use rape as a strategy
    to pass along\r\ntheir genetic legacy.\r\n\r\nBut the most persuasive evidence
    Thornhill and Palmer could muster - and\r\nI am truly too embarrassed to repeat
    their less convincing supporting\r\nfacts - are that most rape victims are women
    of child-bearing age, and\r\nthat rape occurs in a variety of animal species.\r\n\r\nWhat
    they fail to mention is that most rapists are also of child-bearing\r\nage. Not
    only are these men more likely to have greater access to\r\nsimilarly aged women,
    but women of this age are more likely than the\r\nvery young or very old to be
    out and about and so at risk of stranger\r\nrape. They are also more likely to
    be socially and sexually active and\r\nso at higher risk of â\x80\x9Cdateâ\x80\x9D
    rape.\r\n\r\nEvolutionary academics have a penchant for picking from the natural\r\nworld
    that which suits their usually sexist theories, and ignoring the\r\nrest. This
    means that the naturalness of human breeding and\r\nchild-rearing practices are
    never explained with reference to the\r\nextracurricular sexual activities of
    the female emu, which roots around\r\nwhile the male stays back at the nest hatching
    the eggs. Instead, they\r\nare seen as akin - in this case - to the mating habits
    of scorpionflies.\r\n\r\nThe scorpionfly, we are told, has a clamp-like appendage
    that seems\r\nspecially designed for rape. While no similar appendage has yet
    been\r\nlocated on the human male, our headline doctors proffer this discovery\r\nas
    proof of the pervasiveness of rape in the animal kingdom, and so the\r\nnaturalness
    and immutability of its occurrence among humans. In my view,\r\nscorpionfly behavior
    tells us as much (or as little) as does emu\r\nbehavior about what is natural
    for humans. Call me a nut.\r\n\r\nBut the strongest piece of evidence the Darwinian
    theory of rape has\r\ngoing for it - other than prime-time ratings - is the simple
    fact that\r\nmany sexual assaults do not involve the rapist penetrating the womanâ\x80\x99s\r\nvagina
    with his penis. And even when he does, he doesnâ\x80\x99t always\r\nejaculate.
    In addition, men rape other men, old women and children, a\r\nthird of whom are
    boys. This, if I am not mistaken, puts the\r\nmen-rape-to-spread-their-genes-around
    theory in a bit of a bind. It\r\nmeans that unless the evolutionary drive isnâ\x80\x99t
    the brightest light in\r\nthe harbor, it is a bad explanation for why and whom
    men choose to rape.\r\n\r\nAnd if rape is a â\x80\x9Csuccessfulâ\x80\x9D reproductive
    strategy, as our academics\r\nclaim, youâ\x80\x99ve got to wonder for whom. Sexual
    selection is a key aspect\r\nof Darwinâ\x80\x99s survival-of-the-fittest theory.
    Put crudely, it gives female\r\ndesires a strong say in the selection of a speciesâ\x80\x99
    characteristics.\r\nPeacock plumage is a lightning rod for the birdâ\x80\x99s
    predators, yet by\r\nmaking the cock more attractive to the hen, the bird with
    the largest,\r\nmost colorful plumage is at an advantage in the sexual selection
    stakes.\r\n\r\nIf a woman knocks back a blokeâ\x80\x99s request for consensual
    sex, and he\r\nrapes her, he upsets the delicate balance of sexual selection by
    -\r\nshould he actually impregnate her - spreading his \\`\\`unfitâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99
    genes\r\naround. Good for the individual male in question, maybe. Good - in\r\nDarwinian
    terms - for the human species? I donâ\x80\x99t think so.\r\n\r\nThornhill and
    Palmerâ\x80\x99s reinstatement of the boys-will-be-boys thesis\r\nabout why men
    rape has upset both men and women. Men are peeved at being\r\nre-tarred with the
    all-men-are-potential-rapists brush. Women involved\r\nin counselling sexual assault
    survivors are worried that such\r\ntheoretical walks in the woods might reverse
    hard-won political, legal\r\nand treatment trends that lay responsibility for
    sexual violence at\r\nmenâ\x80\x99s feet, rather than at womenâ\x80\x99s hemlines.\r\n\r\nBut
    they neednâ\x80\x99t worry. Claims by some angry anti-feminists that\r\nThornhill
    and Palmerâ\x80\x99s work is being knocked off by an aggressive case\r\nof feminist
    political correctness - the standard ploy for keeping\r\nanti-feminist agendas
    in the media for longer than they merit - wonâ\x80\x99t\r\nwork for long. Thornhill
    and Palmerâ\x80\x99s thesis simply doesnâ\x80\x99t stack up.\r\nAnd there are
    too many nice (and knowledgeable) men and women that say\r\nso."
