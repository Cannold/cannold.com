    the woeful shortage of\r\nqualified counselors in schools (in NSW the one to every
    1050 students\r\nis more than double the recommended ratio). After all, and quite\r\nliterally,
    the lives of children are at stake.\r\n\r\nYou might think so, but youâ\x80\x99d
    be wrong. Instead, the Gillard government\r\nhas deployed chaplains. School chaplains
    come from organizations like\r\nScripture Union Australia which sees them as a
    means by which they can\r\nfulfil their organizational aim of, â\x80\x9Cmak[ing]
    Godâ\x80\x99s Good News known to\r\nchildren [and] young peopleâ\x80\x9D so â\x80\x9Cthey

    church members.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThe Government knows chaplains are evangelical
    Christians, not mental\r\nhealth experts. This is why departmental guidelines
    prohibit chaplains\r\nfrom counseling students. They also ban chaplains from providing\r\neducational
    and medical services, as well as from proselytising. All of\r\nwhich begs the
    question: what exactly are we paying chaplains $20,000\r\neach to do?\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99m
    not the only one wondering. As a report on the program reveals, many\r\nchaplains
    are unclear about their role. A majority admits they do deal\r\nwith student mental
    health and depression issues, student alcohol and\r\ndrug use, physical/emotional
    abuse and neglect, and suicide and\r\nself-harming behaviours. What most donâ\x80\x99t

    Rather it is an argument about wrong choices made for\r\nbad reasons that are
    putting our most vulnerable schoolchildren at risk.\r\nIn a world of scarce resources,
    money spent on chaplains is money that\r\ncould have brought-wait for it-around
    5000 qualified counselors into our\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nChaplains are also accidents

    the school P&C.\r\n\r\nSo what did our children to deserve our negligence? Nothing.
