    human rights and non-governmental organisations about the law in regard to Census
    2016 and the potential ramifications of boycotting or protesting the threats posed
    to individual privacy. The advice I got is below. I hope this helps you to make
    an informed choice about whether and how to protest the Census.*\r\n\r\n**Failing
    to complete any or all of the Census is NOT an offense**\r\n\r\nIt only becomes
    an offense if, having failed to complete it at all or to omit some information
    (like name and/or address), the Chief Statistician orders you to complete it.
    \r\n\r\nThis sounds technical but is VERY, VERY important. {{ excerpt_separator }} It means that you can
    refuse to fill out all or part of the Census without a worry or care in the world.
    If, and only if, the Chief Statistician directs you to complete it, are you at
    risk of being fined. You can make a decision about completing it or continuing
    to refuse then. \r\n\r\n**Paper forms are Essential for Those Wishing to Protest
    the Census **\r\n\r\nAnswering the Census online allow the ABS to store your IP
    address and precludes you omitting answer to any questions but the one about religion
    (which remains optional). Some have tried to provide their name and address, complete
    the rest of the questions on the electronic forms and then try to get back to
    their name and address and omit them before submitting the form. Nope, it doesnâ\x80\x99t
    work. \r\n\r\nWhat this means is that if youâ\x80\x99re planning to protest the
    censusâ\x80\x99s privacy invasion by omiting identifying and/or other details,
    youâ\x80\x99ll need the paper form The good news is that these are now easier
    to get from the ABS. Theyâ\x80\x99ve finally got an automated system up and running
    so, when you ring up with the unique identifying code from your census letter,
    they post one to your address (and yes, this means they know where those with
    that unique number live). \r\n\r\n**Protest or Boycott? **\r\n\r\nAs noted, you
    can do either without committing an offense. But if you want to take action now,
    or are eventually directed by the Chief Statistician to submit or complete your
    census, what should you do? \r\n\r\nThe safer option seems to be to protest. This
    means completing the census carefully and honestly but omiting your name and/or
    address. If the ABS decides to fine you and you refuse to pay the fine â\x80\x93
    an option it has but that most believe they would be foolish to exercise â\x80\x93
    you may be in a stronger position with a Magistrate as a conscientious objector
    in regard to a few questions because of privacy concerns, than as someone who
    has refuse to participate all together. \r\n\r\nWhy? Because those who have a
    feel for the Magistrateâ\x80\x99s Court say itâ\x80\x99s likely to be seen as
    reasonable and responsible to accept oneâ\x80\x99s duty as a citizens to provide
    data necessary for government to plan and provide services but to exclude information
    non-essential for that purpose and that risks oneâ\x80\x99s privacy. Census refusing,
    on the other hand, may be viewed as too â\x80\x9Cextreme,â\x80\x9D and could lead
    to a larger fine ($1800 is the max for a census-related offense). \r\n\r\nJust
    to be clear, Iâ\x80\x99m not saying you shouldnâ\x80\x99t boycott the census or
    that boycotting isnâ\x80\x99t a valid form of protest. Iâ\x80\x99m also not saying
    itâ\x80\x99s more likely to lead to a direction from the Chief Statistician to
    get in line. In fact, my sources believe the likelihood of the ABS taking anyone
    refusing to complete their census and/or pay the fine is 5/100. \r\n\r\nHowever,
    my aim here is to honestly relay the legal advice Iâ\x80\x99ve had and this indicates
    that the strategy most likely to lead to a more minimal fine (say, $180), or to
    have oneâ\x80\x99s case dismissed with no fine at all, is protesting rather than
    boycotting. \r\n\r\n**What Census Protesters should NOT Do**\r\n\r\nProtest or
    boycott, itâ\x80\x99s your pick. But if youâ\x80\x99re protesting, hereâ\x80\x99s
    what NOT do on either your electronic or paper census form: provide false information.
    Unless â\x80\x9CPerson 1,â\x80\x9D â\x80\x9CPerson 2â\x80\x9D or â\x80\x9CNamey
    McNamefaceâ\x80\x9D are your real names, they are false information. False information
    could seriously annoy a Magistrate (should you end up in front of one, see above
    for low odds of this). Annoyed Magistrates, and/or ones who feel you are failing
    to treat the purpose of the Census with due regard could fine you larger amounts
    than the $180/day that my informed friends are predicting will be the maximum
    if you refuse to give your name and/or address. Up to $1000, so watch yourself
    there. "
