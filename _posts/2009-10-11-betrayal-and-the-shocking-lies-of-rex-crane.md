    the fall\r\nfrom grace last week of the Federal President of the Prisoners of
    War\r\nAssociation of Australia, Rex Crane.\r\n\r\nCrane took us all for a ride.
    Now 83, he claimed he was Australiaâ\x80\x99s\r\nyoungest POW. Abandoned in Malaya
    by his family at age 15, he said the\r\nJapanese tortured him at Outram Road Jail
    in Singapore and on the\r\nThai-Burma railway.\r\n\r\nBut thanks to the due diligence
    of three women, one a professional\r\nhistorian, the more pedestrian truth about
    the events of Craneâ\x80\x99s life\r\nduring World War II are now known. He spent
    it at Adelaide High School,\r\nafter which he held a number of jobs, including
    running a pub. He was\r\nnever in the military.\r\n\r\nFriends and families-including
    a step granddaughter who cried with him\r\nas he told her stories of his wartime
    suffering-have responded to\r\nCraneâ\x80\x99s public undoing with shock, astonishment
    and bewilderment. This\r\nhas been followed by embarrassment, horror and mortification.
    Anger will\r\nalmost certainly come later. Those more distant to the Crane, including\r\nwar
    historians and returned servicemen, have used words like galled,\r\ndisgusted
    and appalled. The Australian Federal Police are now pursuing\r\nCrane-who has
    received the top pension award, a $25,000 bonus payment\r\nand a Commonwealth
    Gold Card covering all medical expenses-for fraud.\r\n\r\nCraneâ\x80\x99s story
    is one of betrayal. â\x80\x9CNo Judas, no story,â\x80\x9D says writer and\r\nbroadcaster
    Libbi Gorr, and surely she is right. Betrayers occupied the\r\ninnermost ring
    of Danteâ\x80\x99s inferno and Jane Austenâ\x80\x99s *Sense and\r\nSensibility*
    is preoccupied with the theme. Since the dawn of the\r\nChristian era, betrayal
    has been central to the seminal and everyday\r\nstories that shape and describe
    our lives.\r\n\r\nOdd then, that we find it so hard to define both act and emotion
    with\r\ndepth and precision. Disloyalty and treachery is the best the dictionary\r\ncan
    come up, while philosophers do little better. As Rodger L. Jackson\r\nhas noted,
    few treatments of the subject capture the elements of\r\ncharacter, circumstance
    and motive that give betrayal its flavour, and\r\ndetermine the cost to victims.\r\n\r\nBetrayal
    is an assault on trust. Rex Craneâ\x80\x99s lies about his wartime\r\nactivities
    betrayed the most fundamental trust we offer those we love,\r\nlive with, befriend
    and admire-what we must offer if such a thing as a\r\nrelationship is to exist.
    An automatic, unquestioning faith that people\r\nare who they claim to be. While
    publicly disowning him, as his step\r\ngranddaughter has done, may alleviate the
    guilt and shame society\r\nunfairly heaps on those associated with wrongdoers
    by blood or marriage,\r\nthose closest to Crane may require professional support.
    How else to\r\nensure the anger they must feel is directed out towards him, rather
    than\r\nin on themselves, eroding confidence in their character judgment or\r\nmorphing
    into depression.\r\n\r\nSociety must walk a similarly fine line. Veteranâ\x80\x99s
    affairs Minister Alan\r\nGriffin has rightly referred the case to the Australian
    Federal police,\r\nand avoided buying into the claims being made by self-appointed\r\nguardians
    of military authenticity that public and ex-servicemen are\r\nregularly being
    ripped off by military â\x80\x9Cimpostersâ\x80\x9D like Crane.\r\n\r\nWe must
    not allow betrayal to undermine our trust in what Rodger calls\r\nâ\x80\x9Cthe
    worldâ\x80\x99s possibilities,â\x80\x9D or increase our distrust or skepticism.\r\nBecause
    the truth is that most people are worthy of our trust. They\r\nwonâ\x80\x99t let
    us down. And it is we whoâ\x80\x99d be the fools if we let men like\r\nCrane make
    us see the world any other way."
