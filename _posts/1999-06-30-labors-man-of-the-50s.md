    Ferguson, the federal Labor frontbencher and former ACTU head,\r\nargues that
    to win power, the ALP must re-embrace its core working-class\r\nconstituency:
    the shrinking pool of blue-collar workers and the great\r\nmajority of Australians
    employed in routine jobs.\r\n\r\nMost working women are employed in such routine
    jobs, but Ferguson (who\r\noutlined his case on this page on 14 June) restricts
    his explicit\r\ndiscussion of women to those who \\`\\`choose not to enter the
    paid\r\nworkforce during important parts of their livesâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99. Like
    the battlers,\r\nFerguson contends, these women have been forgotten by Labor.\r\n\r\nFergusonâ\x80\x99s
    view of Laborâ\x80\x99s future embraces the coalitionâ\x80\x99s successful\r\ndeployment
    of US-style \\`\\`wedgeâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 politics. His recipe for political\r\nsuccess
    intimates that Labor ought to pursue coalition-established\r\nelectoral divisions
    between battlers and special-interest groups,\r\nbetween forgotten mothers at
    home and middle-class tertiary-educated\r\nfemocrats.\r\n\r\nNice world view -
    pity about the facts. The world I live in is one in\r\nwhich distinctions between
    blue-collar and tertiary-educated job-seekers\r\nand keepers are fast disappearing.
    Not only is a university education no\r\nlonger a ticket to a good job, itâ\x80\x99s
    no guarantee of any job. Graduates\r\ncobble together several McJobs, try their
    luck overseas, or join their\r\n\\`\\`social inferiorsâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 in the
    dole queue.\r\n\r\nAmong those with jobs, the distinctions between blue-collar
    and\r\n\\`\\`privilegedâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99 are even more blurred. Both groups complain
    of having\r\nto work harder than they used to, with less job security and fewer\r\nbenefits.
    Both lack adequate planning advice and savings schemes for\r\nretirement, predictable
    working hours, a cap on the number of hours\r\nworked, compensation for overtime,
    adequate staffing levels to do the\r\njob properly, paid maternity/paternity and
    parental leave, and on-site\r\nchild care - to name a few. If Ferguson had been
    paying attention, he\r\nmight have noticed that some higher-paid workers are seeking
    to redress\r\ntheir concerns in a manner similar to their \\`\\`blue-collarâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\ncounterparts:
    by unionising.\r\n\r\nIn Ferguson-land, forgotten working-class women \\`\\`chooseâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99
    to remain\r\noutside the workforce. They feel unrepresented by \\`\\`femocratsâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\ninterested
    in equality of opportunity, sex discrimination legislation,\r\nchild care and
    other issues of sole concern to the educated middle\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nAgain, reality
    rudely intrudes into this antiquated\r\nwhen-men-were-men-and-sheep-were-nervous
    view of Australia. More than\r\nhalf the women in the labor force are \\`\\`working
    classâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 (employed as\r\nclerks, saleswomen or personal service
    providers), and many are mothers.\r\nForty-eight per cent of women with children
    under five have a job, or\r\nwant one. Once their children reach school age, 60per
    cent of mothers\r\nare in the workforce. They, like all women, want high-quality
    and\r\naffordable care for their children, a fair dayâ\x80\x99s wages and a safe\r\nworking
    environment.\r\n\r\nIn future the proportion of working mothers in all income
    levels is\r\nlikely to skyrocket. A recent survey of 39,000 young Australian women\r\nfound
    those from lower-income backgrounds aspire - to almost the same\r\nextent as those
    from higher-income backgrounds - to professional,\r\npara-professional or managerial
    positions. Given that longitudinal\r\nstudies consistently suggest that young
    peopleâ\x80\x99s estimation of their\r\nfuture paths are almost always on the
    mark, these figures signal a big\r\nshift in future working patterns of lower-income
    women.\r\n\r\nAs lower-income women begin fulfilling their aspirations for more\r\nprofessional
    work, the number of babies they have is also likely to\r\ndecline. This will lead
    to a contraction in Fergusonâ\x80\x99s forgotten\r\nheartland of women outside
    the labor force, given that women without\r\nchildren will have fewer reasons
    to stay at home.\r\n\r\nA recent marketing survey of more than 1200 Australian
    mothers found\r\nthat while women with good employment prospects were happy staying
    at\r\nhome, those who felt their chance for paid work was poor were\r\ndissatisfied
    with life as a full-time mum. This latter group experienced\r\nmotherhood as a
    sacrifice, and their sense of powerlessness makes them\r\nsoft targets for the
    \\`\\`good mummy/bad mummyâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 wedge-style advertising\r\nand politics
    so successfully exploited by the coalition at the last\r\nelection and now enshrined
    in the tax package.\r\n\r\nGlobalisation has not only made the needs and aspirations
    of countries\r\nmore similar, but has homogenised the needs and aspirations of
    an\r\nincreasingly global citizenry. Such similarities will increasingly cut\r\nacross
