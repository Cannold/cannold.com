    see the father who\r\ndoesnâ\x80\x99t live with them; and that before 1989, when
    the law gave men a\r\nchoice about chipping in financially to support their children,

    and subsequent language development would arrive in the\r\nmail: proof of his

    was less certain of what he\r\nhad to offer to his daughter who is three, no four,
    no three. He hadnâ\x80\x99t\r\nseen her in years. â\x80\x9CI donâ\x80\x99t even
    have a place to live at the moment,â\x80\x9D he\r\nconfessed. â\x80\x9CHad all

    by Australian researcher Jennifer McIntosh finds that shared\r\ncare is not the
