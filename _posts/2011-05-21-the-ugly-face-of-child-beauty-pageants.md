    just to be depressed by images of overblown, cap-toothed, heavily made-up under-fives
    but the obvious yet rarely commented upon fact that all these kids are girls.\r\n\r\nThis
    issue is red hot in Australia right now, as the June date for the first American-style
    child pageant to be held in this country approaches. But as psychologists predict
    future insecurity, eating disorders and depression for participants, and religious
    pseudo-feminists rhapsodise about lost childhood innocence, it's critical we separate
    the hyperbolic wheat from the chaff. What is the real problem with child beauty
    pageants and what, if anything, should be done about them?\r\n\r\nHard data is
    thin on the ground and so far doesn't support the future mental illness thesis.
    But what one US study found when interviewing 41 pageant mums â\x80\x93 and it
    is nearly always mothers who push girls as young as one into competition â\x80\x93
    is that often social class and female life experiences are behind the choice.\r\n\r\nSome
    pageant mums are living out their own dreams of \"go[ing] somewhere in life\",
    as one mother put it, rather than being \"stuck at home\" due to early childbearing.
    While self-focused female ambition continues to be stigmatised in Western societies
    â\x80\x93 with the ambitious working woman always contrasted unfavourably with
    the mum who sacrifices her career to stay at home â\x80\x93 pageant mums justify
    their application of false eyelashes or even Botox to their children as evidence
    of a competitive desire for their daughter to win.\r\n\r\nA winning child's booty
    â\x80\x93 including cash, cars, cruises and holidays â\x80\x93 was sometimes essential
    to the income of some families, as was the walking advertisement they provided
    for family businesses that provided pageant-related services such as costumes
    and photography.\r\nParents who propel their children into after-school study
    say they want the experience to teach their kids confidence and the value of practice.
    They also want their sons and daughters to learn how to follow a schedule, to
    develop the speed necessary to perform well on standardised tests and to become
    more disciplined and focused. This contrasts with the wish-list pageant mums have
    for their daughters which includes becoming comfortable on stage, learning poise,
    how to present themselves and to dress appropriately.\r\n\r\nOne only has to imagine
    a father bemoaning his lost future due to early child rearing or a mother parading
    her elaborately costumed son on a stage in the name of his future poise and dress
    sense to see the gender-based nature of the pageant problem. In the long term,
    only a society that allows women to fulfil their own ambitions â\x80\x93 rather
    than sublimating them by living vicariously through their kids â\x80\x93 will
    see off the beauty pageant bogey for good.\r\n\r\nMeantime, child beauty pageants
    should be banned, but a gender-equitable alternative supported. Something like
    a child talent show, which is pretty much what pageants become once the beauty/formalwear
    competition â\x80\x93 and appearance-related palaver â\x80\x93 is removed from
    the mix. Such a competition must be open to, and be designed to appeal to, boys
    and girls in the same way adolescents of both sexes are drawn to So You Think
    You Can Dance.\r\n\r\nThe child beauty pageant issue must not become fodder for
    the seemingly endless mummy wars, or be used to satisfy the rapacious desire of
    evangelical Christians to have influence over other people's children. Instead,
    we need to support parents to have the same aspirations for their daughters' development
    and future success as they do their sons."
