    needs to be done\r\n\r\nHas the budget left the single and childless out in the
    cold? Speaking\r\non our ABC this morning, Peter Costello said, â\x80\x9Cno.â\x80\x9D
    According to the\r\ntreasurer, the fact that most childless singles will one day
    form\r\nfamilies means they will - and know they will - eventually be the\r\nbeneficiaries
    of handouts to new mothers and couples with kids.\r\n\r\nCostello is right, and
    his claim points to an important and often\r\nignored cause of Australiaâ\x80\x99s
    plummeting fertility rate. According to my\r\nresearch, one of the reasons some
    women hesitate about having children\r\nis that they notice the tough time contemporary
    mothers are having\r\nbalancing work and family, and donâ\x80\x99t want to share
    their pain. To\r\ncontinue to behave as though government policy and workplace
    practices\r\nonly affect todayâ\x80\x99s parents, instead of the potential parents
    of\r\ntomorrow, is both naive and dangerous.\r\n\r\nHereâ\x80\x99s how it works.
    A single women works alongside a number of women\r\nwith children, some single
    mums, others married with partners. Or sheâ\x80\x99s\r\ngot sisters, cousins or
    friends who have kids. During lunchbreaks, on\r\nthe phone, at family events,
    over dinner, these mothers tell their tales\r\nof trying - and in modern-day Australia
    - failing to achieve their\r\ndesire to be good parents in happy marriages and,
    at the same time,\r\nremain valued employees. Childless women listen to complaints
    mothers\r\nmake about the costs of childcare, and their worries about its impact
    on\r\ntheir kids. They hear about the arguments mothers have with their blokes\r\nover
    who does the drop-offs, washes the clothes, feeds the dog and takes\r\nthe day
    off when the child is sick. They guiltily observe, as childless\r\ncommentator
    Sian Prior admitted, mothers being â\x80\x9Cpunished for not staying\r\nback late
    in the officeâ\x80\x9D and are aware that their own career advancement\r\ncomes
    at the expense of these â\x80\x9Cexhausted but determinedâ\x80\x9D women.\r\nChildless
    women hear and watch all this and they think: I want to\r\nmother, but not like
    this. And they delay a little longer.\r\n\r\nChildless men are also paying attention
    to whatâ\x80\x99s going on around them.\r\nDespite the hype, growing numbers of
    them are committed, when they\r\nfinally do become fathers, to being â\x80\x9Caccessibleâ\x80\x9D
    and intimately involved\r\nin their childâ\x80\x99s life. One survey found that
    many want to reduce their\r\nhours when their kids are young. But in a country
    where growing numbers\r\nof men are insecurely employed, maternity leave - little
    less paternity\r\nleave - remains pie-in-the-sky, and where workers who do less
    than 40\r\n(and in some industries 60) hour weeks miss out on promotion and pay\r\nrises,
    they know these ambitions have little chance of being fulfilled.\r\nSo they too
    delay.\r\n\r\nHow big a helping hand does the budget lend parents and, consequently,\r\nthose
    considering becoming them? Itâ\x80\x99s a step in the right direction, but\r\nunfortunately,
    still far less than what is needed to considerably\r\nimprove the capacity of
    parents to simultaneously fulfil their ambitions\r\nto be both good parents and
    successful workers. Unfortunately, this\r\nmeans it is insufficient to convince
    the deliberating and planning group\r\nof potential parents - those I call the
    Waiters and Watchers - to say\r\nâ\x80\x9Cyesâ\x80\x9D to having kids.\r\n\r\nWhat
    else will be necessary? Men are more likely to take paternity leave\r\nif it is
    offered beyond the first year of a childâ\x80\x99s life, and a recent\r\nstudy
    from Brown University contends that in families where the father\r\nshoulders
    half the burden of the â\x80\x9Csecond shift,â\x80\x9D mothers say â\x80\x9Cyesâ\x80\x9D
    to\r\nmore kids. This suggests that if parents were given enough money to fund\r\none
    year of leave at nearly-full pay which they could use until the\r\nchild went
    to school - the current situation in Norway - they would be\r\nable to divide
    the childcare burden between them, while each retained a\r\nfirm foothold in the
    workplace. This sort of package would give parents\r\nthe option of totally avoiding
    paid care in the first few years of the\r\nchildâ\x80\x99s life if this was their
    preference, or alternatively combining\r\nparental and paid childcare across a
    larger number of years. Of course,\r\nfor such a plan to work, high quality childcare
    needs to be the norm and\r\nmust become affordable which, at around $50 per day
    per child, it not\r\nnow the case.\r\n\r\nThis should, as long as it was coupled
    with changed social attitudes\r\nabout what â\x80\x9Cgoodâ\x80\x9D mothers and
    fathers do, new workplace attitudes about\r\nthe â\x80\x9Cseriousnessâ\x80\x9D
    of part-time workers, and government guarantees to\r\nparents that their job,
    or one at the same level and wages, will be\r\nwaiting for them when they return,
    would decrease the economic and\r\nsocial costs currently born by those raising
    the next generation.\r\n\r\nAnd, as a result, should lead many of those currently
    considering\r\nparenthood to finally take the plunge."
