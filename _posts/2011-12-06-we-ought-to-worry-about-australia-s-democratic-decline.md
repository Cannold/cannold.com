  content: "There's been much talk recently about a decline in the ''civility'' of
    our public debate. This follows a long period of anxiety about ''values'' and
    disgruntlement about ''spin'', and - if I'm reading the tea leaves right - will
    soon give way to sustained fretting about what our Prime Minister recently called
    the ''Americanisation'' of Australian politics.\r\n\r\nI don't think we've put
    our finger on the precise nature of the problem yet. But we're not jumping at
    shadows. There is something rotten in the state of Australian democracy, something
    about which we have good reason to worry.\r\n\r\nThe problem isn't etiquette,
    but a rise in lawlessness. There are rules that have long governed the way the
    democratic game is played, rules that arise from Enlightenment values. These define
    what is and isn't cricket when it comes to how individuals and institutions engage
    in our democracy.\r\n\r\nIt is these procedures and values, often unarticulated
    and widely taken for granted, that are under siege now - and this is the cause
    of Australia's democratic decline.\r\n\r\nWho broke the rules first? I'm neither
    sure, nor sure it matters. Key democratic institutions are so interconnected that
    unremarked cheating from one corner - especially if rewarded with unfair advantage
    over competitors - will quickly lead to a frenzy of lawlessness as other players
    rush for a piece of the action.\r\n\r\nSome of the blame certainly lies with our
    political leaders. A number of Canberra insiders pick the early 1990s as the moment
    when they began tinkering with policy-making processes in ways that compromised
    their capacity to uphold their sworn oath to serve the public.\r\nAround this
    time, says Laura Tingle from The Australian Financial Review, politicians stopped
    seeing big business as a vested interest or ''rent seeker'' and began viewing
    it as a ''stakeholder''.\r\n\r\nThe test against which policy interventions proposed
    by corporate Australia began to be judged was not whether they served the public
    interest, or conformed to basic demands of consistency or logic, but whether they
    could be sold to voters. Recalls Tingle: ''A lobbyist with long links to the Coalition
    observed to me that, in the Hawke/Keating days, you had to come to see ministers
    armed with microeconomic modelling to back your case â\x80¦ In the Howard era
    you had to come armed with focus group polling and research.''\r\n\r\nBig business
    responded to the new lie of the land with alacrity. A new class of public policy
    professionals emerged, including lobbyists, spin doctors and consultants from
    private sector ''consultancies'' who began challenging key institutions such as
    Treasury with their own budget forecasts, economic modelling and made-to-order
    ''research''. The result, says Crikey Canberra correspondent Bernard Keane, is
    laws and policies that don't have a ''shred of evidence or logic'' behind them.\r\n\r\nThe
    Fourth Estate, exercising its key role in a functioning democracy as defender
    of the public's right to know, could have contested the new paradigm, but didn't.
    Instead, and for a range of complex reasons, it went along for the ride. The result
    is a news media congested with public relations material, and that regularly features
    vested corporate interests (or their paid mouthpieces) as credible public policy
    ''experts''.\r\n\r\nAs well, analysis of the doing of politics, rather than of
    the substantive issues, is rife. On his recent trip to Melbourne, New York media
    academic Jay Rosen pointed to ABC TV's Insiders as evidence of much that is rotten
    with Australian political coverage: ''Promoting journalists as insiders in front
    of the outsiders, the viewers, the electorate, [shows] journalists are identifying
    with the wrong people.''\r\nWe are worried about our democracy for good reason.
    Lawlessness leads to more lawlessness, and the upholding of procedures and values
    such as reason, evidence and the public interest have been keys to the success
    of Australian democracy thus far.\r\n\r\nBut we shouldn't despair. This is not
    an omelet that can't be unscrambled. Politicians could start turning things around
    tomorrow by restoring pre-1990 policy-making processes. They could also - if I
    might be so bold - learn how to hold their nerve. Our elected representatives
    are not helpless in the face of tabloid media campaigns or corporate advertising
    blitzes, however uncomfortable they may find the heat that's generated. Ultimately,
    they are the decision-makers. It's time they started acting like them.\r\n\r\nThe
    media must play a role, too, abandoning its mischaracterisation of corporate and
    other sectional interests as capable of offering insight in the public interest
    dimensions of policy. Of course, this turnaround won't stop big corporations from
    seeking influence to shape the world according to their interests. It will just
    stop them being so successful.\r\nWe're on the road to hell together on this one.
    The only way back to a healthy democracy is for all the key players - business,
    political decision-makers and the media - to take a collective step back. \r\n\r\nLet's
    hope they do before the essence of what we value about our democracy is gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
