    \r\n\r\nExcerpts were broadcast on Radio National's [Big Ideas](http://www.abc.net.au/rn/bigideas/stories/2011/3214059.htm).\r\n\r\nRead
    it below:\r\n\r\n**Australiaâ\x80\x99s Fading Separation Between Church and State**\r\n\r\n*Part
    1 Australiaâ\x80\x99s Inclusive Approach to the Secular State*\r\n\r\nNow if Max
    Wallace were here I could hear him muttering under his breath that unlike the
    US, Australia doesnâ\x80\x99t really have a separation of church and state. This
    is because - despite the wording of Sec 116 in the Oz constitution being more
    or less the same as that found in the US one   - the Australian courts have interpreted
    the provision narrowly and so a clear line has never been drawn.  \r\n\r\nNow
    while some see this as a failure, others protest. They say that itâ\x80\x99s not
    that Australia doesnâ\x80\x99t do secularism, itâ\x80\x99s just that we do it
    differently. Not worse, not better, just differently to how itâ\x80\x99s done
    in the USA or in France. \r\n\r\nThese folks say that rather than bar religion
    from the public square, Australia has an inclusive approach that delivers religious
    freedom, religious fairness and state neutrality with regard to religion by allowing
    all faiths equal access to the public square. Those of no faith, as is usual with
    such things, are rarely mentioned. \r\n\r\nMy response to this is to say well,
    if that is true â\x80\x93 if Australia does the secular state in a unique an inclusive
    manner â\x80\x93 than this approach is fatally flawed and has proved to be a miserable
    failure. A miserable failure. \r\n\r\nPrincipled Problem with Inclusive Secularism\r\n\r\nAn
    inclusive approach to the secular state is an inherently flawed approach, doomed
    to failure. Having examined this concept from every angle, held it up to the light,
    examined every possibility â\x80\x93 sound like someone we know? â\x80\x93 I struggle
    to see how it could ever work. Because whatever the denomination, a fundamentalist
    approach to religious texts and truths makes one intolerant and disrespectful
    of difference. There are always fundamentalists, and they are always intolerant
    and disrespectful of difference. Why? Because they believe they have sole access
    to the truth and, by virtue of this, that those who disagree with them are just
    plain wrong.\r\n\r\nTo give you a feel for what such intolerance looks like and
    leads to, hereâ\x80\x99s a quote from the recently released Australian Human Rights
    Commissionâ\x80\x99s look at Freedom of Religion and Belief in 21st Century Australia.
    The quote is from the Gospel Assembly of Melbourne. The Gospel Assembly told the
    studyâ\x80\x99s authors that: \r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CThe Australian government is obligated
    to respect the Christian religion as its first and foremost responsibility. We
    object to the idea that other religions are equal to the worship of Almighty God
    \"\r\n\r\nThis quote doesnâ\x80\x99t just show us what intolerance looks like,
    it points to where it leads. Where it leads, as the Assembly makes clear, is to
    a view that because the Assemblyâ\x80\x99s Christian worldview is correct, this
    view and the policy prescriptions that fall out of it, should rightfully be privileged
    above all others in the community. Indeed, so right are they that they should
    be enshrined in laws that govern all of us, even those who are not members of
    the Christian flock, or any religious flock at all. Oops, there goes the secular
    state. \r\n\r\nNow, having once been an undergraduate student of psychology, I
    am aware that those who are truly confident of their truths donâ\x80\x99t necessarily
    feel compelled to put their views into forms that command others not compelled
    by them must obey. However, for those who lack such confidence, there is a compulsion
    to proselytize. This is because converting others provides external proof of the
    truth of oneâ\x80\x99s case, as in â\x80\x9Clook how many people agree with me,
    I must be right!â\x80\x9D Thus, for the fundamentalist who, intolerant by brand
    is insecure by nature, the tolerant and inclusive multi-faith space is one they
    are compelled to colonise as a means to their own end and by so doing, of course,
    devour secularism in the process. \r\n\r\nAn example of this with which we are
    all familiar with is the misuse by Muslim jihadists of the freedom of speech and
    religious tolerance found in western democracies to spread their own violently
    intolerant ideologies. My point here is not to suggest that this modus operandi
    is not morally repugnant and a real cause for alarm â\x80\x93 it is â\x80\x93
    but to point out that in Australia the risks it poses emanate primarily from evangelical
    Christian fundamentalists, not jihadist Muslims. \r\n\r\n*Part II: Practical Problems
    with Inclusive Secularism*\r\n\r\nSo now that weâ\x80\x99ve looked at the inherent
    problems with any sort of inclusive Oz approach to the secular state, I want to
    turn to the consequences of this approach. To ask, if what weâ\x80\x99ve got is
    an inclusive secular state, how itâ\x80\x99s working? To do this I want to look
    at two programs currently running in Australian government schools that the founding
    fathers intended to be, and indeed are still believed to be, free, compulsory
    and secular by nature. Those two programs are Special Religious Education or â\x80\x9CScriptureâ\x80\x9D
    Classes and School Chaplaincy. \r\n\r\nScripture\r\n\r\n319,305 Victorian children
    attend scripture classes. The law requires these to be delivered by volunteers.
    96% of whom are provided by ACCESS Ministries. ACCESS is an umbrella group representing
    12 Christian denominations, including the Anglicans Church of Australia, Uniting
    Church, Lutheran Church of Australia and the Salvation Army. Parents of prep children
    are deliberately NOT informed that their school is compelled to allow access to
    their children to any scripture provider that demands it, nor are they even necessarily
    told scripture classes will be a regular part of their childâ\x80\x99s school
    week and that they have the right to opt their children out. \r\n\r\nShould the
    process fail to deliver these key understandings â\x80\x93 a process that is an
    insult to informed consent and the zealously-guarded right of the religious to
    have choice and control over their own childrenâ\x80\x99s education â\x80\x93
    their five year old will wind up on a Christian scripture class by default. This,
    as I said, is something they may not become aware of until Jenny arrives home
    swearing that God loves her more than mummy or, as a Twitter follower from Victoria
    reported, that it rains when God is angry. \r\n\r\nACCESS Ministries is the only
    Victoria â\x80\x9Cscripture providerâ\x80\x9D that receives government funding.
    Indeed, only a few weeks ago the Victorian Education Minister Martin Dixon lobbed
    an additional $200,000 of taxpayer funds at ACCESS to improve volunteer training.
    This was on top of the more than $516,000 they already get from taxpayers, and
    a funding decision about which a Buddhist community leader, interviewed by The
    Ageâ\x80\x99s Michael Bachelard complained bitterly. The Buddhists provide scripture
    teachers to just 14 Victorian schools. Because they donâ\x80\x99t get government
    funding, they simply cannot afford to do more. Said Dr Sue Smith, â\x80\x9C'There
    is definitely a funding bias. Ours is funded by volunteers and donations.'' \r\n\r\nChildren
    whose parents opt them out either because they have no faith, are of a minority
    faith not able to be catered for or who are appalled at the ACCESS curricula,
    experience discrimination. Separated from their classmates to endure enforced
    idleness â\x80\x93 the education department guidelines forbid any secular instruction
    to be offered when SRE classes are on â\x80\x93 young children can understand
    the sorting process as punishment. This is particularly the case when they are
    placed outside of the principalâ\x80\x99s office, by the photocopying machine
    or in a broom closet for what we are told are supervisory purposes and no, about
    the broom closet, Iâ\x80\x99m not kidding. \r\n\r\nNow one defence to those prosecuting
    the â\x80\x9CAustralia-does-secularism-differentlyâ\x80\x9D argument might be
    that while kids are admittedly being corralled into Christian scripture classes
    delivered by ACCESS Ministries volunteers, thatâ\x80\x99s OK. Why? Because the
    ACCESS curriculum is inclusive and tolerant. It teaches about all the worldâ\x80\x99s
    religions and thatâ\x80\x99s something important for kids to understand so they
    can develop tolerance. Yep, I couldnâ\x80\x99t agree more. General Religious Education
    is a terrific thing, but sadly General Religious Education is something entirely
    different to what ACCESS and other volunteers are delivering in the Special Religious
    Education spot. What ACCESS is doing is instructing kids in the beliefs and practices
    of a particular religion. In fact, the ACCESS curriculum is very much in line
    with their mission statement, which reads as follows: \r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9COur vision
    is to reach every student in Victoria with the Gospel. Join the vision and help
    us transform this nation for God.â\x80\x9D \r\n\r\nThis mission statement is similar
    to that of the other major scripture teacher provider, Scripture Union, which
    describes itself as, â\x80\x9CChristâ\x80\x99s ambassadors on the front line of
    ministry.â\x80\x9D \r\n\r\nOn the score card for inclusive secularism in action,
    Australiaâ\x80\x99s record on Scripture suggests we deserve a big fat goose egg.
    \ \r\n\r\nSchool Chaplains \r\n\r\nDoes School Chaplaincy do any better? \r\n\r\nSchool
    chaplaincy has been generously funded by the Federal government since the days
    of John Howard. Rudd and then Gillard have since fallen over themselves â\x80\x93
    the latter even pre-empting the findings of a much-needed review of the program
    â\x80\x93 to shower Chaplaincy Service Providers with funds. By rough estimates,
    some 437 million of taxpayer dollars. \r\n \r\nOn might argue that the National
    School Chaplaincy Program shows all is well with Australiaâ\x80\x99s special brand
    of inclusive secularism because theoretically religious folk of all persuasions,
    not just Christians, can serve in the role. However, the notion of inclusiveness
    becomes problematic when you realise that â\x80\x93 in what appears to be a clear
    violation of the prohibitions on religious tests for jobs found in sec 116 of
    the constitution - a person of no faith cannot serve as a school chaplain. As
    well, the reality of the chaplaincy program â\x80\x93 how itâ\x80\x99s administered,
    funded and the facts on the ground â\x80\x93 conclusively demonstrate its failure
    to deliver any of the key promises of the secular state. No religious freedom.
    No religious fairness. No state neutrality with regard to religion\r\n\r\nWhy
    is this so? Because possibility aside, the reality is that 98 per cent of Australian
    chaplains are Christians â\x80\x93 a figure that matches up poorly with the 62
    per cent of Australians who identify as such. And, as we saw with scripture, these
    not your garden-variety Christians, but the crusading fundamentalist sort provided
    by â\x80\x93 you guessed it â\x80\x93 ACCESS Ministries and Scripture Union. Both
    ACCESS and Scripture Union are clear that they see chaplaincy as a means by which
    they can fulfil their mission to â\x80\x93 and here Iâ\x80\x99m quoting Scripture
    Union - â\x80\x9Cmake Godâ\x80\x99s Good News known to children [and] young peopleâ\x80\x9D
    so â\x80\x9Cthey may come to personal faith in our Lord Jesus Christâ\x80¦and
    becomeâ\x80¦committed church members.â\x80\x9D That chaplains are all about bringing
    lost Christian and non-Christian lambs into the evangelical flock is also suggested
    by the fact that three-quarters of the NSCP funds are spent in secular state schools.\r\n\r\nIndeed,
    while chaplains are officially prohibited from proselytising or counselling children,
    a damning report on the program and a RN Background Briefing provide clear evidence
    that some of them do. They also show that despite having no qualifications to
    counsel anyone - little less children with eating disorders, substance abuse problems,
    suffering physical or mental abuse, caring for a parent with disabilities or at
    risk of suicide - some get stuck-in anyway. As well, most fail to refer when â\x80\x93
    as is nearly always the case â\x80\x93 they are out of their depth. Such problems
    are not teething ones, nor those that can be overcome by better guidelines or
    training, but are a reflection of the inherent contraction resulting from the
    placement of individuals into pastoral care roles who have no qualification in
    anything other than evangelical Christianity. For if it is true, as the programâ\x80\x99s
    vested interest defenders claim, that chaplains provide a much-needed listening
    ear, knee bandaging and sausage sizzling services, why must one be a person of
    religious faith to qualify for the role? \r\n\r\nWith chaplains, opt-out is impossible,
    rather than simply complex and convoluted as is the case with Scripture. This
    is because a school chaplain is free to roam an entire school, and to interact
    with children of whatever age whenever, wherever and however s/he wants. This
    places parents who know about the chaplain â\x80\x93 and many donâ\x80\x99t â\x80\x93
    and wish to restrict his/her access to their child â\x80\x93 and some do - in
    an invidious position. Invidious because to achieve this would require banning
    their children from participating in crazy hair day where the gold coin goes to
    Scripture Union, from attending morning assembly where the chaplain does a rap
    about how much more trustworthy he is compared to the studentâ\x80\x99s teachers,
    from the schoolyard at lunchtime and recess where the chaplain organizes games
    or a sausage sizzle and from school camps on which the chaplain tags along. \r\n\r\nThat
    all this is happening in a compulsory school system in which non-religious alternatives
    in the private sector are as scarce as henâ\x80\x99s teeth â\x80\x93 even if they
    could be afforded by those currently sending their kids to public school â\x80\x93
    means that again, on the score card for inclusive secularism in action, Australia
    gets a zero. \r\n\r\nWeâ\x80\x99re not doing secularism differently; weâ\x80\x99re
    doing it badly. What we are doing â\x80\x93 as the Scripture and Chaplaincy examples
    show â\x80\x93 is allowing the already grey line between church and state to be
    overrun time and time again by a rapacious, crusading, intolerant majority and
    to do this to the detriment of those we love the most and to whom we owe the most
    sacred duty of care â\x80\x93 our children. \r\n\r\n*Part III: Fighting Back*\r\n\r\nSo
    how are we going to fight back? \r\n\r\nAlready fights on several fronts are up
    and running. Ron Williams is leading the charge, with great minds including Max
    Wallace behind him, in the High Court Challenge to the National School Chaplaincy
    Program. There is also a case before the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human
    Rights Commission by three parents claiming special religious education is discriminatory.
    \r\n\r\nThese are great initiatives, but they are not enough. We need to inform
    the community and get them involved via the web in the lobbying of our political
    leaders for change. \r\n\r\nTo do this, my observation of those advocating for
    secularism is not that they need to work harder, but that they need to work smarter.
    To work smarter not just when it comes to technology but when working with one
    another, and building coalitions with those who are different, but share an interest
    in defending a secular state. \r\n\r\nWanting to Win\r\n\r\nThe most important
    thing to make that happen is to want to win. Humanist, atheist and secular organizations
    can exist for a number of reasons, birds of feather liking to socialize together,
    to ensure visibility, etc. However, only groups that have a clear, discrete and
    realistic political agenda that they want to achieve more than anything have any
    chance of prevailing. \r\n\r\nI say this from experience. I was part of coalition
    of many groups and individuals that managed to change Victoriaâ\x80\x99s law on
    abortion. Around since the late 1800s, it had been defining the reproductive choices
    of Victorian women as crimes worthy of jail for more than one hundred years and
    was beloved by many. \r\n\r\nBut we did it and the way we did it was to work in
    coalition. When I say coalition, I mean thousands of individuals, dozens of groups
    that sometimes had history with one another and often disagreed. Many of us knew
    each other and as is the way with such things, didnâ\x80\x99t always get along.
    But that abortion needed to be removed from the Crimes Act â\x80\x93 now â\x80\x93
    was the one thing we were all passionate about, and agreed should be the focus
    of our activism. \r\n\r\nFormer Vic Premier Joan Kirner told us that in all her
    years of observing and being part of community campaigns she had never seen one
    work as effectively or as collaboratively as the one to decriminalize abortion.
    This was because everyone involved â\x80\x93 everyone - put their egos, their
    grievances, their personal dislikes, their pursuit of their organisationâ\x80\x99s
    interests, including being named and noted for their role in the effort, to one
    side. Instead, we were generous with one another, worked together productively
    come hell or high water â\x80\x93 at times stepping in, at others shutting up
    and getting out of the way â\x80\x93 to achieve our shared goal of making the
    lives of Victorian women better by changing the law. \r\n\r\nAustralian secularists
    can do this, and must do this, in order to change things on the SRE and Chaplaincy
    front for our children, and for all the young people in this state. \r\n\r\nAtheism,
    Humanism and Rationalism are not Secularism\r\n\r\nMany of the founders of secularism
    were religious. Indeed, back in the days when unbelief almost certainly existed
    but was not mentioned in polite company, it was often religious minorities afraid
    of being overrun by the majority who fought for a secular system of government
    that would give them religious freedom and protect them religious discrimination.
    When I was growing up, it was the Jews in my town who fought the yearly attempt
    by Christians to erect a nativity scene in the town square at Christmas time.
    \r\n\r\nWe need to remember this and to understand that we cannot win and will
    not win until we stop saying or insinuating that atheists, humanists or are the
    only ones who came up with the secular concept. Or that atheists, humanists or
    rationalist are the only ones able or willing to defend it. Atheism is a personal
    belief system. Humanism is a philosophy. Rationalism is an epistemology or theory.
    Secularism is a form of governance designed to ensure that Australians of every
    and of no faith are free to live their lives and to raise their children in accordance
    with their beliefs, and to not miss out on lifeâ\x80\x99s opportunities because
    of their personal faith. Who can, does and should support a secular state? Fair-minded
    Australians of all faiths and of none, thatâ\x80\x99s who. \r\n\r\nI want to end
    with a quote from an editorial in The Age about what the secular agenda when it
    comes to children is all about which â\x80\x93 in a nutshell â\x80\x93 is about
    getting trained professional educators to provide our kids with general religious
    education: \r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CThe solution is not to abandon education about religion;
    events of the past decade illustrate the dangers of religious ignorance and intolerance.
    However, the government should not rely on faith-driven volunteers instead of
    trained educators who teach to the same professional standards as in any other
    subject. The goal must not be to convert children but to ensure they have the
    general religious literacy they need to make sense of the past, present and future.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIn
    Closingâ\x80¦\r\n\r\nWe all owe where we arrive to where we have come from. When
    the Abortion Law Reform Bill passed through the Senate in October 2009 and became
    law, we were ecstatic. Rightly we gave thanks to the cross-party band of MPs who
    had made the billâ\x80\x99s passage, with not a single amendment, possible. \r\n\r\nI
    will never forget what Liberal Senator Andrea Coote said to me when I thanked
    her. \r\n\r\nShe said, â\x80\x9CLeslie, this has been a marathon. You women in
    the community have been running this race for a long time. We just took the baton
    and ran the final lap.â\x80\x9D \r\n\r\nMost of the people in this room have been
    striving to secure a secular state for a long time. I have little doubt that eventually
    we will prevail in this struggle. And when we do it wonâ\x80\x99t matter who is
    actually gripping the baton in their fist. The victory will be a collective one,
    in part owed to the hard work and persistence of all of you. \r\n\r\nEND\r\n"

    Separation Between Church and State</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Part 1 Australiaâ\x80\x99s
    Inclusive Approach to the Secular State</em></p>\n\n<p>Now if Max Wallace were
    here I could hear him muttering under his breath that unlike the US, Australia
    doesnâ\x80\x99t really have a separation of church and state. This is because
    &ndash; despite the wording of Sec 116 in the Oz constitution being more or less

    inclusive approach to the secular state is an inherently flawed approach, doomed
    to failure. Having examined this concept from every angle, held it up to the light,
    examined every possibility â\x80\x93 sound like someone we know? â\x80\x93 I struggle

    and leads to, hereâ\x80\x99s a quote from the recently released Australian Human
    Rights Commissionâ\x80\x99s look at Freedom of Religion and Belief in 21st Century
    Australia. The quote is from the Gospel Assembly of Melbourne. The Gospel Assembly
    told the studyâ\x80\x99s authors that:</p>\n\n<p>â\x80\x9CThe Australian government
    is obligated to respect the Christian religion as its first and foremost responsibility.
    We object to the idea that other religions are equal to the worship of Almighty
    God \"</p>\n\n<p>This quote doesnâ\x80\x99t just show us what intolerance looks
    like, it points to where it leads. Where it leads, as the Assembly makes clear,
    is to a view that because the Assemblyâ\x80\x99s Christian worldview is correct,
    this view and the policy prescriptions that fall out of it, should rightfully
    be privileged above all others in the community. Indeed, so right are they that
    they should be enshrined in laws that govern all of us, even those who are not
    members of the Christian flock, or any religious flock at all. Oops, there goes
    the secular state.</p>\n\n<p>Now, having once been an undergraduate student of
    psychology, I am aware that those who are truly confident of their truths donâ\x80\x99t
    necessarily feel compelled to put their views into forms that command others not
    compelled by them must obey. However, for those who lack such confidence, there
    is a compulsion to proselytize. This is because converting others provides external
    proof of the truth of oneâ\x80\x99s case, as in â\x80\x9Clook how many people
    agree with me, I must be right!â\x80\x9D Thus, for the fundamentalist who, intolerant
    by brand is insecure by nature, the tolerant and inclusive multi-faith space is
    one they are compelled to colonise as a means to their own end and by so doing,
    of course, devour secularism in the process.</p>\n\n<p>An example of this with
    which we are all familiar with is the misuse by Muslim jihadists of the freedom
    of speech and religious tolerance found in western democracies to spread their
    own violently intolerant ideologies. My point here is not to suggest that this
    modus operandi is not morally repugnant and a real cause for alarm â\x80\x93 it
    is â\x80\x93 but to point out that in Australia the risks it poses emanate primarily
    from evangelical Christian fundamentalists, not jihadist Muslims.</p>\n\n<p><em>Part
    II: Practical Problems with Inclusive Secularism</em></p>\n\n<p>So now that weâ\x80\x99ve
    looked at the inherent problems with any sort of inclusive Oz approach to the
    secular state, I want to turn to the consequences of this approach. To ask, if
    what weâ\x80\x99ve got is an inclusive secular state, how itâ\x80\x99s working?
    To do this I want to look at two programs currently running in Australian government
    schools that the founding fathers intended to be, and indeed are still believed
    to be, free, compulsory and secular by nature. Those two programs are Special
    Religious Education or â\x80\x9CScriptureâ\x80\x9D Classes and School Chaplaincy.</p>\n\n<p>Scripture</p>\n\n<p>319,305
    Victorian children attend scripture classes. The law requires these to be delivered
    by volunteers. 96% of whom are provided by ACCESS Ministries. ACCESS is an umbrella
    group representing 12 Christian denominations, including the Anglicans Church
    of Australia, Uniting Church, Lutheran Church of Australia and the Salvation Army.
    Parents of prep children are deliberately NOT informed that their school is compelled
    to allow access to their children to any scripture provider that demands it, nor
    are they even necessarily told scripture classes will be a regular part of their
    childâ\x80\x99s school week and that they have the right to opt their children
    out.</p>\n\n<p>Should the process fail to deliver these key understandings â\x80\x93
    a process that is an insult to informed consent and the zealously-guarded right
    of the religious to have choice and control over their own childrenâ\x80\x99s
    education â\x80\x93 their five year old will wind up on a Christian scripture
    class by default. This, as I said, is something they may not become aware of until
    Jenny arrives home swearing that God loves her more than mummy or, as a Twitter
    follower from Victoria reported, that it rains when God is angry.</p>\n\n<p>ACCESS
    Ministries is the only Victoria â\x80\x9Cscripture providerâ\x80\x9D that receives
    government funding. Indeed, only a few weeks ago the Victorian Education Minister
    Martin Dixon lobbed an additional $200,000 of taxpayer funds at ACCESS to improve
    volunteer training. This was on top of the more than $516,000 they already get
    from taxpayers, and a funding decision about which a Buddhist community leader,
    interviewed by The Ageâ\x80\x99s Michael Bachelard complained bitterly. The Buddhists
    provide scripture teachers to just 14 Victorian schools. Because they donâ\x80\x99t
    get government funding, they simply cannot afford to do more. Said Dr Sue Smith,
    â\x80\x9C'There is definitely a funding bias. Ours is funded by volunteers and
    donations.&lsquo;&rsquo;</p>\n\n<p>Children whose parents opt them out either
    because they have no faith, are of a minority faith not able to be catered for
    or who are appalled at the ACCESS curricula, experience discrimination. Separated
    from their classmates to endure enforced idleness â\x80\x93 the education department
    guidelines forbid any secular instruction to be offered when SRE classes are on
    â\x80\x93 young children can understand the sorting process as punishment. This
    is particularly the case when they are placed outside of the principalâ\x80\x99s
    office, by the photocopying machine or in a broom closet for what we are told
    are supervisory purposes and no, about the broom closet, Iâ\x80\x99m not kidding.</p>\n\n<p>Now
    one defence to those prosecuting the â\x80\x9CAustralia-does-secularism-differentlyâ\x80\x9D
    argument might be that while kids are admittedly being corralled into Christian
    scripture classes delivered by ACCESS Ministries volunteers, thatâ\x80\x99s OK.
    Why? Because the ACCESS curriculum is inclusive and tolerant. It teaches about
    all the worldâ\x80\x99s religions and thatâ\x80\x99s something important for kids
    to understand so they can develop tolerance. Yep, I couldnâ\x80\x99t agree more.
    General Religious Education is a terrific thing, but sadly General Religious Education
    is something entirely different to what ACCESS and other volunteers are delivering
    in the Special Religious Education spot. What ACCESS is doing is instructing kids
    in the beliefs and practices of a particular religion. In fact, the ACCESS curriculum
    is very much in line with their mission statement, which reads as follows:</p>\n\n<p>â\x80\x9COur
    vision is to reach every student in Victoria with the Gospel. Join the vision
    and help us transform this nation for God.â\x80\x9D</p>\n\n<p>This mission statement
    is similar to that of the other major scripture teacher provider, Scripture Union,
    which describes itself as, â\x80\x9CChristâ\x80\x99s ambassadors on the front
    line of ministry.â\x80\x9D</p>\n\n<p>On the score card for inclusive secularism
    in action, Australiaâ\x80\x99s record on Scripture suggests we deserve a big fat
    goose egg.</p>\n\n<p>School Chaplains</p>\n\n<p>Does School Chaplaincy do any
    better?</p>\n\n<p>School chaplaincy has been generously funded by the Federal
    government since the days of John Howard. Rudd and then Gillard have since fallen
    over themselves â\x80\x93 the latter even pre-empting the findings of a much-needed
    review of the program â\x80\x93 to shower Chaplaincy Service Providers with funds.
    By rough estimates, some 437 million of taxpayer dollars.</p>\n\n<p>On might argue
    that the National School Chaplaincy Program shows all is well with Australiaâ\x80\x99s
    special brand of inclusive secularism because theoretically religious folk of
    all persuasions, not just Christians, can serve in the role. However, the notion
    of inclusiveness becomes problematic when you realise that â\x80\x93 in what appears
    to be a clear violation of the prohibitions on religious tests for jobs found
    in sec 116 of the constitution &ndash; a person of no faith cannot serve as a
    school chaplain. As well, the reality of the chaplaincy program â\x80\x93 how
    itâ\x80\x99s administered, funded and the facts on the ground â\x80\x93 conclusively
    demonstrate its failure to deliver any of the key promises of the secular state.
    No religious freedom. No religious fairness. No state neutrality with regard to
    religion</p>\n\n<p>Why is this so? Because possibility aside, the reality is that
    98 per cent of Australian chaplains are Christians â\x80\x93 a figure that matches
    up poorly with the 62 per cent of Australians who identify as such. And, as we
    saw with scripture, these not your garden-variety Christians, but the crusading
    fundamentalist sort provided by â\x80\x93 you guessed it â\x80\x93 ACCESS Ministries
    and Scripture Union. Both ACCESS and Scripture Union are clear that they see chaplaincy
    as a means by which they can fulfil their mission to â\x80\x93 and here Iâ\x80\x99m
    quoting Scripture Union &ndash; â\x80\x9Cmake Godâ\x80\x99s Good News known to
    children [and] young peopleâ\x80\x9D so â\x80\x9Cthey may come to personal faith
    in our Lord Jesus Christâ\x80¦and becomeâ\x80¦committed church members.â\x80\x9D
    That chaplains are all about bringing lost Christian and non-Christian lambs into
    the evangelical flock is also suggested by the fact that three-quarters of the
    NSCP funds are spent in secular state schools.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, while chaplains
    are officially prohibited from proselytising or counselling children, a damning
    report on the program and a RN Background Briefing provide clear evidence that
    some of them do. They also show that despite having no qualifications to counsel
    anyone &ndash; little less children with eating disorders, substance abuse problems,
    suffering physical or mental abuse, caring for a parent with disabilities or at
    risk of suicide &ndash; some get stuck-in anyway. As well, most fail to refer
    when â\x80\x93 as is nearly always the case â\x80\x93 they are out of their depth.
    Such problems are not teething ones, nor those that can be overcome by better
    guidelines or training, but are a reflection of the inherent contraction resulting
    from the placement of individuals into pastoral care roles who have no qualification
    in anything other than evangelical Christianity. For if it is true, as the programâ\x80\x99s
    vested interest defenders claim, that chaplains provide a much-needed listening
    ear, knee bandaging and sausage sizzling services, why must one be a person of
    religious faith to qualify for the role?</p>\n\n<p>With chaplains, opt-out is
    impossible, rather than simply complex and convoluted as is the case with Scripture.
    This is because a school chaplain is free to roam an entire school, and to interact
    with children of whatever age whenever, wherever and however s/he wants. This
    places parents who know about the chaplain â\x80\x93 and many donâ\x80\x99t â\x80\x93
    and wish to restrict his/her access to their child â\x80\x93 and some do &ndash;
    in an invidious position. Invidious because to achieve this would require banning
    their children from participating in crazy hair day where the gold coin goes to
    Scripture Union, from attending morning assembly where the chaplain does a rap
    about how much more trustworthy he is compared to the studentâ\x80\x99s teachers,
    from the schoolyard at lunchtime and recess where the chaplain organizes games
    or a sausage sizzle and from school camps on which the chaplain tags along.</p>\n\n<p>That
    all this is happening in a compulsory school system in which non-religious alternatives
    in the private sector are as scarce as henâ\x80\x99s teeth â\x80\x93 even if they
    could be afforded by those currently sending their kids to public school â\x80\x93
    means that again, on the score card for inclusive secularism in action, Australia
    gets a zero.</p>\n\n<p>Weâ\x80\x99re not doing secularism differently; weâ\x80\x99re
    doing it badly. What we are doing â\x80\x93 as the Scripture and Chaplaincy examples
    show â\x80\x93 is allowing the already grey line between church and state to be
    overrun time and time again by a rapacious, crusading, intolerant majority and
    to do this to the detriment of those we love the most and to whom we owe the most
    sacred duty of care â\x80\x93 our children.</p>\n\n<p><em>Part III: Fighting Back</em></p>\n\n<p>So
    how are we going to fight back?</p>\n\n<p>Already fights on several fronts are
    up and running. Ron Williams is leading the charge, with great minds including
    Max Wallace behind him, in the High Court Challenge to the National School Chaplaincy
    Program. There is also a case before the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human
    Rights Commission by three parents claiming special religious education is discriminatory.</p>\n\n<p>These
    are great initiatives, but they are not enough. We need to inform the community
    and get them involved via the web in the lobbying of our political leaders for
    change.</p>\n\n<p>To do this, my observation of those advocating for secularism
    is not that they need to work harder, but that they need to work smarter. To work
    smarter not just when it comes to technology but when working with one another,
    and building coalitions with those who are different, but share an interest in
    defending a secular state.</p>\n\n<p>Wanting to Win</p>\n\n<p>The most important
    thing to make that happen is to want to win. Humanist, atheist and secular organizations
    can exist for a number of reasons, birds of feather liking to socialize together,
    to ensure visibility, etc. However, only groups that have a clear, discrete and
    realistic political agenda that they want to achieve more than anything have any
    chance of prevailing.</p>\n\n<p>I say this from experience. I was part of coalition
    of many groups and individuals that managed to change Victoriaâ\x80\x99s law on
    abortion. Around since the late 1800s, it had been defining the reproductive choices
    of Victorian women as crimes worthy of jail for more than one hundred years and
    was beloved by many.</p>\n\n<p>But we did it and the way we did it was to work
    in coalition. When I say coalition, I mean thousands of individuals, dozens of
    groups that sometimes had history with one another and often disagreed. Many of
    us knew each other and as is the way with such things, didnâ\x80\x99t always get
    along. But that abortion needed to be removed from the Crimes Act â\x80\x93 now
    â\x80\x93 was the one thing we were all passionate about, and agreed should be
    the focus of our activism.</p>\n\n<p>Former Vic Premier Joan Kirner told us that
    in all her years of observing and being part of community campaigns she had never
    seen one work as effectively or as collaboratively as the one to decriminalize
    abortion. This was because everyone involved â\x80\x93 everyone &ndash; put their
    egos, their grievances, their personal dislikes, their pursuit of their organisationâ\x80\x99s
    interests, including being named and noted for their role in the effort, to one
    side. Instead, we were generous with one another, worked together productively
    come hell or high water â\x80\x93 at times stepping in, at others shutting up
    and getting out of the way â\x80\x93 to achieve our shared goal of making the
    lives of Victorian women better by changing the law.</p>\n\n<p>Australian secularists
    can do this, and must do this, in order to change things on the SRE and Chaplaincy
    front for our children, and for all the young people in this state.</p>\n\n<p>Atheism,
    Humanism and Rationalism are not Secularism</p>\n\n<p>Many of the founders of
    secularism were religious. Indeed, back in the days when unbelief almost certainly
    existed but was not mentioned in polite company, it was often religious minorities
    afraid of being overrun by the majority who fought for a secular system of government
    that would give them religious freedom and protect them religious discrimination.
    When I was growing up, it was the Jews in my town who fought the yearly attempt
    by Christians to erect a nativity scene in the town square at Christmas time.</p>\n\n<p>We
    need to remember this and to understand that we cannot win and will not win until
    we stop saying or insinuating that atheists, humanists or are the only ones who
    came up with the secular concept. Or that atheists, humanists or rationalist are
    the only ones able or willing to defend it. Atheism is a personal belief system.
    Humanism is a philosophy. Rationalism is an epistemology or theory. Secularism
    is a form of governance designed to ensure that Australians of every and of no
    faith are free to live their lives and to raise their children in accordance with
    their beliefs, and to not miss out on lifeâ\x80\x99s opportunities because of
    their personal faith. Who can, does and should support a secular state? Fair-minded
    Australians of all faiths and of none, thatâ\x80\x99s who.</p>\n\n<p>I want to
    end with a quote from an editorial in The Age about what the secular agenda when
    it comes to children is all about which â\x80\x93 in a nutshell â\x80\x93 is about
    getting trained professional educators to provide our kids with general religious
    education:</p>\n\n<p>â\x80\x9CThe solution is not to abandon education about religion;
    events of the past decade illustrate the dangers of religious ignorance and intolerance.
    However, the government should not rely on faith-driven volunteers instead of
    trained educators who teach to the same professional standards as in any other
    subject. The goal must not be to convert children but to ensure they have the
    general religious literacy they need to make sense of the past, present and future.â\x80\x9D</p>\n\n<p>In
    Closingâ\x80¦</p>\n\n<p>We all owe where we arrive to where we have come from.
    When the Abortion Law Reform Bill passed through the Senate in October 2009 and
    became law, we were ecstatic. Rightly we gave thanks to the cross-party band of
    MPs who had made the billâ\x80\x99s passage, with not a single amendment, possible.</p>\n\n<p>I
    will never forget what Liberal Senator Andrea Coote said to me when I thanked
    her.</p>\n\n<p>She said, â\x80\x9CLeslie, this has been a marathon. You women
    in the community have been running this race for a long time. We just took the
    baton and ran the final lap.â\x80\x9D</p>\n\n<p>Most of the people in this room
    have been striving to secure a secular state for a long time. I have little doubt
    that eventually we will prevail in this struggle. And when we do it wonâ\x80\x99t
    matter who is actually gripping the baton in their fist. The victory will be a
    collective one, in part owed to the hard work and persistence of all of you.</p>\n\n<p>END</p>\n"

title: 'Leslie made 2011 Australian Humanist of the Year '
--- "In selecting Leslie Cannold for this yearâ\x80\x99s award, The Council of Australian
  Humanist Societies are expressing their admiration for Leslieâ\x80\x99s forthright
  views on such controversial issues as advocacy of abortion rights for women, family
  planning and access to assisted reproductive technologies.\r\n\r\nLeslie was presented
  with her AHOY award at a dinner on Saturday 30 April 2011. The citation says, \"In
  recognition of her outstanding contribution to public debate on bio-ethics, especially
  issues affecting women and family life. she excels at presenting complex and controversial
  ideas with clarity. She is much appreciated by thinking people as a beacon of the
  well informed, reasoned argument in the media sea of misinformation.\" \r\n\r\nLeslie's
  acceptance speech was covered by [The Age](http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/push-to-kick-religion-out-of-schools-20110430-1e234.html).
  \r\n\r\nExcerpts were broadcast on Radio National's [Big Ideas](http://www.abc.net.au/rn/bigideas/stories/2011/3214059.htm).\r\n\r\nRead
  it below:\r\n\r\n**Australiaâ\x80\x99s Fading Separation Between Church and State**\r\n\r\n*Part
  1 Australiaâ\x80\x99s Inclusive Approach to the Secular State*\r\n\r\nNow if Max
  Wallace were here I could hear him muttering under his breath that unlike the US,
  Australia doesnâ\x80\x99t really have a separation of church and state. This is
  because - despite the wording of Sec 116 in the Oz constitution being more or less
  the same as that found in the US one   - the Australian courts have interpreted
  the provision narrowly and so a clear line has never been drawn.  \r\n\r\nNow while
  some see this as a failure, others protest. They say that itâ\x80\x99s not that
  Australia doesnâ\x80\x99t do secularism, itâ\x80\x99s just that we do it differently.
  Not worse, not better, just differently to how itâ\x80\x99s done in the USA or in
  France. \r\n\r\nThese folks say that rather than bar religion from the public square,
  Australia has an inclusive approach that delivers religious freedom, religious fairness
  and state neutrality with regard to religion by allowing all faiths equal access
  to the public square. Those of no faith, as is usual with such things, are rarely
  mentioned. \r\n\r\nMy response to this is to say well, if that is true â\x80\x93
  if Australia does the secular state in a unique an inclusive manner â\x80\x93 than
  this approach is fatally flawed and has proved to be a miserable failure. A miserable
  failure. \r\n\r\nPrincipled Problem with Inclusive Secularism\r\n\r\nAn inclusive
  approach to the secular state is an inherently flawed approach, doomed to failure.
  Having examined this concept from every angle, held it up to the light, examined
  every possibility â\x80\x93 sound like someone we know? â\x80\x93 I struggle to
  see how it could ever work. Because whatever the denomination, a fundamentalist
  approach to religious texts and truths makes one intolerant and disrespectful of
  difference. There are always fundamentalists, and they are always intolerant and
  disrespectful of difference. Why? Because they believe they have sole access to
  the truth and, by virtue of this, that those who disagree with them are just plain
  wrong.\r\n\r\nTo give you a feel for what such intolerance looks like and leads
  to, hereâ\x80\x99s a quote from the recently released Australian Human Rights Commissionâ\x80\x99s
  look at Freedom of Religion and Belief in 21st Century Australia. The quote is from
  the Gospel Assembly of Melbourne. The Gospel Assembly told the studyâ\x80\x99s authors
  that: \r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CThe Australian government is obligated to respect the Christian
  religion as its first and foremost responsibility. We object to the idea that other
  religions are equal to the worship of Almighty God \"\r\n\r\nThis quote doesnâ\x80\x99t
  just show us what intolerance looks like, it points to where it leads. Where it
  leads, as the Assembly makes clear, is to a view that because the Assemblyâ\x80\x99s
  Christian worldview is correct, this view and the policy prescriptions that fall
  out of it, should rightfully be privileged above all others in the community. Indeed,
  so right are they that they should be enshrined in laws that govern all of us, even
  those who are not members of the Christian flock, or any religious flock at all.
  Oops, there goes the secular state. \r\n\r\nNow, having once been an undergraduate
  student of psychology, I am aware that those who are truly confident of their truths
  donâ\x80\x99t necessarily feel compelled to put their views into forms that command
  others not compelled by them must obey. However, for those who lack such confidence,
  there is a compulsion to proselytize. This is because converting others provides
  external proof of the truth of oneâ\x80\x99s case, as in â\x80\x9Clook how many
  people agree with me, I must be right!â\x80\x9D Thus, for the fundamentalist who,
  intolerant by brand is insecure by nature, the tolerant and inclusive multi-faith
  space is one they are compelled to colonise as a means to their own end and by so
  doing, of course, devour secularism in the process. \r\n\r\nAn example of this with
  which we are all familiar with is the misuse by Muslim jihadists of the freedom
  of speech and religious tolerance found in western democracies to spread their own
  violently intolerant ideologies. My point here is not to suggest that this modus
  operandi is not morally repugnant and a real cause for alarm â\x80\x93 it is â\x80\x93
  but to point out that in Australia the risks it poses emanate primarily from evangelical
  Christian fundamentalists, not jihadist Muslims. \r\n\r\n*Part II: Practical Problems
  with Inclusive Secularism*\r\n\r\nSo now that weâ\x80\x99ve looked at the inherent
  problems with any sort of inclusive Oz approach to the secular state, I want to
  turn to the consequences of this approach. To ask, if what weâ\x80\x99ve got is
  an inclusive secular state, how itâ\x80\x99s working? To do this I want to look
  at two programs currently running in Australian government schools that the founding
  fathers intended to be, and indeed are still believed to be, free, compulsory and
  secular by nature. Those two programs are Special Religious Education or â\x80\x9CScriptureâ\x80\x9D
  Classes and School Chaplaincy. \r\n\r\nScripture\r\n\r\n319,305 Victorian children
  attend scripture classes. The law requires these to be delivered by volunteers.
  96% of whom are provided by ACCESS Ministries. ACCESS is an umbrella group representing
  12 Christian denominations, including the Anglicans Church of Australia, Uniting
  Church, Lutheran Church of Australia and the Salvation Army. Parents of prep children
  are deliberately NOT informed that their school is compelled to allow access to
  their children to any scripture provider that demands it, nor are they even necessarily
  told scripture classes will be a regular part of their childâ\x80\x99s school week
  and that they have the right to opt their children out. \r\n\r\nShould the process
  fail to deliver these key understandings â\x80\x93 a process that is an insult to
  informed consent and the zealously-guarded right of the religious to have choice
  and control over their own childrenâ\x80\x99s education â\x80\x93 their five year
  old will wind up on a Christian scripture class by default. This, as I said, is
  something they may not become aware of until Jenny arrives home swearing that God
  loves her more than mummy or, as a Twitter follower from Victoria reported, that
  it rains when God is angry. \r\n\r\nACCESS Ministries is the only Victoria â\x80\x9Cscripture
  providerâ\x80\x9D that receives government funding. Indeed, only a few weeks ago
  the Victorian Education Minister Martin Dixon lobbed an additional $200,000 of taxpayer
  funds at ACCESS to improve volunteer training. This was on top of the more than
  $516,000 they already get from taxpayers, and a funding decision about which a Buddhist
  community leader, interviewed by The Ageâ\x80\x99s Michael Bachelard complained
  bitterly. The Buddhists provide scripture teachers to just 14 Victorian schools.
  Because they donâ\x80\x99t get government funding, they simply cannot afford to
  do more. Said Dr Sue Smith, â\x80\x9C'There is definitely a funding bias. Ours is
  funded by volunteers and donations.'' \r\n\r\nChildren whose parents opt them out
  either because they have no faith, are of a minority faith not able to be catered
  for or who are appalled at the ACCESS curricula, experience discrimination. Separated
  from their classmates to endure enforced idleness â\x80\x93 the education department
  guidelines forbid any secular instruction to be offered when SRE classes are on
  â\x80\x93 young children can understand the sorting process as punishment. This
  is particularly the case when they are placed outside of the principalâ\x80\x99s
  office, by the photocopying machine or in a broom closet for what we are told are
  supervisory purposes and no, about the broom closet, Iâ\x80\x99m not kidding. \r\n\r\nNow
  one defence to those prosecuting the â\x80\x9CAustralia-does-secularism-differentlyâ\x80\x9D
  argument might be that while kids are admittedly being corralled into Christian
  scripture classes delivered by ACCESS Ministries volunteers, thatâ\x80\x99s OK.
  Why? Because the ACCESS curriculum is inclusive and tolerant. It teaches about all
  the worldâ\x80\x99s religions and thatâ\x80\x99s something important for kids to
  understand so they can develop tolerance. Yep, I couldnâ\x80\x99t agree more. General
  Religious Education is a terrific thing, but sadly General Religious Education is
  something entirely different to what ACCESS and other volunteers are delivering
  in the Special Religious Education spot. What ACCESS is doing is instructing kids
  in the beliefs and practices of a particular religion. In fact, the ACCESS curriculum
  is very much in line with their mission statement, which reads as follows: \r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9COur
  vision is to reach every student in Victoria with the Gospel. Join the vision and
  help us transform this nation for God.â\x80\x9D \r\n\r\nThis mission statement is
  similar to that of the other major scripture teacher provider, Scripture Union,
  which describes itself as, â\x80\x9CChristâ\x80\x99s ambassadors on the front line
  of ministry.â\x80\x9D \r\n\r\nOn the score card for inclusive secularism in action,
  Australiaâ\x80\x99s record on Scripture suggests we deserve a big fat goose egg.
  \ \r\n\r\nSchool Chaplains \r\n\r\nDoes School Chaplaincy do any better? \r\n\r\nSchool
  chaplaincy has been generously funded by the Federal government since the days of
  John Howard. Rudd and then Gillard have since fallen over themselves â\x80\x93 the
  latter even pre-empting the findings of a much-needed review of the program â\x80\x93
  to shower Chaplaincy Service Providers with funds. By rough estimates, some 437
  million of taxpayer dollars. \r\n \r\nOn might argue that the National School Chaplaincy
  Program shows all is well with Australiaâ\x80\x99s special brand of inclusive secularism
  because theoretically religious folk of all persuasions, not just Christians, can
  serve in the role. However, the notion of inclusiveness becomes problematic when
  you realise that â\x80\x93 in what appears to be a clear violation of the prohibitions
  on religious tests for jobs found in sec 116 of the constitution - a person of no
  faith cannot serve as a school chaplain. As well, the reality of the chaplaincy
  program â\x80\x93 how itâ\x80\x99s administered, funded and the facts on the ground
  â\x80\x93 conclusively demonstrate its failure to deliver any of the key promises
  of the secular state. No religious freedom. No religious fairness. No state neutrality
  with regard to religion\r\n\r\nWhy is this so? Because possibility aside, the reality
  is that 98 per cent of Australian chaplains are Christians â\x80\x93 a figure that
  matches up poorly with the 62 per cent of Australians who identify as such. And,
  as we saw with scripture, these not your garden-variety Christians, but the crusading
  fundamentalist sort provided by â\x80\x93 you guessed it â\x80\x93 ACCESS Ministries
  and Scripture Union. Both ACCESS and Scripture Union are clear that they see chaplaincy
  as a means by which they can fulfil their mission to â\x80\x93 and here Iâ\x80\x99m
  quoting Scripture Union - â\x80\x9Cmake Godâ\x80\x99s Good News known to children
  [and] young peopleâ\x80\x9D so â\x80\x9Cthey may come to personal faith in our Lord
  Jesus Christâ\x80¦and becomeâ\x80¦committed church members.â\x80\x9D That chaplains
  are all about bringing lost Christian and non-Christian lambs into the evangelical
  flock is also suggested by the fact that three-quarters of the NSCP funds are spent
  in secular state schools.\r\n\r\nIndeed, while chaplains are officially prohibited
  from proselytising or counselling children, a damning report on the program and
  a RN Background Briefing provide clear evidence that some of them do. They also
  show that despite having no qualifications to counsel anyone - little less children
  with eating disorders, substance abuse problems, suffering physical or mental abuse,
  caring for a parent with disabilities or at risk of suicide - some get stuck-in
  anyway. As well, most fail to refer when â\x80\x93 as is nearly always the case
  â\x80\x93 they are out of their depth. Such problems are not teething ones, nor
  those that can be overcome by better guidelines or training, but are a reflection
  of the inherent contraction resulting from the placement of individuals into pastoral
  care roles who have no qualification in anything other than evangelical Christianity.
  For if it is true, as the programâ\x80\x99s vested interest defenders claim, that
  chaplains provide a much-needed listening ear, knee bandaging and sausage sizzling
  services, why must one be a person of religious faith to qualify for the role? \r\n\r\nWith
  chaplains, opt-out is impossible, rather than simply complex and convoluted as is
  the case with Scripture. This is because a school chaplain is free to roam an entire
  school, and to interact with children of whatever age whenever, wherever and however
  s/he wants. This places parents who know about the chaplain â\x80\x93 and many donâ\x80\x99t
  â\x80\x93 and wish to restrict his/her access to their child â\x80\x93 and some
  do - in an invidious position. Invidious because to achieve this would require banning
  their children from participating in crazy hair day where the gold coin goes to
  Scripture Union, from attending morning assembly where the chaplain does a rap about
  how much more trustworthy he is compared to the studentâ\x80\x99s teachers, from
  the schoolyard at lunchtime and recess where the chaplain organizes games or a sausage
  sizzle and from school camps on which the chaplain tags along. \r\n\r\nThat all
  this is happening in a compulsory school system in which non-religious alternatives
  in the private sector are as scarce as henâ\x80\x99s teeth â\x80\x93 even if they
  could be afforded by those currently sending their kids to public school â\x80\x93
  means that again, on the score card for inclusive secularism in action, Australia
  gets a zero. \r\n\r\nWeâ\x80\x99re not doing secularism differently; weâ\x80\x99re
  doing it badly. What we are doing â\x80\x93 as the Scripture and Chaplaincy examples
  show â\x80\x93 is allowing the already grey line between church and state to be
  overrun time and time again by a rapacious, crusading, intolerant majority and to
  do this to the detriment of those we love the most and to whom we owe the most sacred
  duty of care â\x80\x93 our children. \r\n\r\n*Part III: Fighting Back*\r\n\r\nSo
  how are we going to fight back? \r\n\r\nAlready fights on several fronts are up
  and running. Ron Williams is leading the charge, with great minds including Max
  Wallace behind him, in the High Court Challenge to the National School Chaplaincy
  Program. There is also a case before the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights
  Commission by three parents claiming special religious education is discriminatory.
  \r\n\r\nThese are great initiatives, but they are not enough. We need to inform
  the community and get them involved via the web in the lobbying of our political
  leaders for change. \r\n\r\nTo do this, my observation of those advocating for secularism
  is not that they need to work harder, but that they need to work smarter. To work
  smarter not just when it comes to technology but when working with one another,
  and building coalitions with those who are different, but share an interest in defending
  a secular state. \r\n\r\nWanting to Win\r\n\r\nThe most important thing to make
  that happen is to want to win. Humanist, atheist and secular organizations can exist
  for a number of reasons, birds of feather liking to socialize together, to ensure
  visibility, etc. However, only groups that have a clear, discrete and realistic
  political agenda that they want to achieve more than anything have any chance of
  prevailing. \r\n\r\nI say this from experience. I was part of coalition of many
  groups and individuals that managed to change Victoriaâ\x80\x99s law on abortion.
  Around since the late 1800s, it had been defining the reproductive choices of Victorian
  women as crimes worthy of jail for more than one hundred years and was beloved by
  many. \r\n\r\nBut we did it and the way we did it was to work in coalition. When
  I say coalition, I mean thousands of individuals, dozens of groups that sometimes
  had history with one another and often disagreed. Many of us knew each other and
  as is the way with such things, didnâ\x80\x99t always get along. But that abortion
  needed to be removed from the Crimes Act â\x80\x93 now â\x80\x93 was the one thing
  we were all passionate about, and agreed should be the focus of our activism. \r\n\r\nFormer
  Vic Premier Joan Kirner told us that in all her years of observing and being part
  of community campaigns she had never seen one work as effectively or as collaboratively
  as the one to decriminalize abortion. This was because everyone involved â\x80\x93
  everyone - put their egos, their grievances, their personal dislikes, their pursuit
  of their organisationâ\x80\x99s interests, including being named and noted for their
  role in the effort, to one side. Instead, we were generous with one another, worked
  together productively come hell or high water â\x80\x93 at times stepping in, at
  others shutting up and getting out of the way â\x80\x93 to achieve our shared goal
  of making the lives of Victorian women better by changing the law. \r\n\r\nAustralian
  secularists can do this, and must do this, in order to change things on the SRE
  and Chaplaincy front for our children, and for all the young people in this state.
  \r\n\r\nAtheism, Humanism and Rationalism are not Secularism\r\n\r\nMany of the
  founders of secularism were religious. Indeed, back in the days when unbelief almost
  certainly existed but was not mentioned in polite company, it was often religious
  minorities afraid of being overrun by the majority who fought for a secular system
  of government that would give them religious freedom and protect them religious
  discrimination. When I was growing up, it was the Jews in my town who fought the
  yearly attempt by Christians to erect a nativity scene in the town square at Christmas
  time. \r\n\r\nWe need to remember this and to understand that we cannot win and
  will not win until we stop saying or insinuating that atheists, humanists or are
  the only ones who came up with the secular concept. Or that atheists, humanists
  or rationalist are the only ones able or willing to defend it. Atheism is a personal
  belief system. Humanism is a philosophy. Rationalism is an epistemology or theory.
  Secularism is a form of governance designed to ensure that Australians of every
  and of no faith are free to live their lives and to raise their children in accordance
  with their beliefs, and to not miss out on lifeâ\x80\x99s opportunities because
  of their personal faith. Who can, does and should support a secular state? Fair-minded
  Australians of all faiths and of none, thatâ\x80\x99s who. \r\n\r\nI want to end
  with a quote from an editorial in The Age about what the secular agenda when it
  comes to children is all about which â\x80\x93 in a nutshell â\x80\x93 is about
  getting trained professional educators to provide our kids with general religious
  education: \r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CThe solution is not to abandon education about religion;
  events of the past decade illustrate the dangers of religious ignorance and intolerance.
  However, the government should not rely on faith-driven volunteers instead of trained
  educators who teach to the same professional standards as in any other subject.
  The goal must not be to convert children but to ensure they have the general religious
  literacy they need to make sense of the past, present and future.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIn
  Closingâ\x80¦\r\n\r\nWe all owe where we arrive to where we have come from. When
  the Abortion Law Reform Bill passed through the Senate in October 2009 and became
  law, we were ecstatic. Rightly we gave thanks to the cross-party band of MPs who
  had made the billâ\x80\x99s passage, with not a single amendment, possible. \r\n\r\nI
  will never forget what Liberal Senator Andrea Coote said to me when I thanked her.
  \r\n\r\nShe said, â\x80\x9CLeslie, this has been a marathon. You women in the community
  have been running this race for a long time. We just took the baton and ran the
  final lap.â\x80\x9D \r\n\r\nMost of the people in this room have been striving to
  secure a secular state for a long time. I have little doubt that eventually we will
  prevail in this struggle. And when we do it wonâ\x80\x99t matter who is actually
  gripping the baton in their fist. The victory will be a collective one, in part
  owed to the hard work and persistence of all of you. \r\n\r\nEND\r\n"
