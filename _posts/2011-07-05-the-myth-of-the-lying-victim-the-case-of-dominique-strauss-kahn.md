    In 2010, the Australia Bureau of Statistics (ABS) recorded 80 victims per 100,000.\r\n\r\nThis
    is significantly higher than the next two most common violent crimes - kidnapping/abduction
    and murder - that impact 3 and 1 Australians per 100,000, respectively.\r\n\r\nSexual
    assault figures become even more alarming when you remember that most sex crimes
    창\x80\x93 85 per cent in one recent Australian survey 창\x80\x93 are never reported.
    In Sweden the reported rate of sexual assault is twice as high as Australia (168
    sexual offences per 100,000). This higher rate may not indicate a greater incidence
    of sexual violence in Sweden, but an increased confidence among Swedish women
    that if they report sexual assault they will be believed and all efforts will
    be made by authorities to bring the accused to account.\r\n\r\nSome fear that
    the unravelling of the case against former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn (DSK)
    will undermine feminist efforts to reduce sexual violence. They worry that just
    as women are shedding the thousand-year taint of being unreliable legal witnesses
    and holding out hope that in a courtroom contest they might be the one a jury
    believes, the spectre of the lying rape victim rises again.\r\n\r\nLawyer and
    Fox News commentator Susan Estrich says that, \"the myth of the lying woman is
    the most powerful myth in the tradition of rape law\". The doubt about women's
    credibility was institutionalised in western law through the requirement that
    other witnesses must corroborate a woman's evidence. But while many western jurisdictions
    have abolished the corroboration requirement, trial judges sometimes may still
    give harsh warnings about the need for corroborating evidence to sustain a rape
    charge, often with the approval of appellate courts.\r\n\r\nIndeed, even where
    corroboration requirements have been eliminated, perceived problems with female
    credibility continue to contribute to low conviction rates. A study by Kathy Mack
    found that even in the select cases that make it to trial, conviction is rare,
    particularly where the victim and perpetrator know each other and there is no
    injury beyond the rape. In both the United States and Australia, convictions for
    rape are lower than for other serious crimes in part because juries insist on
    more corroboration than in trials involving other serious crimes, and typically
    see rape victims as less credible. A recent Australian study has found that being
    male, low income and politically conservative made a juror more likely to deem
    a rape victim as lacking credibility and the male accused as innocent.\r\n\r\nThe
    good news is that changes to sexual assault laws have seen a decline in the social
    acceptability of sexual violence. As women have come to be seen as credible witnesses
    in their own defence inside the courtroom, so have their testimonies about the
    fact and devastating consequences of sexual assault been taken more seriously
    beyond it. Today, a woman's allegation that a man forced her to have sex can seriously
    damage his reputation, private life and career. Fifty years ago the damage of
    such an allegation - would she ever have raised it - would largely have been done
    to her. Sure, the newfound pariah status of men alleged to have committed rape
    may partly be related to Christian wowserism and related judgementalism, but is
    also a reflection of a newfound and hard-won awareness that women have the right
    to decide if, when, how and with whom they have sex.\r\n\r\nIt's over-egging to
    view the credibility problems of the maid in the Strauss-Kahn case as providing
    proof of Kahn's innocence. The correct interpretation is that in a he said/she
    said case where the issue is not whether sex took place but whether it was consensual,
    the highly impeachable nature of her past will almost certainly lead a jury to
    see him as the more believable witness.\r\n\r\nFor some, this is the problem.
    They say that once a suspicion is raised, even where a case is dropped, the damage
    to the man's reputation is irrevocable. They call for all rape allegations to
    be shielded from public view, with the name of the man released only if he is
    convicted of the crime. Says philosopher apologist Bernard Henri Levy:\r\n\r\nI
    resent the New York tabloid press, a disgrace to the profession, that, without
    the least precaution and before having effected the least verification, has depicted
    Dominique Strauss-Kahn as a sicko, a pervert, border-lining on serial killer,
    a psychiatrist's dream.\r\n\r\nAccording to the somewhat melodramatic Levy, the
    affair won't be over until Strauss-Kahn is \"recognised as innocent, completely
    innocent - and re-established in [his] honour\".\r\n\r\nThe truth is that all
    crimes have false reporting rates and sexual assault is no different. Somewhere
    between 2 to 3 per cent of sexual assault accusations turn out to be malicious
    and false, which is about the same rate as other serious crimes. In Australia,
    in addition to the public exposure and humiliation to which a woman is exposed
    if she falsely claims rape, police will often charge her for making a false report.\r\n\r\nThis
    is as it should be. If women want to be taken seriously as credible witnesses
    on their own behalf, and as respect-worthy moral agents capable of offering and
    withholding consent, there must be zero tolerance for liars, however compelling
    their reasons for twisting the truth (who could forget Mayella Ewell in To Kill
    A Mockingbird?).\r\n\r\nHowever, if we are serious about holding men to account
    on rape, the shielding of those alleged to have committed a sexual crime from
    media reporting will not do. Already the conviction rate for sexual assault is
    extremely low compared to those for other violent crimes, with only one in 10
    reported incidents resulting in a guilty finding. The simple fact is that reporting
    of allegations in the press often leads to other victims coming forward, providing
    just the sort of corroboration that is necessary to bring rapists to book.\r\n\r\nEarlier
    this year Victorians learned of several sexual assault cases, including cases
    of alleged gang rapes involving children being pursued by Victoria Police and
    the Office of Public Prosecutions, being withdrawn or struck out.\r\n\r\nHowever
    sorry I feel for the handful of men falsely accused of sexual assault - and as
    the mother of two sons I do feel sorry - I feel just as badly for the far more
    plentiful women and children who are regularly told by prosecutors that their
    cases will not be proceeding because there's not enough evidence for a guilty
    verdict to be found.\r\n"
