  content: "Has anyone been listening to the lyrics of Eminem lately? The man is\r\nobsessed
    about the sexual morays of his lady friends. And women just\r\ncanâ\x80\x99t win
    with this guy. First he tells them that if they donâ\x80\x99t put out,\r\nheâ\x80\x99d
    going to â\x80\x9Cput them out,â\x80\x9D while in the next breath heâ\x80\x99s
    dismissing\r\nthem as beneath contempt for sleeping with him on the same day they
    met.\r\nThe rap superstar is also pretty direct about his lack of respect for\r\nwomen
    who offer to worship at his alter (if you get my drift) when all\r\nthey know
    about him is that heâ\x80\x99s lead singer of a band.\r\n\r\nIt sort of reminds
    me of the excuses being made for the male athletes\r\naccused of sexual assault:
    that when women keep throwing themselves at\r\nthem, what can you expect such
    virile blokes to do?\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s happening again. In the media and across
    popular entertainment,\r\nyoung women are being informed - in ways subtle and
    no so - that theyâ\x80\x99re\r\nacting like sluts. They are being told in no uncertain
    terms that if\r\nthey â\x80\x9Cgiveâ\x80\x9D sex to a guy just because heâ\x80\x99s
    the lead cock in the coop,\r\ntheyâ\x80\x99re â\x80\x9Cdissingâ\x80\x9D themselves.
    And if women lack respect for themselves,\r\nhow can they expect men will respect
    them.\r\n\r\nThe message seems to be that if young women are going to stay out
    late\r\nwith their skirts up to pussyâ\x80\x99s bow and their tongues hanging
    out, they\r\nshouldnâ\x80\x99t be surprised when all they find is trouble.\r\n\r\nHow
    fair is the slut charge? Itâ\x80\x99s certainly accurate to say that some\r\nyoung
    women engage in casual sex with high status men. Iâ\x80\x99ve got male\r\nfriends
    who are or have been musicians. The stories they tell about\r\ntheir female fans
    make Eminemâ\x80\x99s tales seem tame.\r\n\r\nBut if women cheapen themselves
    by having brief and loveless encounters\r\nwith men they donâ\x80\x99t know but
    are attracted to for superficial reasons,\r\nthen so do men. Whatâ\x80\x99s the
    difference between a woman who â\x80\x9Cgets withâ\x80\x9D a\r\nguy because heâ\x80\x99s
    high status, and a bloke bedding a woman because he\r\nlikes her breasts, her
    long legs or the winning way she laughs at his\r\nunfunny jokes. The bottom line,
    in other words, is that if young women\r\nare acting like sluts, then young men
    are too.\r\n\r\nThe real question is whether both sexes ought to be condemned
    for\r\nsluttish behaviour. Whether as a society, we ought to condemn as\r\npossibly
    risky but certainly unwise, sex between young people that is\r\ndevoid of emotional
    intimacy, trust, responsibility, mutuality and\r\nrespect? If we ought to say
    loudly and clearly to young people (or\r\nperhaps all people) that it is foolhardy
    to engage in one of the most\r\nphysically intimate acts of which humans are capable
    with people we\r\ndonâ\x80\x99t know well, or to whom we are attracted for the
    shallowest of\r\nreasons?\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99m in two minds about this. On the one
    hand, I feel sure there are some\r\nyoung people, as well as older ones, who can
    not only handle the costs\r\nbut truly enjoy the benefits of what Erica Jong famously
    referred to as\r\nthe zipless fuck. Why should people be made to feel bad if all
    they want\r\nat a particular time of their life is casual sex, as long as they
    are\r\nruthlessly honest about this with their partners and make sure a condom\r\nis
    at hand?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I remain skeptical that for most people, most
    of the\r\ntime, sex is ever that easy. There is good evidence that human beings\r\nare
    hard-wired to connect physical and emotional intimacy or, to use\r\ncommon parlance,
    to find that sex brings them closer. Avoiding such\r\nintimacy demands an emotional
    distancing and mental compartmentalization\r\n- a cutting off of body from mind
    and from feeling - that not only\r\nundermines the self but dehumanizes the living,
    breathing, dreaming\r\nperson beside you. As Jong herself put it, â\x80\x9CThe
    zipless fuck isâ\x80¦rarer\r\nthan the unicorn. And I have never had one.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    the bottom line is that while women have the same right as men\r\nto act like
    sluts, this may not always be the right thing for either sex\r\nto do."
