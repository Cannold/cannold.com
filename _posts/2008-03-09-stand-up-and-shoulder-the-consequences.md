    of us are repelled by placard-carrying pro-lifers who yell at women\r\nor impede

    Nisshin Maru to covertly tag it with a\r\ntracking device, sabotaging the shipâ\x80\x99s

    are not medical professionals being compelled to\r\nparticipate in contraceptive
    counselling or abortion, and the crew of\r\nthe Steve Irwin are not mariners whoâ\x80\x99ve
    been forced to whale. The\r\nproblem for both groups is not that they are being
    compelled to do\r\nsomething they donâ\x80\x99t believe in, but that something
    they donâ\x80\x99t believe\r\nin is being allowed to happen at all.\r\n\r\nThere
    is nothing wrong with standing up to be counted when you believe\r\nlaw or policy
    or practice is wrong. There is nothing wrong with saying\r\nso in a way designed
    to highlight the injustice you perceive and - by\r\nchanging public sentiment
    - making things different. You can even break\r\nthe law to achieve these aims.
    In fact, breaking the law is what civil\r\ndisobedience is all about.\r\n\r\nBut
    with rights come duties. Civil disobedience has high rates of\r\ncollateral damage.
    It can obstruct the right of fellow citizens to act\r\non their consciences, and
    stop them from getting on with the lawful\r\nactivities that make up their day.
    So civil dissenters are obliged to do\r\ntwo things. The first is to break the

    come calling. And if the crew of the Sea Shepherd is ultimately\r\nfound to have
    broken one or more maritime laws in defence of the whales,\r\nthey are obliged
    to front up at the required jurisdictional port for\r\ntheir day in court.\r\n\r\nSuch
    conclusions hurt. Particularly for those, like me, who are\r\npassionate about
    womenâ\x80\x99s reproductive freedom and the well-being of\r\nwhales.\r\n\r\nBut
    morally speaking, what is good for the goose must be good for the\r\ngander. Hypocrisy
    is a moral crime in nearly every ethical system\r\nbecause everyone knows this:
