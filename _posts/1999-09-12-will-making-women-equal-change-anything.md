    Donovan, Clinical Social Worker\r\n\r\nNO - Leslie Cannold, Feminist Academic\r\n\r\nDear
    Leslie\r\n\r\nOur aggressive, competitive marketplace is a reflection of menâ\x80\x99s
    power\r\nand control, according to the women who want to break it down. How\r\nserious
    are they when, far from challenging the system, women are\r\nclambering to join
    it in their droves? And what will leading women do\r\nabout opportunity advertising

    mail yesterday: the boys wentto\r\nwar with lasers, power figures,attack cycles,
    mutant marauders and\r\nmuscle-bound soldiers complete with armor and weaponry.
    The girls were\r\nall prams, babies in bassinets, shopping trollies, dolls and
    a fantastic\r\ncombination oven/cook-top/kitchen assembly complete with smiling
    girl\r\ncook.\r\n\r\nGiven the slaughter in East Timor, the brochureâ\x80\x99s
    gender division of\r\nmilitary versus mothering was poorly timed, or was it? The
    marketing\r\ngurus say that opportunity advertising and sex-role stereotyping\r\nactually
    work. Most television advertising and programming confirm it.\r\n\r\nYes, the
    male aggressive marketplace of dog-eat-dog thrives in business\r\nas in politics
    and sport; supported by more women than ever.\r\n\r\nSo, is it menâ\x80\x99s aggression
    that has to change or just men?\r\n\r\nOr should we just keep developing technology
    that does men out of jobs\r\nand gets women into them?\r\n\r\nConfused, Frank\r\n\r\nDear
    Frank\r\n\r\nThereâ\x80\x99s no doubt women are eager to participate in the public
    world of\r\nwork. They need financial independence and want their share of public\r\npower.\r\n\r\nGlobalisation
    creates the insecurity that fuels productivity and demand.\r\nWill I land a job?
    Will I be able to do all I must to keep it and still\r\nfind time to marry and
    have a family? These are the questions that\r\npreoccupy so many young people,
    male and female.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it seems disingenuous for author Susan Faludi
    to call off the\r\ngender wars when men started fighting back. The fuel for change
    is\r\npalpable male distress and younger peopleâ\x80\x99s search for non-gendered\r\nanalysis
    and solutions.\r\n\r\nMale aggression is real, and it is not acceptable. It does
    and should\r\nmatter that women are heavily outnumbered in Australiaâ\x80\x99s
    boardrooms and\r\nparliaments. But acknowledging how the world has come to feel
    so\r\noppressive to all of us is going to require a more sophisticated\r\nunderstanding
    of power and oppression than \\`\\`Women have it bad, so men\r\nas a gender must
    be responsible and have it betterâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nLeslie\r\n\r\nDear
    Leslie\r\n\r\nSo, if \\`\\`the fuel for change is (partly) palpable male distressâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99,\r\ndoes
    that mean there might be gain from menâ\x80\x99s pain? Well, that might\r\nmake
    it all worthwhile after all. And if \\`\\`younger peopleâ\x80\x99s search\r\nfornon-gendered
    analysis and solutionsâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 means understanding how we got\r\ninto
    this mess, and some non-aggressive ways out of it, a lot of us men\r\nmight just
    be in that.\r\n\r\nI especially like the bit about how we all need a more sophisticated\r\nunderstanding
    of power relations than the old \\`\\`Women have it bad, so\r\nmen must have it
    betterâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 argument. That will go down with some guys who\r\narenâ\x80\x99t
    feeling too flush about things. As for the gender wars, I think\r\nsome of us
    men might still be struggling with the realisation that our\r\nold weapons (power,
    influence, money and control) might be emotional\r\nboomerangs. To put that another
    way, how much pain are we willing to\r\nendure to maintain our fragile hold on
    power?\r\n\r\nMy original question still stands, though: \\`\\`When there are
    equal\r\nnumbers in the boardrooms, will women do it differently or will\r\noppression
    and aggression still feel the same?â\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\n\r\nEncouraged, Frank\r\n\r\nDear
    Frank\r\n\r\nThat is a hard question. Joan (Kirner) and Moira (Rayner) think so,
    but\r\nthere really is no hard evidence. So far, it looks as if putting a few\r\nor
    some women into the power hierarchy as it stands doesnâ\x80\x99t change\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nI
    suspect that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely -\r\nno exceptions
    made. Some studies suggest \\`\\`femaleâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 characteristics\r\nlike
    intuition, good listening skills and non-aggression can be found\r\namong all
    oppressed minorities; essential skills for managing those in\r\npower.\r\n\r\nWomenâ\x80\x99s
    long association with raising children may also explain their\r\nnurturing skills.
    But, as men increase their active participation in\r\nfathering their children,
    menâ\x80\x99s skills in these areas will also\r\nincrease.The values inherent
    in raising children - selflessness,\r\nsacrifice, interdependence - stand in stark
    contrast to those of the\r\ncompetitive market.\r\n\r\nThe inculcation of these
    values in both men and women is an important\r\nstep in preparing men and women
    to face the real challenge of the next\r\ncentury: the destruction of individualist
    \\`\\`economically rationalistâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\nvalues, policies and practices.\r\n\r\nHereâ\x80\x99s
    my question: do men do, should men do, fatherhood differently to\r\nthe way women
    do motherhood?\r\n\r\nLeslie\r\n\r\nDear Leslie\r\n\r\nYes, I think so. Men have
    to model different ways of being. Men have to\r\nmodel ways of being whole (emotionally
    and rationally) that many of us\r\nstill have not come to terms with yet - especially
    when it comes to our\r\nsons.\r\n\r\nI have never met Joan, though Moira might
    remember me from WA. But I\r\nhave seen those characteristics of intuition, good
    listening skills and\r\nnon-aggression among Aboriginal men and women in the north-west
    and\r\nCentral Desert regions. Seemed to work for them, sort of â\x80¦ eventually.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    in the light of your reminder about inherent child-raising values,\r\nI guess
    that takes us to the heart of the challenge. On Friday, I heard\r\nSister Anne
    Forbes interviewed on ABCâ\x80\x99s 7.30 Report after her evacuation\r\nfrom Dili.
    She said: \\`\\`I just pray we can learn to rule the world with\r\nour hearts
    instead of our heads.â\x80\x99â\x80\x99 By the time Sunday Age readers see\r\nour
    debate, the people she spent the last days with may well be dead.\r\n\r\nI guess
    our challenge is how to reconnect \\`\\`the heartâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 with the head\r\non
    equal terms. Could men and women join forces, maybe?\r\n\r\nCautiously, Frank\r\n\r\nDear
    Frank\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99m still not sure what different ways of being you would
    like to see\r\nmen model for their sons, although my own two boys leave me in
    no doubt\r\nthat it is to their fathers that boys look for a role model. Are you\r\nsaying
    that women are naturally societyâ\x80\x99s \\`\\`heartsâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99 and
    men its\r\n\\`\\`headsâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99? In Victoria, middle-aged women are less
    supportive of the\r\nPremier, Jeff Kennett, than middle-aged men, but I donâ\x80\x99t
    think\r\nfemaleness accounts for this. Rather, it is that mothers are usually\r\nmore
    involved in their childrenâ\x80\x99s lives than fathers, and so notice and\r\ncare
    more when hospitals and schools deteriorate.\r\n\r\nI agree that society needs
    to cultivate and value virtues associated\r\nwith women such as nurture and compassion.
    But these value arenâ\x80\x99t really\r\nfemale any more than their opposites
    are intrinsically male. We value\r\nwhat we know, and what we know comes from
    our experience. As men and\r\nwomen have more of the same experiences in the paid
    workforce and at\r\nhome, they will come to know and value more of the same things.\r\n\r\nThese
    shared experiences, knowledges and values are the basis of the\r\njoint assault
    force you propose. To achieve it, we must continue to work\r\ntowards a society
    in which women and men work as equals and in equal\r\nproportions outside and
    inside the home. Equality is the basis of the\r\nhuman liberation both men and
    women seek, and from which both men and\r\nwomen will benefit. Ironically, it
    is only when women and men achieve\r\nsocial equality that we will finally know
    whether and what sorts of\r\nnatural differences exist between the sexes.\r\n\r\nAnger
    specialist, Vietnam veteran and former \\`\\`rebelâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 Labor MP
    Frank\r\nDonovan has been around anger and violence most of his life. His book,\r\nDealing
    with Anger: Self-help solutions for men (Finch Publishing), was\r\nreleased last

  of individualist \\`\\`economically rationalistâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\nvalues, policies
  and practices.\r\n\r\nHereâ\x80\x99s my question: do men do, should men do, fatherhood
  differently to\r\nthe way women do motherhood?\r\n\r\nLeslie\r\n\r\nDear Leslie\r\n\r\nYes,
  I think so. Men have to model different ways of being. Men have to\r\nmodel ways
  of being whole (emotionally and rationally) that many of us\r\nstill have not come
  to terms with yet - especially when it comes to our\r\nsons.\r\n\r\nI have never
  met Joan, though Moira might remember me from WA. But I\r\nhave seen those characteristics
  of intuition, good listening skills and\r\nnon-aggression among Aboriginal men and
  women in the north-west and\r\nCentral Desert regions. Seemed to work for them,
  sort of â\x80¦ eventually.\r\n\r\nAnd, in the light of your reminder about inherent
  child-raising values,\r\nI guess that takes us to the heart of the challenge. On
  Friday, I heard\r\nSister Anne Forbes interviewed on ABCâ\x80\x99s 7.30 Report after
  her evacuation\r\nfrom Dili. She said: \\`\\`I just pray we can learn to rule the
  world with\r\nour hearts instead of our heads.â\x80\x99â\x80\x99 By the time Sunday
  Age readers see\r\nour debate, the people she spent the last days with may well
  be dead.\r\n\r\nI guess our challenge is how to reconnect \\`\\`the heartâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99
  with the head\r\non equal terms. Could men and women join forces, maybe?\r\n\r\nCautiously,
  Frank\r\n\r\nDear Frank\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99m still not sure what different ways of
  being you would like to see\r\nmen model for their sons, although my own two boys
  leave me in no doubt\r\nthat it is to their fathers that boys look for a role model.
  Are you\r\nsaying that women are naturally societyâ\x80\x99s \\`\\`heartsâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99
  and men its\r\n\\`\\`headsâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99? In Victoria, middle-aged women are
  less supportive of the\r\nPremier, Jeff Kennett, than middle-aged men, but I donâ\x80\x99t
  think\r\nfemaleness accounts for this. Rather, it is that mothers are usually\r\nmore
  involved in their childrenâ\x80\x99s lives than fathers, and so notice and\r\ncare
  more when hospitals and schools deteriorate.\r\n\r\nI agree that society needs to
  cultivate and value virtues associated\r\nwith women such as nurture and compassion.
  But these value arenâ\x80\x99t really\r\nfemale any more than their opposites are
  intrinsically male. We value\r\nwhat we know, and what we know comes from our experience.
  As men and\r\nwomen have more of the same experiences in the paid workforce and
  at\r\nhome, they will come to know and value more of the same things.\r\n\r\nThese
  shared experiences, knowledges and values are the basis of the\r\njoint assault
  force you propose. To achieve it, we must continue to work\r\ntowards a society
  in which women and men work as equals and in equal\r\nproportions outside and inside
  the home. Equality is the basis of the\r\nhuman liberation both men and women seek,
  and from which both men and\r\nwomen will benefit. Ironically, it is only when women
  and men achieve\r\nsocial equality that we will finally know whether and what sorts
  of\r\nnatural differences exist between the sexes.\r\n\r\nAnger specialist, Vietnam
