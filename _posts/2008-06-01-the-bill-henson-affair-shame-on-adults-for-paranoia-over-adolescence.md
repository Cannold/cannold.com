  content: "For a friend of mine, adolescence was no time of innocence. It was the\r\nworst
    and most confusing time of her life; made all the worse by the\r\ninsistence of
    the adults she knew that the pain would be useful later.\r\n\r\nThe main problem
    was that believed she had lost her fatherâ\x80\x99s love.\r\nAlways such a tactile
    man, one day he simply refused to touch her. No\r\nwrestling on the bed. No more
    hugs. The mere sight of her body seemed to\r\ncause physical pain. He would wince,
    and turn away.\r\n\r\nIn her eighteenth year the rift healed as mysteriously as
    it had opened.\r\nNow they are close. But my friend never forgot her fatherâ\x80\x99s
    sudden and\r\nmysterious rejection. To forgive him, to have trusting relationships\r\nwith
    other men, she had to understand what went wrong.\r\n\r\nThis is what she thinks
    happened. One day she and her dad were horsing\r\naround and he got aroused. Dismayed,
    disturbed and disgusted at such an\r\nunbidden physical response, he went into
    repressive overdrive. Rejecting\r\nthe feelings and the person who caused them
    - her - in one fell swoop.\r\nNo wonder her frantic efforts to discover the nature
    of her\r\ntransgression so she could make amends for it and return things to\r\nnormal
    between them, failed. Matters would only improve when she had\r\nfinished growing
    up.\r\n\r\nThe hysterical over-reaction to Bill Hensonâ\x80\x99s photographs of
    naked\r\nadolescents, prompted by a complaint to police by Braveheartsâ\x80\x99
    Hetty\r\nJohnston, has put me in mind of this story. Johnson has her own demons.\r\nIt
    is easy to see how her failure to recognise that her father-in-law\r\nhad indecentld
    assaulted her daughter might make her hyper-vigilant\r\nabout the seemingly innocent
    motives and behaviour of all men.\r\n\r\nBut we donâ\x80\x99t have to share her
    suspicions. Instead, we could accept the\r\nobvious fact that most men are neither
    pornographers nor paedophiles.\r\nSecure in this knowledge, we could welcome Bill
    Hensonâ\x80\x99s attempt to\r\nprise open the complexity of adolescence, and the
    response of adults to\r\nit. Betwixt and between, neither child nor adult, the
    adolescent body\r\nand place in society is ambiguous, uneasy and paradoxical.
    Beautiful and\r\nawkward, vulnerable yet powerful, Hensonâ\x80\x99s photographs
    invite us to\r\nconsider questions contemporary western societies struggles to
    ask,\r\nlittle less answer. Can the budding bodies and sexuality of adolescents\r\nbe
    celebrated without being exploited? Can we recognise the\r\nvulnerability of adolescents,
    particular girls, without supporting the\r\nvictim mentality that accompanies
    dis-empowering conceptions of female\r\nsexuality? Can we allow adolescents to
    feel proud of their bodies and\r\nsexuality, or will we - by condemning as pornographic
    the photographing\r\nof such bodies - forever insist on shame?\r\n\r\nIf our response
    to those who dare raise such questions is to label them\r\npornographers and paedophiles,
    I donâ\x80\x99t like our chances.\r\n\r\nSo the final words of this column are
    for the young woman featured on\r\nthe invitation to Hensonâ\x80\x99s exhibit.
    The one those orchestrating the\r\ncontinuing witch hunt against the artist claim
    to be so concerned about,\r\nand whose image was among those the Prime Minister
    labelled,\r\nâ\x80\x9Crevolting.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nYou are beautiful, darling. Be
    proud. Years from now, youâ\x80\x99ll still be\r\nadmired while those responsible
    for the current stupidity will be long\r\ngone. Thank you for giving us insight
    into this complex time in your\r\nlife: into who you are and the strong woman
    you are becoming. Find it in\r\nyour heart to forgive adults. It is we, not you,
    who are in the wrong."
