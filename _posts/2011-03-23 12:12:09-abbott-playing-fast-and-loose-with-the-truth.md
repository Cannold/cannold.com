    at times even antagonistic, relationship with facts that donâ\x80\x99t\r\nsupport
    his moral views. This weekâ\x80\x99s performance on Insiders continued\r\nthis
    lamentable tradition. The Minister claimed that non-Government\r\npoliticians
    supported â\x80\x9Chuman cloningâ\x80\x9D, that the Governmentâ\x80\x99s own expert\r\npanel
    recommended the creation of â\x80\x9Chuman animal hybridsâ\x80\x9D, and that a\r\nprivate
    memberâ\x80\x99s bill sponsored by Senator Natasha Stott Despoja would\r\nâ\x80\x9Cforceâ\x80\x9D
    pro-life organisations to â\x80\x9Crefer people to abortion servicesâ\x80\x9D,\r\nand
    deny federal funding to those that didnâ\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Lockhart
    Committee, as well as every reputable scientists\r\nin the country, has supported
    a ban on reproductive cloning: the\r\nimplantation in a womanâ\x80\x99s womb of
    an embryo created in the lab using a\r\ntechnique called Somatic Cell Nuclear
    Transfer. Senator Stott Despojaâ\x80\x99s\r\nbill does not require any pregnancy
    counselling agency to refer a woman\r\nfor an abortion. It simply demands that
    all services advertise in ways\r\nthat make clear to women whether they are pro-life
    or pro-choice.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that while the Health Minister copped criticism
    from\r\nall sides for what Queensland Liberal MP Michael Johnson labeled\r\nâ\x80\x9Cclearly
    inaccurate languageâ\x80\x9D, and what Senator Stott Despoja described\r\nas either
    â\x80\x9Cconfusionâ\x80\x9D or a deliberate attempt by the Minister to mislead\r\nthe
    public, the Prime Minister is unconcerned. â\x80\x9CEverybody can express\r\ntheir
    viewâ\x80\x9D, he told ABC radio. â\x80\x9CTony Abbott should not be restricted
    in\r\nwhat he says just because heâ\x80\x99s the Health Ministerâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nBut
    this response misses the point. Abbott is not being condemned for\r\nwhat he believes,
    or for making his views plain, but for playing fast\r\nand loose with the facts:
    a problem that his status as Federal Minister\r\nfor Health arguably makes worse.\r\n\r\nExaggerating,
    sensationalising, decontextualising, misconstruing,\r\nmischaracterizing and misleading
    are all variations on the dishonesty\r\ncharge. In one case, there is a hair to
    split. In response to concerns\r\nraised predominantly by pro-life groups that
    the demand for human eggs\r\nleft women vulnerable to exploitation, the Lockhart
    committee did\r\nrecommend a lifting of the ban on scientists pursuing the derivation
    of\r\nembryonic stem cells from somatic cell nuclear transfer undertaken on\r\nanimal
    eggs. However, the recommendation clearly stipulates that such\r\nembryos â\x80\x9Cnot
    [be] implanted into the body of a woman or allowed to\r\ndevelop for more than
    14 days.â\x80\x9D Hardly the living and breathing\r\nTransylvanian chimera evoked
    by the Health Ministerâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9Chuman animal\r\nhybridâ\x80\x9D claim.\r\n\r\nBut
    charges of inaccuracy must be upheld for the remainder of the\r\nMinisterâ\x80\x99s
    remarks. In fact, clarifications on the point the Minister\r\nfudged with regard
    to pregnancy counselling were repeatedly offered\r\nduring hearings into the bill
    conducted around the nation last month.\r\n\r\nSome may see such criticism as
    beside the point. Isnâ\x80\x99t the Health\r\nMinisterâ\x80\x99s only crime his
    willingness to be more open and honest than\r\nother politicians about this passions
    and biases? Surely, given the\r\nchance, all politicians attempt to shape law
    and policy to fit their\r\nideals. Why else pursue power?\r\n\r\nThis is true
    to a point. But use and abuse of power are two different\r\nthings. Telling fibs
    to discredit oneâ\x80\x99s opponents and their case for\r\nchange, not to mention
    relying on the prestige of high office to bolster\r\noneâ\x80\x99s falsehoods,
    is just not cricket. Rather, it is a condemnable\r\nmeans-to-an-end strategy that
    disregards the rules for fair play in the\r\nservice of winning at all costs.\r\n\r\nFurther,
    those who operate in this fashion rule themselves out of the\r\nrole of honest
    broker in the event that their preferred approach is not\r\nthe one delivered
    by democratic processes. This has been the case with\r\nAbbott and the drug RU486.
    Having fought so hard, and at times unfairly,\r\nto prevent the removal of his
    ministerial veto over womenâ\x80\x99s access to\r\nthe drug (phrases like â\x80\x9Cbackyard
    miscarriageâ\x80\x9D and â\x80\x9Cpop and forgetâ\x80\x9D pill\r\npeppered his
    contributions to the debate), significant questions hang\r\nover his capacity
    to impartially oversee the post-conscience-vote\r\nprocesses required to bring
    the drug to the market. In May, a\r\npharmaceutical company executive revealed
    that the Minister and his\r\noffice threatened his company with adverse consequences
    if it applied to\r\nregister the drug in Australia.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CThe thing
    I enjoy most as a politician,â\x80\x9D Tony Abbott said recently, â\x80\x9Cis\r\nthe
    opportunity to be taken seriously when you say somethingâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nToo
    right. And with such power comes responsibility. Tony Abottt is no\r\nfool. Heâ\x80\x99s
    more than capable of getting across a brief, if this is what\r\nhe wishes to do.
    Minister Abbottâ\x80\x99s failure to get the facts right when\r\nissues of gender,
    reproduction and sexuality are at stake undermines the\r\nquality of public debate
