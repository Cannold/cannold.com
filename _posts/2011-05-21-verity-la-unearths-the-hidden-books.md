    our secrets. Sometimes theyâ\x80\x99re so difficult to keep, we get rid of the
    evidence. We wonâ\x80\x99t admit to having read them even though we might be glad
    we did. Books that might have been instrumental in helping us better understand
    ourselves, to negotiate certain experiences or to help us make difficult decisionsâ\x80\x94and
    yet weâ\x80\x99d be ashamed to have someone notice them on our bookshelves. Youâ\x80\x99ve
    written books such as these. How does it feel to be the writer of material readers
    prefer to keep hidden?\r\n\r\nLeslie Cannold: Yes, that was true of my first book,
    The Abortion Myth. I hadnâ\x80\x99t realised that was what was going on until
    a young woman came to interview me for a student film. She said my book had changed
    her life and I was her hero. We did the whole interview and afterwards I asked
    her if she would like me to sign her copy and she looked shocked. â\x80\x9CI didnâ\x80\x99t
    buy it,â\x80\x9D she said. â\x80\x9CI got it from the library. I couldnâ\x80\x99t
    have it on my shelves.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think my objective as a writer
    â\x80\x93 and of course this incident made me think about this â\x80\x93 is to
    change peopleâ\x80\x99s lives: to enrich them in some way, make them think about
    things that are important to them or decide what these things are, feel empowered.
    Clearly, The Abortion Myth has achieved this as it continues, so many years later,
    to go in and out of libraries. I wish I didnâ\x80\x99t need to earn money as Iâ\x80\x99m
    far less interested in this, but sadly I do. So perhaps itâ\x80\x99s true to say
    that knowing what I know now, I wouldnâ\x80\x99t write another book like The Abortion
    Myth, despite being glad I was ignorant enough to have written it then.\r\n\r\nAlec
    Patric: Perhaps thatâ\x80\x99s what weâ\x80\x99re trying to gauge when we pick
    up a book and read the blurb. When we weigh the various endorsements most books
    come with from other authors. Or when we simply look to the cover for clues to
    the change itâ\x80\x99s hoping to provoke in us. The Abortion Myth isnâ\x80\x99t
    somewhere we want to dwell and I suppose thatâ\x80\x99s why whatever changes it
    brings into our lives, when weâ\x80\x99re done with it, we want to walk away without
    carrying the book along with us. Thereâ\x80\x99s the opposite end of the spectrum
    where we very much want to bring the book along. I recently had a customer come
    into my bookstore holding your novel to her chest, saying she wanted to buy another
    copy for her friend. So it seems youâ\x80\x99ve written a novel now that will
    create a change that readers will want to share. I was hoping you could talk about
    the process of writing The Book of Rachael. I was also wondering whether youâ\x80\x99d
    agree that the books most potent in changing a readers life are the oneâ\x80\x99s
    that have changed the writerâ\x80\x99s life.\r\n\r\nLeslie Cannold: Iâ\x80\x99m
    not sure if thatâ\x80\x99s true, but thereâ\x80\x99s something appealing about
    it. Certainly the experience of writing The Book of Rachael was totally other
    than those of penning my previous non-fiction works. The former were expressions
    of who I was and what I already understood and was now communicating to an audience.
    With Rachael I was for a long time wandering in the proverbial desert, working
    towards the skills to bring her from my head on to the page, and all the time
    struggling to maintain faith in myself, faith in the project. Keeping that faith
    became the core emotional challenge that some novelists say is offered by every
    project. I couldnâ\x80\x99t depend on praise or accolades or even the occasional
    pat on the back from others because most people werenâ\x80\x99t even aware I was
    writing the thing. To complete Rachael I had to believe in her and myself. I even
    bought a little flat stone with the word faith engraved on it â\x80\x93 very fairy
    granola I know. But whenever whispered doubts and internal recriminations would
    begin- at certain periods during the process several times a day â\x80\x93 Iâ\x80\x99d
    pick up the stone and squeeze it. Sometimes Iâ\x80\x99d even mutter the word,
    â\x80\x9Cfaith,â\x80\x9D under my breath. Iâ\x80\x99ve always been a big believer
    in â\x80\x9Cfake it until you make it,â\x80\x9D but this was the first time I
    tried to put those principles â\x80\x93 of act as you believe right and the right
    feelings will follow â\x80\x93 into action. And it really did work, though like
    most dramatic shifts of the heart, it has proved unstable, and occasionally even
    transient. So, Iâ\x80\x99m hanging on to that rock.\r\n\r\nAlec Patric: The rock
    of faith sounds appropriately biblical. Rachael is the sister of Jesus and wife
    of Judas Iscariot. Calling your novel The Book of Rachael (reminiscent of The
    Book of Job, The Book of Ruth, etc.) suggests you were not only writing an historical
    tale of loyalty and betrayal, feminism and religion, but were intent on contributing
    to the Bible itself. Did you feel there was a certain amount of hubris in doing
    that?\r\n\r\nLeslie Cannold: I must say that this view of the bookâ\x80\x99s title
    never occurred to me! As can be the way with such things, the title was arrived
    at after much discussion with my editor and the publishing house more generally.
    My working title for the book was Jesusâ\x80\x99s Two Sisters, and â\x80\x9CTwo
    Sistersâ\x80\x9D remains the title of file on my computer file where the manuscript
    is stored. Through the course of the sales and editing process â\x80\x9CJoshuaâ\x80\x99s
    Sister,â\x80\x9D â\x80\x9CRachaelâ\x80\x9D and â\x80\x9CJudging Judahâ\x80\x9D
    were thrown around. The decision to settle on The Book of Rachael was about ensuring
    the title alluded to the biblical nature of the story, and that readers understood
    the bookâ\x80\x99s focus to be on the storyâ\x80\x99s women. My editor felt, and
    I agreed, that proffering a title in which menâ\x80\x99s names were central ran
    counter to the feminist impulse behind the book.\r\n\r\nAlec Patric: Iâ\x80\x99ve
    always thought of the Bible as a loose collection of myths and history penned
    by many different authors. You might even think of it as one of the first literary
    anthologiesâ\x80\x94the theme of the first issue being God. Jesus is clearly a
    very different protagonist for the authors Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. So I
    think your contribution to this story is brave, fascinating, and in fact, fitting.\r\n\r\nThe
    Word is all the more precious for a population for the most part illiterate. For
    those that knew their letters, there was perhaps little opportunity to access
    much in the way of reading material so I was wondering if Rachaelâ\x80\x99s illiteracy
    within that social framework is different to a woman being kept illiterate within
    the modern world? For a society in a perpetual state of warfare, keeping those
    that bring new life into the world, raising the communityâ\x80\x99s children in
    as much safety as could be afforded, was perhaps the primary, most important social
    function. Slavery and subjugation was normal within the Roman empire so the question
    of female freedom might also have a different context. Iâ\x80\x99m wondering how
    you negotiated some of these factors in The Book of Rachael.\r\n\r\nLeslie Cannold:
    I was struck the other day by a story on the radio about a little girl in Afghanistan
    who was climbing on to the roof of the school building in which her brother was
    getting an education to listen to the lessons and later, help him with his homework.
    As you know, I have written a similar scene in The Book of Rachael.\r\n\r\nMy
    guess is that this little girl suffers other oppressions too, ones shared by brother.
    These would be related to the feudal ways of allocating social and economic power,
    and perhaps the many failed and brutal attempts by foreign powers to impose its
    will on Afghanistan. That this is the case didnâ\x80\x99t, I suspect, stop her
    from noticing or finding unjust the deprivations imposed solely because of her
    sex. Indeed, misogyny can often be most brutal among the most socially marginal
    men in colonized lands, with some men using their control over â\x80\x9Ctheirâ\x80\x9D
    women as proof of a masculinity they feel undermined by their social, political
    or economic â\x80\x9Chumiliation.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nOne theory is that so many women,
    especially in the Greco-Roman empire, followed Joshua of Nazareth was because
    he offered them something they lacked and desired. Namely â\x80\x93 and much like
    slaves â\x80\x93 some control over their social, political or economic lives.
    If this is true, it suggests the view I took in the novel that the search for
    such control is central to human nature, is correct.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x93> The Book
    of Rachael has just been released by Text Publishing. Go out to your local bookstore
    and do yourself a favour."

  counter to the feminist impulse behind the book.\r\n\r\nAlec Patric: Iâ\x80\x99ve
  always thought of the Bible as a loose collection of myths and history penned by
  many different authors. You might even think of it as one of the first literary
  anthologiesâ\x80\x94the theme of the first issue being God. Jesus is clearly a very
  different protagonist for the authors Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. So I think your
  contribution to this story is brave, fascinating, and in fact, fitting.\r\n\r\nThe
  Word is all the more precious for a population for the most part illiterate. For
  those that knew their letters, there was perhaps little opportunity to access much
  in the way of reading material so I was wondering if Rachaelâ\x80\x99s illiteracy
  within that social framework is different to a woman being kept illiterate within
  the modern world? For a society in a perpetual state of warfare, keeping those that
  bring new life into the world, raising the communityâ\x80\x99s children in as much
  safety as could be afforded, was perhaps the primary, most important social function.
  Slavery and subjugation was normal within the Roman empire so the question of female
  freedom might also have a different context. Iâ\x80\x99m wondering how you negotiated
  some of these factors in The Book of Rachael.\r\n\r\nLeslie Cannold: I was struck
  the other day by a story on the radio about a little girl in Afghanistan who was
  climbing on to the roof of the school building in which her brother was getting
  an education to listen to the lessons and later, help him with his homework. As
  you know, I have written a similar scene in The Book of Rachael.\r\n\r\nMy guess
  is that this little girl suffers other oppressions too, ones shared by brother.
  These would be related to the feudal ways of allocating social and economic power,
  and perhaps the many failed and brutal attempts by foreign powers to impose its
  will on Afghanistan. That this is the case didnâ\x80\x99t, I suspect, stop her from
  noticing or finding unjust the deprivations imposed solely because of her sex. Indeed,
  misogyny can often be most brutal among the most socially marginal men in colonized
  lands, with some men using their control over â\x80\x9Ctheirâ\x80\x9D women as proof
  of a masculinity they feel undermined by their social, political or economic â\x80\x9Chumiliation.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nOne
  theory is that so many women, especially in the Greco-Roman empire, followed Joshua
  of Nazareth was because he offered them something they lacked and desired. Namely
  â\x80\x93 and much like slaves â\x80\x93 some control over their social, political
  or economic lives. If this is true, it suggests the view I took in the novel that
  the search for such control is central to human nature, is correct.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x93>
