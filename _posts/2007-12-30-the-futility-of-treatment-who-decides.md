    the lead-up to\r\nChristmas, even explosive ones about the questionable withdrawal
    of\r\nlife-sustaining treatment from unconscious patients like Paulo Melo.\r\n\r\nBut
    we need to remember twenty-nine year old Paulo, critically injured\r\nin a car
    accident in Kakadu National Park on December 5th. Just under\r\ntwo weeks later,
    his family were in court, resisting the hospitalâ\x80\x99s\r\ndecision to discontinue
    life support. They failed, and on December 19th\r\nPauloâ\x80\x99s treatment was
    withdrawn. He died around 16 hours later.\r\n\r\nDisputes between doctors and
    families about the advisability of\r\ncontinuing treatment in such circumstances
    are rare. Families that\r\nreject medical advice tend to be either deeply religious,
    struggling to\r\ncome to grips emotionally with the tragedy they face, or convinced\r\ntheyâ\x80\x99ve
    witnessed signs of recovery that doctors - having already handed\r\ndown their
    prognosis - refuse to countenance.\r\n\r\nThe Melos, who had a Priest by their
    sonâ\x80\x99s bed in his final hours, who\r\nbegged the hospital to let Paulo
    survive until after Christmas or New\r\nYear and then â\x80\x9Cwe can see,â\x80\x9D
    and who insisted to the end that Paulo was\r\nshowing signs of recovery, could
    fairly be described as all three. There\r\nis little doubt their determination
    to preserve Pauloâ\x80\x99s life exasperated\r\nthe medical team at the Royal
    Darwin Hospital. â\x80\x9CWe have tried in every\r\nway to prepare this family
    for the withdrawal of the mechanical\r\nventilation,â\x80\x9D Dr Diane Stevens
    was quoted at the final hearing as\r\nsaying. â\x80\x9CWe have alreadyâ\x80¦given
    [them] more than a week to understand\r\nthat he is not going to survive this
    terrible accident and injuriesâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nFor Dr Stevens, the medical prognosis
    was clear, and justified the\r\nHospitalâ\x80\x99s decision to withdraw treatment
    from Paulo. â\x80\x9C[The medical\r\nteam] felt strongly that we could not continue
    the mechanical\r\nventilation as it was futile therapy,â\x80\x9D she told the
    court in a sworn\r\nstatement. â\x80\x9CWe feel strongly it is not ethical to
    continue with futile\r\ntherapyâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nJustice Mildren of the Supreme
    Court of the Northern Territory appeared\r\nconvinced, citing the futility of
    further treatment as one of the\r\ngrounds for denying a continuation of the orders
    restraining the\r\nhospital from withdrawing Pauloâ\x80\x99s life support. â\x80\x9CThe
    difficulty here is\r\nthat the only evidence before me suggests that continuing
    with the\r\ncurrent treatment of this patient is futileâ\x80¦There is no evidence
    to the\r\ncontraryâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nEveryone, doctors most of all, know there
    comes a point when patients\r\nare overmastered by their disease and medicine
    is powerless to\r\nintervene. The problem has been defining this point with the
    precision,\r\naccuracy and ethical cogency required to guide clinical behaviour.\r\n\r\nIs
    treatment one with a 1% chance of success â\x80\x9Cfutileâ\x80\x9D, or does one
    with\r\na 10% chance qualify? And how, and by whom, should such vital\r\nprobabilities
    be calculated? Research warns doctors against relying on\r\ntheir experience,
    which is biased towards recollection of cases that\r\nwent wrong, but robust and
    reliable data is often lacking. Even where it\r\nexists, its relevance to particular
    cases is not always clear. And\r\ndoctors can be wrong. In 2000 the courts had
    to twice restrain those at\r\nSydneyâ\x80\x99s Royal Prince Alfred Hospital from
    withdrawing â\x80\x9Cfutileâ\x80\x9D\r\ntreatment from a comatose 37 year old
    man whose sister, keeping vigil at\r\nthe bedside, insisted was improving. The
    man eventually recovered.\r\n\r\nPerhaps most critically, medical futility does
    not provide a values-free\r\ntool by which medicos - and courts - can make objective
    decisions about\r\nwithdrawing treatment. Instead, it but a mechanism by which
    medical\r\nvalues are allowed to trump those held by non-compliant families of\r\ncritically
    ill patients. In a recent edition of the British Medical\r\nJournal, Charles Weijer
    and Carol Elliott explain how clashes between\r\ndoctors and families over withdrawing
    treatment are â\x80\x9Cnot about the\r\nprobability that an intervention will
    work but about the goals that it\r\nwill serveâ\x80\x9D. For some families, human
    life - even unconscious life - is\r\nof greater value than considerations of that
    lifeâ\x80\x99s quality. In this\r\ncontext, the medical ethicists argue, describing
    as â\x80\x9Cfutileâ\x80\x9D treatments\r\nthat preserve what may be permanently
    unconscious life is â\x80\x9Csuspiciously\r\nlike trying to redefine a debate
    about conflicting values into a debate\r\nabout medical probabilities. And as
    doctors are generally the sole\r\narbiters of medical probability this amounts
    to saying to families,\r\n\\`Your values donâ\x80\x99t countâ\x80\x99â\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nLuckily,
    there is a better way.\r\n\r\nSince the late 1990s, a bevy of experts have been
    arguing that our\r\ninability to define futility objectively requires us to focus
    on\r\ndeveloping a fair process for reaching decisions about withdrawing\r\ntreatment.
    The American Medical Association, for instance, advocates\r\nthat every institution
    develop and adhere to such a policy, which should\r\ninclude joint decision-making,
    negotiated resolution of disagreements\r\nand, if when all else fails, opportunities
    for families to transfer care\r\nof their loved one to another doctor. Only when
    no doctor or hospital\r\nwill accept the patient, may treatment be withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe
    aim of such a policy is not to resolve the values conflict at the\r\nheart of
    disagreements about withdrawing treatments, but to ensure the\r\npower to decide
    is distributed fairly between the doctors who deal with\r\nthese situations everyday,
    and shocked and grieving families forced to\r\nconfront it for the first time."
