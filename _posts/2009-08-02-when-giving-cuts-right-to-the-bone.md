    Peter Singer at Monash University in Melbourne, I signed up\r\nto the newly founded
    Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry.\r\n\r\nThe donation of bone marrow is not
    a simple or pain-free procedure, but\r\nI was young and single and surrounded
    by people absorbed with doing the\r\nright thing. At the time I was vegetarian
    and caring for a young man\r\ndying of HIV/AIDS. Offering a gift of life to someone
    with leukaemia or\r\nother fatal blood disorders without so much as a backwards
    glance was\r\nwhat I wanted to be - and thought I was - all about.\r\n\r\nFast
    forward a few years and I had become a mother, teething baby in one\r\narm and
    a toddler under the other. Undone as much by overwork and lack\r\nof sleep as
    by the guilt of the working mother enterprise (these were\r\nthe Howard years,
    remember?), the call came one afternoon. It was from\r\nthe registry. A woman
    in another state in Australia was sick and needed\r\na bone marrow transplant,
    but none of her siblings was a tissue match.\r\nInitial tests of my blood suggested
    I might be able to help.\r\n\r\nBack then - this was before 2001 - there was only
    one way to get bone\r\nmarrow (today, this method has been joined by another,
    which has its own\r\nrisk profile). I would have to go into hospital and have
    a general\r\nanaesthetic so doctors could extract the required cells from my pelvic\r\nbones
    using hollow needles. Afterwards there would be bruises, pain and\r\nstiffness.\r\n\r\nI
    would need pain relief and would have trouble walking (one woman\r\ndescribed
    it like being kicked by a horse). If I was truly unlucky, the\r\nrare risks associated
    with general anaesthesia, transfusion and\r\ninfection or injury at the needle
    site might come into play.\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99ll be perfectly honest. I did not
    want to do it. I absolutely did not\r\nwant to do it. At that point in my life,
    I needed the risks and\r\ncomplications of tissue donation like a hole in the
    head.\r\n\r\nNormally, when a person accepts the costs of a medical procedure
    it is\r\nbecause she sees them as favourably offset by its benefits - to her.
    For\r\nlive tissue donors the equation is different. Donating bone marrow\r\nrequired
    me to assume both the certain complications and unknown risks\r\nof the procedure
    to benefit someone else - a person I did not know.\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, I
    never had to choose. Additional tests revealed I was\r\nnot compatible and so
    the registryâ\x80\x99s search for a donor moved on. Or so\r\nI presumed. For privacy
    and practical reasons, I could never find out\r\nwhat happened to the woman and
    whether a tissue-matched donor was ever\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nSo what if someone from
    the Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry rang\r\nme today?\r\n\r\nThey might
    because, despite the anguish and uncertainty I suffered so\r\nmany years back,
    I ultimately decided not to take my name off the\r\ndatabase.\r\n\r\nThis was
    not just because I knew my kids would likely be older and less\r\ndependent when
    the phone rang again, but because, however inconvenient\r\nand unpleasant it might
    be, giving marrow to a stranger is the right\r\nthing to do.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it
    is the absence of the usual emotional pulls to gift-giving -\r\nlove, friendship,
    social obligation - that make live, anonymous tissue\r\ndonation proof positive
    that altruism exists. And altruism is the\r\nbeating heart of morality.\r\n\r\nSo
    get on the registry. Give the gift of life."
