    the rights\r\nof women in male-dominated religions and cultures.\r\n\r\nIn the
    past weeks, such conflicts have been writ large across the\r\nnational stage.
    In Melbourne, traditionally-garbed, western educated\r\nMuslim women called for
    action in the wake of a report by the Islamic\r\nWomenâ\x80\x99s Welfare Council
    of Victoria showing that some Imams support rape\r\nwithin marriage, domestic
    violence, polygamy and welfare fraud. Women at\r\nthe conference where the report
    was presented expressed hope that making\r\ntheir concerns public would assist
    Muslim women to access the rights\r\nguaranteed to them by Sharia and Australian
    law.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Minister Jenny Macklin had decided to maintain\r\nmandatory
    income management and other controversial aspects of the\r\nNorthern Territory
    intervention, despite some Aboriginal men and a\r\nnumber of white-fellas in NSW
    and NT branches of the ALP labeling it\r\nracist and against Aboriginal culture.\\\r\nHer
    reason? Many Aboriginal women like it. Walpiri woman Bes Nungarrayia\r\nsays that
    in her community, women and young people support income\r\nmanagement because
    it gives them more control of their money and lives.\r\nData from government-registered
    community stores suggests that Walpiri\r\nwomen and children are not alone, with
    more money being spent on fresh\r\nfood and household essentials, and less on
    gambling, alcohol and\r\npornography since the policy began.\r\n\r\nIt would be
    easy to get confused. Easy to think that for minority women,\r\nreligious and
    cultural rights are instruments of oppression, not\r\nliberation. Easy to conclude
    that the protection of minority women and\r\nchildren sometimes requires religious
    and cultural rights to be put\r\naside.\r\n\r\nBut the problem isnâ\x80\x99t rights.
    Itâ\x80\x99s representation.\r\n\r\nThe Australian community is not monolithic,
    but a complex jigsaw of\r\nreligious, ethnic and cultural groups. Years ago we
    realized that the\r\nneeds and aspirations of one group need to be articulated
    by them, not\r\nby members of the majority. It is because we understand that Christians\r\nshouldnâ\x80\x99t
    speak for Muslims, nor whitefellas for black, that we sought\r\nto involve minority
    representatives in decisions that affect them.\r\n\r\nWhere we erred-and continue
    to do so-is in passively accepting whatever\r\nrepresentative such communities
    throw up. The problem is that some\r\nrepresentatives arenâ\x80\x99t representative
    at all, because the process that\r\ndelivered them was undemocratic, non-existent,
    biased or rigged. One\r\nsure sign this is the case is where a community is fifty
    percent women,\r\nyet those who represent them are always male.\r\n\r\nMuslim
    educator Silma Ihram made this point recently when she spoke of\r\nthe difficulty
    Muslim women have getting a â\x80\x9Cplatformâ\x80\x9D within their own\r\ncommunities.
    Journalist Russell Skelton says Aboriginal culture is\r\ndominated by â\x80\x9Cmale
    thinkingâ\x80\x9D and â\x80\x9Cpowerful [male] figures,â\x80\x9D making it\r\npoor
    at ensuring Aboriginal women always sit at the decision-making\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nBut
    if representation is the problem, it is the answer, too.\r\n\r\nIt is true that
    womenâ\x80\x99s rights and religious/cultural rights may\r\nsometimes clash, but
    this is not inevitable. One reason it is happening\r\nso often now may be for
    no other reason than the undemocratic processes\r\nby which some minority communities
    choose representatives, and the\r\ninevitable consequence of this: that the decisions
    these representatives\r\nleave the issues and concerns of significant parts of
    their own\r\ncommunity out.\r\n\r\nFrom now on, we need to do things differently.
    When we ask minority\r\ngroups what their religion and culture dictates, and what
