    of abortion guarantees a good outcome for women, no\r\nmatter what model ultimately
    makes it into law.\r\n\r\nThey are wrong. Legal advice suggests that some models
    for reforming the\r\nlaw could reduce womenâ\x80\x99s freedom to choose, and their
    access to quality\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nIn late March this year, the Victorian Law
    Reform Commission will offer\r\nthe Brumby government a number of models for reforming
    the current law\r\non abortion. A report just handed down in the UK into scientific
    d\r\nevelopments relevant to abortion law has a number of lessons for us as\r\nwe
    embark on a reform agenda.\r\n\r\nThe first can be found in the fact that such
    a report was necessary at\r\nall. It was because UK law uses fetal viability as
    the dividing line\r\nbetween pregnancies women are allowed to terminate without
    too much\r\ninterference and red-tape, and those they must beg and plead - or
    be at\r\ndeathâ\x80\x99s door - to obtain.\r\n\r\nBut the age at which fetuses
    are viable is a moveable feast. Data from\r\ndifferent countries, even different
    medical centres in the same state,\r\nreveal a range of time periods in which
    infants survive pre-term birth,\r\nwithout and without impairment. Using viability
    to define the rules for\r\nlawful abortion means that every time there is a blip
    in this data, or\r\nsomeone develops a new machine that goes ping, pro-life forces
    have\r\nreason to demand the law be reviewed. The mess and fuss surrounding the\r\nBritish
    report offers a timely reminder to Victorian politicians that if\r\nthey donâ\x80\x99t
    want zealous constituents knocking on their law every few\r\nyears demanding the
    issue be revisisted, the foundations of any dividing\r\nline they choose - if
    one must be chosen at all - must have firm\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\nBut the main
    focus of the Committeeâ\x80\x99s report was disclosure, with the\r\nnever-before-targeted
    object of their demands the inquiryâ\x80\x99s own\r\nwitnesses.\r\n\r\nAt Australian
    government hearings - at least those Iâ\x80\x99ve attended - what\r\nis learned
    in the hearing room about the links and affiliations of\r\nâ\x80\x9Cexpertâ\x80\x9D
    witnesses stays in the hearing room. In the final report, only\r\nthe credentials
    that those giving evidence want revealed are disclosed\r\nto the public.\r\n\r\nBut
    the UK Committee, concerned that some of the submissions they had\r\nreceived
    were from doctors opining on evidence in areas outside their\r\nexpertise, demanded
    full disclosure of relevant interests, including\r\nprevious publication of strong
    views on abortion, or membership of\r\norganizations campaigning on the issue.
    Such disclosures, it noted, were\r\nnot only in line with its own recommendations
    on evidence-based policy\r\nmaking but in keeping with â\x80\x9Caccepted practice
    in the scientific\r\ncommunityâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nAll hell broke loose. Some pro-lifers
    did come clean (Australiaâ\x80\x99s own\r\nJohn Fleming, who in Australian debates
    on abortion tends to describe\r\nhimself as Dr Fleming from the Southern Cross
    Bioethics Institute, added\r\nthat he was a Catholic Priest and President of Campion
    College, linked\r\nwith Christendom College, whose mission is to make Christâ\x80\x99s
    teachings\r\nthe law of the land). But others simply refused, claiming to fear
    that\r\nthe truth would see their views discounted.\r\n\r\nTransparency issues
    were central to the Committeeâ\x80\x99s concerns at other\r\npoints, too. The
    Committee stressed the obligation of doctorâ\x80\x99s claiming\r\nto conscientiously
    object to abortion to alert patients to this fact. It\r\nalso argued for a government
    obligation to protect women from being\r\nmisled by pro-life counselling agencies
    either by requiring such\r\nagencies to present women with health information
    approved by the Royal\r\nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, or to make
    clear in their\r\nadvertising that they did not support referral for abortion.
    In\r\nAustralia, a similar outcome could be achieved if Federal Labor\r\nsupported
    the cross-party Pregnancy Counselling (Truth in Advertising)\r\nBill 2006, which
    prohibits pregnancy counselling agencies from engaging\r\nin deceptive and misleading
    advertising.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of concerns about transparency are those about
    autonomy,\r\nthe Greek roots of which mean self-rule. To rule our lives we need
    full\r\nand accurate information on which to base our decisions. Full disclosure\r\nmay
    reveal moral or fiscal conflicts of interest change our decisions\r\nabout how
    much weight to give to the opinions of those claiming to know.\r\nIf we are ignorant
    of any of the elevant facts about those seeking to\r\ninfluence us, the integrity
    of our decisions is undermined and the grip\r\non our lives weakened. Because
    it may have been if we had known the\r\nwhole truth about the person whose words
    swayed us, we might not have\r\ngiven them so much weight - and so chosen differently
    - after all.\r\n\r\nThe Victorian government would be wise to attend to the evidence-based\r\nfindings
    of the Science and Technology Committee with regard to\r\nviability and transparency
    when it reforms our law later this year. And\r\nall governments must follow the
    UK lead and demand both advertisers and\r\nwitnesses are fully frank about who
    they are and where they come from.\r\n\r\nIf they do, stable, evidence-based laws
    and policy that treat women as\r\nfully human shall be our reward."
