  content: "THE tweets were reactions to Chris Brown's appearance at the Grammy Awards.
    All were variations on a theme: domestic violence. \r\n\r\nReading through them
    was an assault, too. A vivid reminder that at the start of the 21st century, there
    are still plenty of insecure women parading about like peahens in ways certain
    to attract abusive partners.\r\n\r\nThey went like this: ''Everyone shut up about
    Chris brown (sic) being a woman beater â\x80¦ Shiiittt, he can beat me up all
    night if he wants,'' and ''Not gonna lie. I'd let Chris Brown beat me #sosexy
    #lovehim #don'tevencare.'' There was ''Chris Brown you can beat me if you want,''
    and ''Chris Brown, please beat me.'' We had ''I don't know why Rihanna complained.
    Chris Brown could beat me anytime he wanted to,'' and ''Damn Chris Brown, you
    can beat me up any time,'' as well as ''Chris Brown can punch me ANY DAY.''\r\n\r\nThere
    were more - 25 in all - but you get the picture.\r\n\r\nWere these women joking?
    I don't think so. Even if they were, it reveals much about what constitutes acceptable
    humour in 21st-century Western societies. As domestic violence expert Dr Dina
    McMillan points out, no one was tweeting jokes about Chris Brown being so hot
    he could beat their child. Perhaps that's because there's no way to make a joke
    about assaulting kids but funnies about battering women? That's another story.\r\n\r\nAre
    such women the only 25 on the planet interested in hooking up with violent men,
    or who think jokes about them are funny? McMillan says no. ''Nothing I read in
    those tweets surprised me.''\r\n\r\nApparently, the world is full of women whose
    self-esteem is so low that being hit by a man is deemed better than not being
    noticed at all.\r\n\r\nMen have long blamed women for rape and domestic violence.
    Who can forget Sheikh Taj Din El-Hilali's 2006 wisdom on the rights and wrongs
    of gang rape: ''If you take out uncovered meat â\x80¦ and the cats come and eat
    it â\x80¦ whose fault is it, the cat's or the uncovered meat?''\r\n\r\nThe elephant
    in the room in these latest tweets is the possibility that after years of feminist
    rejection of just this sort of victim-blaming, men like the Sheikh may be right.
    Maybe some women do ask for it.\r\n\r\nI think not. First, because the ''asking
    for it'' found in the slap-tweets is different to that proffered by male apologists.
    For them - as the Sheikh's comments make clear - \r\n\r\nit is what women wear
    and where they go, or how much they nag, that makes men do it.\r\n\r\nNone of
    the slap-tweets said, ''I'm in a short skirt, rape me.'' Instead, they appear
    to be a public display of what sadly remains a key component of contemporary femininity
    - in some circles at least - a willingness to submit to a powerful man.\r\n\r\nAs
    McMillan reminds us, abuse in real life isn't cute. Tucked away in cyber-space,
    the tweet-slap brigade were at little risk of having their dream-boy's fist shatter
    their jaw. Instead, this group of mostly young women may have been broadcasting
    their adherence to traditional notions of femininity to their own, more accessible,
    dating pool.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was fitting that as the young musical sensation
    Adele swept the awards, inspiring the next generation of women to pursue their
    dreams, the demise of Whitney Houston prompted the next crop of female victims
    to make their intentions known, too.\r\n\r\n"
