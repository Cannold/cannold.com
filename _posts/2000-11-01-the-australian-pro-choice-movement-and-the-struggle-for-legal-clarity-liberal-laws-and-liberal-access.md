    \ \r\n### Full Report Australia, the Johannesburg Initiative, Unpublished November
    2000\r\n  \r\nA condensed version of this report was published in (2001) \"The\r\nAustralian
    Pro-Choice Movement and the Struggle for Legal Clarity,\r\nLiberal Laws and Liberal
    Access: Two case studies in B. Klugman and D.\r\nBudlender (eds) Advocating for
    Abortion Access: Eleven country studies,\r\nThe Johannesburg Initiative, School
    of Public Health, Womenâ\x80\x99s Health\r\nProject, University of Witwaterstrand.
    The Johannesburg Initiative\r\n  \r\nThe Johannesburg Initiative is funded by
    the Government of the\r\nNetherlands and the Swedish Institute Development Cooperation
    Agency\r\n(Sida). The Australian Reproductive Health Alliance (ARHA) and Children\r\nby
    Choice (C by C) funded the research for the Australian Case Study, a\r\nsummary
    of which is published in Advocating for Abortion Access: Eleven\r\nCountry Studies
    (Womenâ\x80\x99s Health Project, School of Public Health,\r\nUniversity of Witerwatersrand,
    2001). The Centre for Applied Philosophy\r\nand Public Ethics has funded the publication
    of the extended Australian\r\nReport.\r\n\r\nThe Johannesburg Initiative is the
    name given by participants to a\r\nthree-phase international project of which
    the full title is â\x80\x9CCapacity\r\nbuilding for advocacy on expanding abortion
    policy and access: sharing\r\nof national experiences between countries from diverse
    regions.â\x80\x9D\r\nEighteen countries participated in the Capacity building
    project, which\r\nwas initiated by South African activists after their achievement
    of\r\nliberal law reform in 1997. The aim was to compare and contrast the\r\npolitical
    and social contexts of countries with diverse abortion laws\r\nand access in order
    to draw generalisable conclusions about the social\r\ncontexts and advocacy strategies
    that inhibit or facilitate change.\r\n  \r\nPhase one took place from December
    1999 to June 2001, concluding with\r\nthe publication of Advocating for Abortion
    Access in which case studies\r\nof abortion advocacy in eleven countries - including
    Australia - were\r\ndescribed and a comparative analysis provided to assist activists
    to\r\nâ\x80\x9Clearn from one anothersâ\x80\x99 experiencesâ\x80\x9D. [Klugman,
    2001 \\#298]\r\n  \r\n### The Purpose and Design of this Report\r\n  \r\nHowever,
    unavoidable limits on the length of the Australian contribution\r\nto Advocating
    for Abortion Access meant that important data and analysis\r\nwas unable to be
    included. It was felt that this work may be of use to\r\npro-choice advocates
    keen to understand and apply the 3 lessons learned\r\nby pro-choice advocates
    involved in the change processes in WA and the\r\nACT in 1998.\r\n  \r\nWe thus
    sought to produce a full report, tiered and organised by\r\ncampaign stages, to
    enable activists to choose the level of detail they\r\nwished to read and to quickly
    access sections relevant to their current\r\nneeds and interests. However, the
    report has also been designed to\r\nfacilitate comparisons between WA and the
    ACT and thus encourage the\r\nbuilding of the â\x80\x9Cmid- levelâ\x80\x9D [Albury,
    1989 \\#22] theory necessary to\r\nadvance local understanding of what works and
    what doesnâ\x80\x99t to achieve\r\nreform abortion law reform and enhanced access
    to services.\r\n  \r\nThe author, ARHA and C by C are extremely grateful to the
    Centre for\r\nApplied Philosophy and Public Ethics (CAPPE) for offering its assistance\r\nin
    publishing the full report. We stress, however, that responsibility\r\nfor its
    contents fall to us alone.\r\n  \r\n### Objectives of the Australian Report\r\n
    \ \r\n-   To examine abortion policy, law and womenâ\x80\x99s access to abortion\r\n
    \   services prior to, during and (insofar as possible) after\r\n    legislative
    change that took place in 1998 â\x80\x931999 in two Australian\r\n    States:
    Western Australian (WA) and the Australian Capital Territory\r\n    (ACT);\r\n-
    \  To identify or to provide the basis for identifying the key factors\r\n    facilitating
    and constraining achievement and/or maintenance of\r\n    liberal and/or clarified
    abortion law and/or policies;\r\n-   To identify or to provide the basis for identifying
    the key factors\r\n    facilitating and constraining achievement and/or maintenance
    of\r\n    liberal access to abortion services in Australia;\r\n-   To make suggestions
    based on this analysis, where possible, for\r\n    future pro-choice advocacy
