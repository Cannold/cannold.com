    Nixon has raised the stakes. In media interviews, and in her book, she has played
    the gender card. In an interview on ABC TV's 7.30, she contended that in the judgments
    made about her by the commission and the media on a number of matters, \"I â\x80¦
    have been harshly done by â\x80¦ and I think perhaps being a high-profile woman
    is part of that, and I guess that's what I've spoken out about at this time''.\r\n\r\n''Speaking

    personal experience can merge with those of other women, and any political causes
    or implications discerned. But in Nixon's case, and other instances like hers,
    is it really helpful?\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced. The truth is that Nixon's suggestion
    that if she were a man things would have been different can't be tested. We can't
    rewind nine years, wave the wand that would turn her into Chris Nixon - identical
    to Christine in all ways except for being male - and run the tape again.\r\nBecause
    the charge of sexism and double standards can't be proved, it leaves Nixon vulnerable
    to the accusation it is nothing more than special pleading and excuse-making from
    a woman unwilling to be held to the same standards of accountability and scrutiny
    applied to men. More worryingly, it could lead some to believe that all complaints
    about sexism are matters of opinion, too.\r\n\r\nNow, before anyone comes after
    me with clubs, I want to be clear that I am not saying that women should not name,
    shame and complain when it comes to gender bias for fear of being doubted or disbelieved.
    What I am saying is that if we want to have public conversations about gender
    discrimination that are helpful to present and future generations of women - something
    Nixon is admirably concerned about - we might be better to stick to naming the
    bias we can prove beyond reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\nMy approach in this matter may
    signal the inevitable changing of the feminist guard. Women such as Nixon faced
    a hell of a fight getting to the top. At times, the resistance must have seemed
    insurmountable. Perhaps to overcome it, an argument developed about the benefits
    of having women on the job, and in traditional male roles.\r\n\r\nThese arguments
    accepted the age-old binaries about men and women, but flipped them on their head
    to favour the female side. Women were better listeners, more ethical and more
    co-operative than men. The implied corollary came next - that's why you should
    hire, promote or vote for them.\r\n\r\nBut such gendered claims can turn on those
    who make them. What happens when getting women into senior positions doesn't make
    politics more ethical, or the corporate world less cut-throat? \r\n\r\nOne response
    would be to conclude that the entire equity enterprise was a time-waster and we
    should return to blokes-as-usual forthwith.\r\nWhen I address audiences about
    gender equity, I talk about a brand of feminism that is dedicated to getting women
    half of what's on offer - not because they deserve it, but because we are roughly
    half the population, and it's only fair.\r\n\r\nI wish Christine Nixon happiness
    and success in the future. I have no doubt she did her best to serve us well.\r\n\r\n"
