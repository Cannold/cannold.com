    I donâ\x80\x99t want to be misunderstood and I donâ\x80\x99t want to offend. But\r\nthe
    truth is that there is something horribly rotten going on in my\r\npersonal world
    and \\_ because the personal is political \\_ this nation.\r\nThe rot comes from
    the way we fund our schools. And it is making me so\r\nangry (or is it so grief-stricken
    and guilty?) that I can hardly breath.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Governmentâ\x80\x99s
    education policy, and that of the Rudd\r\nOpposition, waxes lyrical about parental
    choice. But while most of the\r\nparents I have known since our babies napped
    side by side at creche\r\nummed and ahed between private schools A, B and C \\_
    and the one local\r\npublic school \\_ our finances meant that even though several
    of the\r\nindependent schools are just down the street from our house, my choice\r\nwas
    between the local public school and well, the local public school.\r\nSome choice.\r\n\r\nFor
    every dollar the Federal Government spends on a child in public\r\nschool, $5.63
    is expended on a child in a Catholic or other\r\nnon-government school. Among
    OECD countries, Australia ranks third in\r\nthe amount of public money spent on
    private education. In the last\r\nbudget, federal funding to private schools increased
    by $1.7 billion\r\nover five years, while public got just $300 million over the
    same\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nDespite the stark disparity of such figures, parents of
    public school\r\nkids find it hard to cry foul. Mainly, I think, because of a
    fear that\r\ndoing so makes us look like we believe money is everything, and that\r\nadmitting
    the truth - that depriving public schools of funds makes\r\nprivate schools â\x80\x9Cbetterâ\x80\x9D
    - damages our kidsâ\x80\x99 schools even more. The\r\ntruth is that public school
    teachers and administrators are the moral\r\nheroes of our time, sewing more silk
    purses from the sowâ\x80\x99s ears of tatty\r\nand diminishing resources than
    nearly any other group of professionals.\r\nAnd there should be no underestimating
    the toughness of the job.\r\n\r\nLook, I know that gardens, swimming pools, music
    rehearsal rooms, dining\r\nareas, grassy quadrangles, polished floors, school-wide
    climate control\r\nsystems, postâ\x80\x931957 plumbing, regulation sized ovals
    and the organised\r\nsporting teams that go with them arenâ\x80\x99t the heart
    and soul of a good\r\neducation. I know because my sonâ\x80\x99s secondary school
    doesnâ\x80\x99t have any of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut what about enough specialist teachers
    to ensure adequate interest\r\nand diversity in the curriculum? Enough to craft
    the specialised\r\ncurriculum required by students at the top and bottom end of
    the bell\r\ncurve? Class sizes appropriate to the subject being taught? Can anyone\r\nreally
    suggest these are peripheral to the central function of secondary\r\nschooling?
    Yet, here too, our school struggles.\r\n\r\nThe justice issues here are so acute
    they hurt. In what way do the 70\r\nper cent of children attending public schools
    deserve to miss out on the\r\nresources necessary for them to obtain the fundamentals
    of a good\r\neducation when the remaining 30 per cent get enough for this, and
    so\r\nmuch more? Why do only the wealthiest parents in the community, and the\r\nmost
    religious, deserve a real choice about where they educate their\r\nkids?\r\n\r\nBut
    what I really want to talk about is how it feels to be a parent who,\r\nweek after
    week, and \\_ as I look into the future \\_ year after year\r\nwatches her child
    trek out the door to spend all day in an institution\r\nthat try as it might (and
    it does really try) cannot meet his\r\neducational needs. A parent who struggles
    daily with the worst of all\r\nparental emotions: the feeling that she is letting
    her child \\_ this\r\nbeautiful, intelligent, eminently worthy creature whom she
    loves more\r\nthan life itself \\_ down.\r\n\r\nBecause while not a bad school,
    I always knew it was not the best school\r\nfor him. Not best for him because
    he loves art, but several of the art\r\nteachers are known terrors. Not for him
    because heâ\x80\x99s passionate about\r\nsport but there are no pitches or pools,
    coaches or competitions. Not\r\nfor him because he is a talented student and \\_
    while there are signs of\r\nchange \\_ ideological resistance persists to catering
    for kids who need\r\nextension rather than remediation.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CI want
    to go to Private School A,â\x80\x9D he said a few months ago, after\r\nhearing
    his closest friend rave about his school camp, curriculum\r\noptions and sporting
    tutelage. \\`\\`We canâ\x80\x99t afford it,\" I replied. He\r\nwonâ\x80\x99t ask
    again. He can see how frustrated I am at my inability to give\r\nhim the wonderful
    educational opportunities we both see dispensed like\r\nlollies all round us;
    how sad and guilty I feel that despite the fact\r\nthat we are doing the best
    we can, our best isnâ\x80\x99t good enough. He knows\r\nI need to stop thinking
    about, so I can breathe.\r\n\r\nIt doesnâ\x80\x99t have to be like this. True,
    the gleeful dismantling of the\r\npublic education system by the Howard Government
    seems more than OK by\r\nRuddâ\x80\x99s ALP, which recently pledged to preserve
    the inequitable funding\r\nformulas that has caused this unjust mess. â\x80\x9CNo
