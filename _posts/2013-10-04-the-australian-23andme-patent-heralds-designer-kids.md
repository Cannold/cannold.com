  content: "by John Ross \r\n\r\nï¿¼ETHICISTS have raised the alarm after the US Patent
    Office granted rights to a computer-matching technology which could help people
    custom-design babies through IVF.\r\n\r\nCalifornia-based genetic testing company
    23andMe says the system is a â\x80\x9Cfun wayâ\x80\x9D for couples to predict
    the likely characteristics of their children â\x80\x93 both medical traits such
    as lactose tolerance and aesthetic aspects like eye colour.\r\n\r\nBut the technology
    could also allow prospective parents to screen sperm or egg donors for particular
    genetic dispositions. European bioethicists and lawyers say it could lead to people
    specifying height, eye colour, muscle development and personality traits in their
    â\x80\x9Cshopping listâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nEthicists are worried about a technology
    with the potential to help would-be parents select 'designer' babies. \r\n\r\nï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼â\x80\x9CSelecting
    children in (such) ways is hugely ethically controversial,â\x80\x9D they write
    in the journal Genetics in Medicine (http://www.nature.com/gim/) .\r\n\r\nThey
    say the authorities should have considered the ethical implications before approving
    the patent. â\x80\x9CPublic trust is central to the continuing success of human
    genetics research.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThe company says it was considering â\x80\x9Cpotential
    applications for fertility clinicsâ\x80\x9D when it filled the patent application
    in 2009. â\x80\x9CBut much has evolved ... (we) never pursued (those) concepts,
    nor do we have any plans to do so,â\x80\x9D its blog says.\r\n\r\nJayne Lucke,
    from the University of Queenslandâ\x80\x99s Centre for Clinical Research, said
    the company would not be allowed to pursue this line even if it wanted to. Most
    countries only permit selection of embryos, ova or sperm for disease prevention
    purposes.\r\n\r\nIn any case, parents could never be assured of having certain
    types of babies. â\x80\x9CItâ\x80\x99s an illusion that you can design a baby
    that way â\x80\x93 the technology is a fair way away,â\x80\x9D Dr Lucke said.\r\n\r\nUniversity
    of Melbourne medical law expert Loane Skene said it was not the role of patent
    authorities to canvass community views on ethical issues. â\x80\x9CThey do not
    have the resources or expertise,â\x80\x9D she said.\r\n\r\nï¿¼Ethicist and commentator
    Leslie Cannold agreed that patent law was not designed to manage moral complexities.
    â\x80\x9CIt is up to society to get our collective heads around what is happening
    in the lab, and to deploy the political process to regulate it accordingly,â\x80\x9D
    she said.\r\n\r\nBut Dr Cannold said genetic science â\x80\x9Cwas never intended
    for such frivolous useâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nDr Lucke said that while there was general
    acceptance that people should not be able to engineer embryos for other than medical
    reasons, the principal could become â\x80\x9Cmurkyâ\x80\x9D in practice.\r\n\r\nExamples
    included selecting skin tone to reduce the risk of melanoma, or pre-determining
    the babyâ\x80\x99s sex to rule out gender-specific diseases such as haemophilia."
