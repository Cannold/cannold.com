    in Sydney, a group of good-hearted, specially trained lawyers\r\nmet to discuss
    the ways a marriage in this country could be dissolved\r\nusing a process called
    collaborative family law.\r\n\r\nFounded in the USA twenty years ago, collaborative
    family law involves\r\nseparating couples and their lawyers sitting around a table
    and openly\r\nand honestly discussing the range of matters of importance to them,\r\nincluding
    the well-being of their children. The goal is to agree a fair\r\nsettlement that
    best addresses their individual needs, interests and\r\ngoals.\r\n\r\nNegotiations
    are conducted courteously and in good faith, with both\r\nparties bound to disclose
    all pertinent information and material fact,\r\nand not to take advantage of â\x80\x9Cmistakesâ\x80\x9D
    by the other side. Should the\r\ncouple go to court, both collaborative lawyers
    are effectively sacked,\r\nbecause before collaboration starts they sign an agreement
    disqualifying\r\nthem from litigating if it fails.\r\n\r\nBut what really makes

    that are hired by both parties, and\r\ndonâ\x80\x99t take sides.\r\n\r\nForemost
    among these is the child consultant, who meets with each of the\r\ncoupleâ\x80\x99s
    children in order to bring their experience and needs to the\r\nnegotiating table.
    The goal is for both spouses to comprehend their\r\nchildrenâ\x80\x99s experience
    of conflict and their post-divorce requirements in\r\na deep and transformative
    way. The resulting wake-up call can lead\r\nparents to change their attitude to
    their former partner and they way\r\nthey act around their kids, and to negotiate
    parenting arrangements that\r\nsupport each childâ\x80\x99s developmental needs.\r\n\r\nI
    am the child of divorce. My parents separated in the early 1970s when\r\nI was
    seven. There was alimony and visitation, a reconciliation followed\r\nby divorce,
    and a custody battle that only ended when my mother agreed\r\nto let my brother
    move in with my Dad. They rowed in person and over the\r\nphone until I left home
    for University at age eighteen.\r\n\r\nAround 12 per cent of children in intact
    families experience mental\r\nhealth problems in childhood. This figure rises
    to 25 per cent for\r\nchildren of divorce. Children need their parents to tune
    into their\r\nneeds when divorce happens, and to be emotionally available to them.\r\nConflict,
    which turns to acrimony as the years progress, gets in the way\r\nof that happening,
    This is why the children of conflicted and litigated\r\ndivorces have the worst
    mental health outcomes of all.\r\n\r\nA 2006 Australian study found that one third
    of children whose parents\r\nreported high levels of conflict had psychological
    disturbance at\r\nclinical levels. Other studies show they are more likely to
    leave school\r\nearly and more likely to divorce as adults. â\x80\x9CConflict
    in divorce impacts\r\nchildren in terrible ways,â\x80\x9D says Professor Jennifer
    McIntosh. â\x80\x9CChildren\r\ncanâ\x80\x99t afford settlement processes that
    exacerbate conflict between\r\nparents.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nA child-focused intervention
    in a collaborative divorce process may\r\nreduce the conflict between parents
    and, consequently, improve the\r\nquality of childrenâ\x80\x99s relationships
    with both parents, and their mental\r\nhealth outcomes\r\n\r\nSitting in a hotel
    conference room, listening to the potential of the\r\ncollaborative process to
    produce better outcomes for parents and\r\nchildren, I felt a lump well in my
    throat. How different things might\r\nhave been for my brother and I-how much
