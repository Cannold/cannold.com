  content: "Last week questions were raised about whether Quentin Bryce should\r\nexcuse
    herself from the Governor-Generalâ\x80\x99s role in the event of a hung\r\nparliament
    because of a conflict of interest. Bryceâ\x80\x99s son-in-law, Bill\r\nShorten,
    is a Labor MP likely to have a senior role in the Gillard\r\ngovernment if it
    retains power.\r\n\r\nIn response to the outcry, the Governor-General has sought
    legal advice\r\non â\x80\x9Cconcerns raised about her personal position in the
    current political\r\ncircumstancesâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nInstances of conflict of interest
    are recurring ethical and legal issues\r\nin societies governed by the rule of
    law. This can be seen in ancient\r\nmaxims that warn a man not to â\x80\x9Cserve
    two mastersâ\x80\x9D or be a â\x80\x9Cjudge in his\r\nown cause.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nConflicts
    are inevitable. Public officers have family, friends and\r\ncolleagues to whom
    they owe loyalty. Sometimes their duties can\r\nconflict, like where their role
    positions them to make decisions that\r\ncould materially benefit those to whom
    they are personally tied.\r\n\r\nWhere this occurs, public officers must recognise
    it and act swiftly to\r\naddress the problem. Failure to do so can undermine trust
    in the\r\nintegrity of the decision, the office and the institutions of democratic\r\nsociety
    generally.\r\n\r\nWhat all this boils down to is a distinct set of propositions.
    First,\r\nthat having a conflict of interest isnâ\x80\x99t what makes you wrong,
    itâ\x80\x99s the\r\nfailure to address an actual or perceived one thatâ\x80\x99s
    the problem.\r\nSecond, identification of a potential conflict does not and must
    not be\r\nunderstood to impugn the office-holderâ\x80\x99s personal integrity.\r\n\r\nThis
    second point, so misunderstood in the debate so far, is worth\r\nemphasising.
    No one concerned about conflict is saying Bryce lacks\r\nintegrity. Rather, they
    want consideration of a more abstract question,\r\nwhich is this: is it in the
    best interest of Australia that someone in\r\nthe Governor-Generalâ\x80\x99s role,
    and with her family ties, excuse herself\r\nfrom making decisions about the formation
    of Australiaâ\x80\x99s next government\r\nin order to avoid bias or the perception
    of bias?\r\n\r\nThe general, rather than personal, nature of this question explains
    why\r\na person with conflicts cannot effectively redress them by swearing to\r\nact
    in an impartial way. Behaviour need not actually be biased for\r\npublic trust
    to be damaged, a perception of bias is enough. This is why\r\npublic officers
    are morally obliged to absent themselves from decision\r\nwhere there is a conflict
    or others could see it that way.\r\n\r\nThose who raised concerns at the Governor-Generalâ\x80\x99s
    family ties were\r\ndriven by concerns about good governance. They have been disheartened
    by\r\nthe seizure of the issue by those with republican and partisan agendas.\r\nSuch
    rough handling of a matter of principle also insults the public,\r\nwhich has
    made clear at this past election that they yearn to be treated\r\nlike intelligent
    citizens capable of principled debate.\r\n\r\nThe advice handed to the Governor-General
    on Friday suggested that while\r\nthe legal situation was clear, the moral one
    was open. The\r\nSolicitor-General said that while Bryce was under no legal obligation
    to\r\ndisqualify herself, her personal relationships â\x80\x9Cfall to be managed
    as a\r\nmatter of prudenceâ\x80\x9D. Prudence is a moral virtue meaning wisdom
    or good\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nWhether it would be wise for Bryce to make critical
    calls about power,\r\nor whether it would be prudent to delegate this power to
    someone else,\r\nremains a judgment she must make."
