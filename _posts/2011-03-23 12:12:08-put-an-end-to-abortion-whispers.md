  content: "As Prime Minister John Howard put it: â\x80\x9CYou canâ\x80\x99t have
    a situation where\r\nevery time somebody dares to express a view, theyâ\x80\x99re
    jumped upon from a\r\ngreat height and itâ\x80\x99s said the issue is back on
    the agenda.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nHeâ\x80\x99s right. The country needs to take a few
    deep breaths, and a long\r\nview on abortion politics.\r\n\r\nWe all know there
    is a strident coterie of conservative, misogynist men\r\nin the inner circle of
    Government who are not only completely opposed to\r\nwomen having a right to choose
    abortion at any stage of pregnancy, but\r\ndetermined to do something about it.\r\n\r\nWhat
    this means is that over the next few years we are going to be\r\nhearing a lot
    from this powerful posse about female irresponsibility\r\nwhen it comes to contraception.
    Weâ\x80\x99ll be getting an earful about callous\r\nfeminist career-women who
    selfishly choose abortion instead of\r\nmotherhood, or depressed and regretful
    â\x80\x9Cpost-abortiveâ\x80\x9D women who\r\ndemonstrate the folly of society
    trusting the female of the species to\r\nmake important decisions about their
    own futures, and theyâ\x80\x99ll be heaps\r\nabout the number of abortions that
    Australian women have. Theyâ\x80\x99ll be\r\nmore assertions than you can shake
    a stick at about the tragedy of\r\nâ\x80\x9Clate-termâ\x80\x9D abortions (a term
    that will never be defined but will be\r\napplied to all terminations done after
    12 or 14 weeks) and our ears will\r\nbe bashed with graphic descriptions of termination
    techniques used after\r\nthe first trimester.\r\n\r\nIt will be implied that abortion
    causes breast cancer despite the US\r\nNational Cancer Institute stating unequivocally
    in 2003 (based on a meta\r\nanalysis of all existing population-based, clinical
    and animal studies)\r\nthat â\x80\x9Chaving an abortion or miscarriage does not
    increase a womanâ\x80\x99s\r\nsubsequent risk of developing breast cancerâ\x80\x9D.
    It will be asserted that\r\nabortion causes post-traumatic stress, despite Ronald
    Reganâ\x80\x99s Surgeon\r\nGeneral, the anti-choice C. Everett Koop, concluding
    that psychological\r\nproblems from abortion were â\x80\x9Cminuscule from a public
    health\r\nperspectiveâ\x80\x9D, and a panel of the American Psychological Foundation\r\nconcluding
    in 1989 that terminating an unwanted pregnancy posed no\r\nhazard to womenâ\x80\x99s
    mental health.\r\n\r\nQuestions will be raised about the safety of Mifepristone
    (RU 486), a\r\ndrug unavailable in Australia as a result of past anti-choice activism\r\ndespite
    it being used safely for many years by millions of women in at\r\nleast 19 countries.
    Assertions will be made about the unfairness of\r\nmaking anti-choice taxpayers
    subsidize womenâ\x80\x99s abortions through\r\nMedicare (though the entitlement
    of bike-riders to withdraw their taxes\r\nfrom the building of roads, will not
    be mentioned).\r\n\r\nMy point is twofold. First, weâ\x80\x99ve got a long, long
    way to go until the\r\nnext federal election. From this point until at least then
    - and maybe\r\nlonger, given current predictions about time needed for Labour
    to become\r\ncompetitive again - we can feel confident that anti-choice Coalition\r\nforces
    are going to use their power and influence in any way they can to\r\nstir the
    pot on the abortion issue.\r\n\r\nAre we going to jump every time any one of them
    says, â\x80\x9Cbooâ\x80\x9D? Dance like\r\nmarionettes whenever they tug (the
    same old) string? How many times can\r\nand should we â\x80\x9Cdebateâ\x80\x9D
    the same issues, particularly when - despite all\r\nthe argy-bargy at the tail
    end of last year - a national public opinion\r\nsurvey done by the ANU showed
    81% of Australians agreeing that women\r\nshould have a right to choose?\r\n\r\nWhich
    brings me to my second point. Putting a question on notice (as\r\nBoswell has
    done) is not â\x80\x9Creigniting the debate.â\x80\x9D Politicians repeating\r\ntheir
    well-known personal views on the issue (as Beazley has done) is\r\nnot â\x80\x9Cre-igniting
    the debateâ\x80\x9D. In fact, these contributions - such as\r\nthey are - are
    barely newsworthy. If I may quote dictionary.com, a\r\ndebate is a â\x80\x9Cdiscussion
    involving opposing pointsâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nBut what is the â\x80\x9Cpointâ\x80\x9D
    of Boswell asking for precise numbers of\r\nterminations, given heâ\x80\x99s among
    the crowd that thinks even one is too\r\nmany. Isnâ\x80\x99t it a foregone conclusion
    heâ\x80\x99ll conclude, no matter what\r\nfigure he gets, that itâ\x80\x99s too
    high? Thanks to the prolonged discussion\r\nlast year on the topic, we know what
    anti-choice MPs think about\r\nabortion: they donâ\x80\x99t like them, or approve
    of the women who have them.\r\nWhat we donâ\x80\x99t know is what the legislative
    intent is of the MPs who keep\r\ndoing whatever it takes to return abortion to
    the news. As co-conveners\r\nof Emilyâ\x80\x99s List Joan Kirner and Claire Moore
    put it yesterday, a public\r\ndebate on this issue run by politicians without
    any declared legislative\r\nchange is â\x80\x9Cat best unnecessary and at worst
    misleading.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nWhat are anti-choice MPs plotting to do to womenâ\x80\x99s
    freedom to get an\r\nabortion? How are their secret plans going to affect the
    freedom of\r\nAustralian women and couples to decide for themselves if and when\r\ntheyâ\x80\x99ll
    have children?\r\n\r\nSuch revelations would not only be newsworthy, they would
    provide the\r\ninformation for a real debate, and a fair political battle, to
    begin.\r\nOnce the doors of all those prayer sessions and secret meetings are\r\nflung
    open, Australian women and families will finally know - instead of\r\nhaving to
    guess - precisely how their reproductive freedoms are going to\r\ncome under attack
    in the next few years. Experts will be able to\r\nevaluate and make comment on
    how women and couples, from city and bush\r\nand those of greater and lesser means,
    would be affected by mooted\r\nadministrative changes and legislative proposals.
    The media could ask\r\npoliticians to state their voting intentions, and Australian
    women and\r\ncouples would finally know how they, and those they love, are likely
    to\r\nbe affected by the changes proposed.\r\n\r\nSo letâ\x80\x99s stop the pseudo-debate,
    and let the real one begin."
