    Labor governmentâ\x80\x99s education agenda is neither broad nor deep, nor a\r\nreform
    agenda by any definition of that word. Instead, Laborâ\x80\x99s education\r\npolicy

    in the lead-up to the last Federal election, Labor\r\npromised parents who aspire
    to send their kids to private school, or\r\nactually do, a perpetuation of the
    unfair funding formula introduced by\r\nJohn Howard.\r\n\r\nAccording to Associate
    Professor Jim McMorrow, this formula helps fund\r\nevery independent school student
    in the country to the tune of $13.500.\r\nThis is one and one half the amount
    dedicated to educating kids in the\r\npublic system. It is a formula that since
    1996 has seen a 37% increase\r\nin resources for kids who attend Catholic schools,
    a 29% increase for\r\nthose at independent schools, but a mere 24% boost for the
    majority of\r\nkids, who attend public school. The funding flows from tax-payers
    to\r\nprivate school coffers with few strings or transparency measures\r\nattached
    and will do - according to the Education Minister - until at\r\nleast 2012.\r\n\r\nGillardâ\x80\x99s
    claim that complaints about such rampant inequity are a\r\ndiversion from the
    main game of goose-stepping to the Governmentâ\x80\x99s\r\nagenda is not just
    wrong, itâ\x80\x99s offensive. Equity in school funding is no\r\ndiversion, itâ\x80\x99s
    the main moral game. What kind of parents and educators\r\nwould accept such a
    Marie Antoinette style of funding? What kind of\r\nhuman beings would say, â\x80\x9CThanks
    Julia. For our kids, crumbs from the\r\ntable are OK.â\x80\x9D?\r\n\r\nBut while
    the governmentâ\x80\x99s rhetoric and diversionary tactics are\r\ncontemptible,
    its motive are clear. John Howardâ\x80\x99s funding formula was\r\ndesigned to
    create more parents who send their kids to private school\r\nbut can only just
    barely afford to do so. Some such parents may\r\nbelieve-wrongly as it turns out-that
    a steadily increasing flow of\r\ntaxpayer dollars to private school coffers keeps
    fees lower than they\r\notherwise would be. With just over half of NSW private
    school parents\r\ntelling researchers that they already make large or considerable\r\nsacrifices
    to pay fees now, itâ\x80\x99s little wonder the claws come out when\r\nanyone
    questions the status quo.\r\n\r\nHowardâ\x80\x99s aim was to fund schools in a
    way that would provoke\r\nmiddle-class flight from the public system and wedge
    the\r\nthen-Opposition. He succeeded on both counts. There are no longer enough\r\nvoters
    engaged with the public system or supportive of the values it\r\nrepresents to
    make an equitable funding regime a politically profitable\r\npolicy for Labor.
    Thus has the foundation stone of any egalitarian and\r\nsocially mobile society-a
    compulsory, first-rate, free and secular\r\neducation for all-been transformed
    into a political problem for ALP\r\npoliticians, who strive to keep the issue
    off the agenda and pillory\r\nthose who debate it on any terms but their own.\r\n\r\nThis
    must not be a cause for despair, but hard-eyed realism. To\r\nparaphrase Forrest
    Gump, public education allies are as public education\r\nallies do. Politicians
    and parties that stand up for the values of\r\nequity and inclusion and fight
    for the resources required to give all\r\nAussie kids a quality education deserve
    our praise. Those that donâ\x80\x99t\r\nmust hear us roar, and believe us when
