    the conclusion\r\nof a speech I gave recently. We were at a function that my\r\norganization-which
    had done a lot of heavy lifting to achieve a shared\r\ngoal-had arranged to thank
    other individuals and groups who contributed\r\nto a successful outcome.\r\n\r\nEarlier
    that week, I had made a similarly approving comment about a\r\npolitician I had
    watched closely during a law reform debate. In his role\r\nas speaker, he oversaw
    the debate about a measure to which he was\r\nopposed. However, when it became
    clear that his side had lost, and the\r\nbill would become law, he made an extraordinarily
    gesture. He appointed\r\nthe two main supporters of the bill to count the final
    vote so they\r\ncould make history by signing the paper that verified the tally.\r\n\r\nGraciousness
    is a funny old ideal. Like an elevator jammed between\r\nfloors, it seems caught
    somewhere between etiquette and etiquette. The\r\ndictionary says the gracious
    are marked by kindness, courtesy, tact,\r\ndelicacy, charm and good taste. Emily
    Postâ\x80\x99s Etiquette defines\r\ngraciousness as the ability to handle situations
    with aplomb,\r\nflexibility and thoughtfulness towards others. Ethics has little
    to say\r\nabout graciousness. None of the references on my shelf mention it at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nI
    think they should. The guard of honour that players and officials from\r\nboth
    St Kilda and Hawthorn formed to mark the retirement of St Kilda\r\nfootballer
    Robert Harvey seems more than an act of good manners. To say\r\nof John Howardâ\x80\x99s
    concession speech on election night 2007 then it was\r\nâ\x80\x9Ccourteous,â\x80\x9D
    gives inadequate recognition to the moral fortitude\r\nrequired-in the face of
    what almost certainly was a whirlwind of\r\nnegative emotions-to have delivered
    it.\r\n\r\nGraciousness can express generosity of spirit, and it this that gives\r\nthe
    quality its moral character. Philosopher Joseph Kupfer reminds us\r\nthat there
    are more ways to give then can be measured by money.\r\nGraciousness is a reflection
    of emotional generosity, a giving to others\r\nof more than the rules specify
    they are owed. The speaker of the house\r\nwas obligated to ensure that the debate
    and vote were conducted fairly:\r\nno more or less. That he offered more to his
    political opponents is a\r\nlot of what graciousness is about.\r\n\r\nBut it is
    not the whole story. Think of how we use the word: gracious in\r\ndefeat; grace
    under pressure. What makes an act gracious is not only its\r\nabove-and-beyond
    quality, but its delivery at a time of high emotion. At\r\na time when behaving
    badly could be forgiven, and doing only what is\r\nrequired seems plenty to ask.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    graciousness is a mark of respect: an acknowledgment of the\r\nfair way oneâ\x80\x99s
    adversaries played the game, and for the rules and\r\ninstitutions that governed
    the conflict. Think back to the concession\r\nspeech Al Gore made when the US
    Supreme Court ruled-incorrectly as it\r\nturned out-that he had lost the 2000
    election for president. â\x80\x9CLet there\r\nbe no doubt,â\x80\x9D he said, that
    â\x80\x9Cwhile I strongly disagree with the courtâ\x80\x99s\r\ndecision, I accept
    itâ\x80¦and for the sake of our unity as a people and the\r\nstrength of our democracy,
    I offer my concession.â\x80\x9D Goreâ\x80\x99s graciousness\r\nwas designed to
    calm the emotions of his supporters and to encourage\r\nthem to respect the result,
    even if they disagreed with it.\r\n\r\nIn this way does the gracious act impel
    us to remember matters much\r\nlarger than ourselves and the partisan preferences
    and emotions that may\r\nrule our heart at any one time."
