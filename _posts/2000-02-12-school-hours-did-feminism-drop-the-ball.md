  content: "Working parents may not be able to rely on the womenâ\x80\x99s movement
    to help\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nJOHN HOWARD is no feminist. So perhaps itâ\x80\x99s no
    surprise that his\r\nrecently stated desire to promote a better balance between
    work and\r\nfamily by extending school hours went down like a lead balloon with\r\nfeminists.\r\n\r\nWhile
    the reasons for this are complex, several important ones suggest\r\nthat the womenâ\x80\x99s
    movement may no longer be the best organisation to\r\narticulate the plight of
    working parents, and to fight for a\r\nre-balancing of their employment and family
    responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties that school hours and school holidays
    pose for working\r\nparents are legion. While schools are only one institution
    posing\r\nproblems for working parents, and institutions only one source of the\r\nimbalance
    equation, Howardâ\x80\x99s comments provided an opening to press for a\r\nround-table
    discussion on the issue. Such a summit should include\r\nhigh-level representatives
    of parents, teachers, young people, business\r\nand government.\r\n\r\nPolls in
    America, Britain and Australia show that women nominate the\r\nlack of balance
    between their work and family responsibilities as their\r\nmost pressing problem.
    Yet emerging data suggests that men increasingly\r\nexpect to play an active role
    in raising their children, despite\r\nspending an average of four hours more a
    week at the office than women.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Australian Bureau of Statistics
    figures last week showed that\r\nabout a third of managers, professionals and
    associate professionals -\r\nmost of whom are male, parents and aged between 35
    and 60 - want to work\r\nfewer hours.\r\n\r\nSo why did the womenâ\x80\x99s movement
    drop the ball on Howardâ\x80\x99s\r\nneed-for-better-balance comments? One important
    reason was the desire\r\nnot to antagonise teachers (most of whom are women) and
    the teachers\r\nunion, which is a traditional ally. The union came out early against
    the\r\nplan because of understandable fears that its implementation would be\r\ninadequately
    funded, and so come at the cost of already overburdened\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\nBut
    good mummy/bad mummy politics may also have played a part in the\r\nspeedy rejection
    of Howardâ\x80\x99s plan. Letters from concerned parents and\r\nchildren flooded
    newspapers, defending the well-earned right of children\r\nto go home at 3.30
    to frolic in the creek, pick daisies in the park and\r\notherwise rejuvenate.\r\n\r\nThe
    Opposition Leader, Kim Beazley, joined in the condemnation of\r\nuncaring parents
    who might support the plan when he rejected it on the\r\ngrounds that he would
    \\`\\`not want (his) child (riding home) on the\r\nroadsâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 at
    5pm.\r\n\r\nThe sub-textual condemnation of working parents in general and working\r\nmothers
    in particular is not hard to discern, although several letters\r\nspelt it out
    anyway: children should not suffer longer hours at school\r\nfor the convenience
    of their career-driven mothers. Such charges of\r\nselfishness were not only levelled
    at any woman who would dare speak up\r\nin support of the extended school hours
    plan, but tarred all those whose\r\nchildren are enrolled in out-of-school-hours
    programs.\r\n\r\nGood mummy/bad mummy politics are a landmine for the womenâ\x80\x99s
    movement.\r\nMany women marching under the anti-feminist or the\r\nIâ\x80\x99m-not-a-feminist-but
    banners believe, rightly or wrongly, that the\r\nfeminist movement supports only
    working women, and devalues the role of\r\nthose who choose to defer or play down
    workforce participation to care\r\nfor their children.\r\n\r\nThe womenâ\x80\x99s
    movementâ\x80\x99s support for Howardâ\x80\x99s proposal would only further\r\nentrench
    these womenâ\x80\x99s beliefs that feminists see little value in their\r\ndecision
    not to work, or to work part-time to be there when the school\r\nbell rings at
    3.30.\r\n\r\nLimited resources (for example, the Howard Government recently de-funded\r\nthe
    Womenâ\x80\x99s Electoral Lobby) is another reason the womenâ\x80\x99s movement\r\nwould
    benefit from concentrating all its attention on traditional\r\nfeminist and unquestionably
    gender-based issues concerning women and\r\nwork - issues such as equal pay, sexual
    harassment and glass ceilings.\r\n\r\nIronically, such a concentration may also
    bring more women back into the\r\nfeminist fold because nearly all women believe
    - no matter how\r\nstridently anti-feminist their rhetoric - that they have a
    right to as\r\nmuch pay, as much safety and as much opportunity for advancement
    at work\r\nas any man.\r\n\r\nBringing men into the fight for work/family balance
    better reflects the\r\nreality and ideal of male involvement in parenting. More
    importantly,\r\nuntil working fathers start kicking up a fuss - and threatening
    to down\r\ntools, alongside working mothers - nothing is going to change.\r\n\r\nSchool
    hours are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the\r\nproblems facing
    working mothers and fathers. Working parents missed the\r\nopportunity that Howardâ\x80\x99s
    comments offered to begin a discussion at the\r\ncommunity and political level
    about the degraded quality of life they\r\nand their children have as a result
    of the incongruence between\r\ninstitutions such as school and work, and the demands
    of parenthood. It\r\nmay be that we can no longer expect the womenâ\x80\x99s movement
    to take up this\r\nfight on our behalf.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, if we use the time until
    the Governmentâ\x80\x99s next political\r\nopening organising a new movement for
    change - Iâ\x80\x99d call it Parents for\r\nBalance - we wonâ\x80\x99t have to
    see the next opportunity float by."
