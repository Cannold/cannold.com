    line of\r\nthose condemning Channel 7 for broadcasting the news that two AFL\r\nplayers
    had been referred for illicit drug use grows, we need to ask\r\nourselves: are
    we shooting the messenger?\r\n\r\nThe noisy majority contends that medical records
    are sacrosanct, and\r\nthat Seven behaved like slime not just by paying for such
    tainted goods,\r\nbut broadcasting their contents.\r\n\r\nLetâ\x80\x99s look at
    the facts. On Friday the 24th, Seven reported that two\r\nsenior AFL players had
    been referred for drugs treatment under the\r\nleagueâ\x80\x99s illicit drugs
    policy. The story came from medical records\r\nprovided by a couple in their thirties
    who claimed to have found them in\r\na gutter outside a rehabilitation centre,
    but were eventually arrested\r\nfor stealing them. The network had paid $3000
    to obtain the documents. A\r\nplayer boycott is now in force.\r\n\r\nBut while
    everyone agrees that medical records should remain\r\nconfidential, few have asked
    whether it is reasonable to assign the\r\nobligation to achieve this to a television
    network.\r\n\r\nMedical institutions and health professionals are certainly obliged
    to\r\nrespect patient confidentiality. Medical students learn early of their\r\nduty
    not just to keep mum about what happens in the consulting room, but\r\nto take
    all reasonable steps to ensure the contents of patient records\r\nare not disclosed.
    This is not just because medical practitioners have\r\nan obligation to foster
    the autonomy of their patients, but because they\r\nrecognise that people will
    only come forward for advice and treatment -\r\nparticularly about stigmatised
    conditions like abuse, mental illness and\r\nsubstance use - if they know their
    secrets will be safe.\r\n\r\nAre journalists obligated to keep patient records
    private, too? The\r\nMedia Entertainment and Arts Allianceâ\x80\x99s Code of Ethics
    notes that\r\njournalists should â\x80\x9Crespectâ\x80¦personal privacyâ\x80\x9D
    but offers little guidance\r\non how such respect should be demonstrated, or balanced
    against the\r\npublic interest. The Australian Communication and Media Authorityâ\x80\x99s\r\nGuidelines
    stipulates that news and current affair programs must not use\r\nmaterial relating
    to a personâ\x80\x99s personal or private affairs, or which\r\ninvades an individualâ\x80\x99s
    privacy, other than where there is an\r\nidentifiable public interest reason for
    the material to be broadcast.\r\n\r\nJournalists seem to agree that there was
    a case for running the story.\r\nLast Thursday, senior journalist at the Australian
    Cameron Stewart\r\ndescribed it as a â\x80\x9Ccracking yarnâ\x80\x9D that â\x80\x9Cevery
    media outlet in Melbourne\r\nwould have reportedâ\x80¦if it had come from the
    police, or the club, or from\r\nthe players themselves.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThe question
    then, is whether Channel 7 got the balance - between their\r\nobligation to protect
    the privacy of the AFL players and their duty to\r\nact in the public interest
    - right. Sevenâ\x80\x99s Melbourne news director\r\nSteve Carey contends that
    people at senior levels of sport who use\r\nillicit drugs fail to provide role
    models for kids. This view drove his\r\ndecision to run the story, though he attempted
    to balance what he saw as\r\nthe publicâ\x80\x99s right to know with the playersâ\x80\x99
    right to privacy by\r\nomitting their names - though not the name of the club
    - from the\r\nbroadcast.\r\n\r\nWas Carey right to prioritise the interests of
    his viewers in a full\r\npicture of drug use in the AFL over the playersâ\x80\x99
    and Leagueâ\x80\x99s interest\r\nin non-disclosure?\r\n\r\nCertainly, if Iâ\x80\x98d
    been in Careyâ\x80\x99s shoes that fateful night, I would have\r\nmade a different
    call. I support the AFLâ\x80\x99s three strikes policy, which\r\nappears to have
    been the indirect target of the story Seven put to air.\r\nI would have prioritised
    the playersâ\x80\x99 expectations of privacy over the\r\nstory, which I see as
    more of a â\x80\x9Câ\x80\x9Dof interest to the public\" than â\x80\x9Cin\r\nthe
    public interestâ\x80\x9D one.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the point. What matters is
    our acceptance that a\r\nbalancing act was required, even if we disagree with
    the judgment of the\r\nbalancer.\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99m not trying to bury Seven,
    or to praise the network, either. My point\r\nis simply that while we are right
    to feel angry about the unauthorized\r\ndisclosure of private medical records,
    we need to direct our anger\r\nappropriately. Seven didnâ\x80\x99t steal the medical
    records, or negligently\r\nallow them to be pinched. If they were ignorant of
    the fact they had\r\nbeen stolen (a very key if), then the network had a very
    real moral\r\ndilemma on its hands. One, it seems worth mentioning, that it and
    other\r\nnews organizations may face again.\r\n\r\nJournalists are often in receipt
    of unauthorized information, the\r\nbroadcast of which is undoubtedly in the public
    interest. Deep Throat\r\nwasnâ\x80\x99t authorized to guide Woodward and Bernstein
    to the Watergate\r\nscandal ,and Alan Kessingâ\x80\x99s confidential report on
    security breaches at\r\nSydney airport - which eventually led to a $200 million
    update of\r\nairport security - wasnâ\x80\x99t supposed to find its way into the
    press,\r\neither.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when a journalist is leaked the records
    of a candidate for\r\nhigh office who has been diagnosed with a fatal cancer he
    had failed to\r\ndisclose to the public? Or when the psychiatric records of a
    convicted\r\npedophile due for imminent release - showing several treating doctors\r\ndeeming
    him incurable and likely to re-offend - fall off the back of a\r\ntruck near a
    newsroom?\r\n\r\nWill we all be screaming about the confidentiality of medical
    records,\r\nunauthorized disclosure and privacy rights then? Will we shoot the\r\nmessenger?\r\n\r\nOr
    will we recognize the fine and fuzzy line the news media tread every\r\nday to
    keep their profits healthy, yes, but also to ensure their\r\nresponsibility to
    inform the public is met."
