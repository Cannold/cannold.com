    and truth-seeking has laid bare the\r\ntragedy and as yet unresolved questions
    surrounding her son Jakeâ\x80\x99s death\r\nin Iraq in April. A claimed leak earlier
    this week of the military board\r\nof inquiryâ\x80\x99s conclusion that Jake Kovco

    of the militaryâ\x80\x99s\r\nmishandling of the incident and its aftermath.\r\n\r\nIf
    this does turn out to be the boardâ\x80\x99s conclusion about how Jake Kovco\r\ndied,
    it is not the one his mother wants to hear. From the moment last\r\nApril when
    the Defence Minister wrongly informed the public that Kovco\r\nwas shot in the
    head while cleaning his gun - a mishap followed in short\r\norder by the militaryâ\x80\x99s
    mistaken repatriation of a Bosnian carpenter to\r\nAustralia, and the loss in
    Melbourne airport of the draft report into\r\nthis bungle - Judy has campaigned
    for the truth to be told about her\r\nsonâ\x80\x99s death. Commenting on the lost
    report she noted that it would not\r\nâ\x80\x9Cbring my son backâ\x80\x9D or â\x80\x9Ctellâ\x80¦me
    what happened to my son. Thatâ\x80\x99s what I\r\nwant to know.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nJudy
    Kovcoâ\x80\x99s approach and response to the military board of inquiry,\r\nhowever,
    point to some long-held suspicions. The separate counsel she\r\nand husband Martin
    engaged to represent them at the hearing made the\r\npoint as far back as July
    this year that, â\x80\x9CThere are three people that\r\nhad access to that firearmâ\x80\x9D.
    In response to police evidence at the\r\ninquiry that Jakeâ\x80\x99s lethal injury
    was self-inflicted, Judy is reported\r\nto have shouted â\x80\x9CKeystone Kops!â\x80\x9D
    before leaving the room. Not long\r\nafter, she appeared on TV implying that bungled
    repatriation of Jakeâ\x80\x99s\r\nbody was the consequence of a face-saving military
    cover-up. She said\r\nthere was â\x80\x9Cno way knownâ\x80\x9D that Jake would
    have shot himself purposely or\r\naccidentally, and that she would fight to obtain
    the truth for her son\r\nâ\x80\x9Cforeverâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nIn response to this
    weekâ\x80\x99s purported leak of the boardâ\x80\x99s forthcoming\r\nconclusions,
    Judy questioned the basis of any conclusion that Jake shot\r\nhimself, and the
    trustworthiness of any investigation resulting in that\r\nconclusion. â\x80\x9CThis
    was the army investigating the armyâ\x80\x9D, she said, adding\r\nthat she has
    asked for a separate coronial inquiry. â\x80\x9CI know what I have\r\nto do for
    Jake. I will fight for Jake and I will fight for the truthâ\x80¦Iâ\x80\x99m\r\nhis

    pursuit of another investigation\r\ninto the final moments of Private Jake Kovco?\r\n\r\nOn
    the one hand, she seems to have formed a view early on in the piece -\r\nwhile
    still in the early stages of shock and grief - that someone other\r\nthan Jake
    may have caused the gun to discharge. In September, months\r\nafter retaining
    separate counsel that pursued this line of inquiry, she\r\ntold a reporter that
    she was still in â\x80\x9Ccomplete shockâ\x80\x9D from the death.\r\nâ\x80\x9CI

    Judy Kovco imagined the bogey-men with whom she must do battle in\r\ndefence of
    her dead son, perhaps as a way of managing the terrible grief\r\na parent experiences
    on the death of a beloved child? Is her desire to\r\nprotect her sonâ\x80\x99s
    reputation from post-mortem slurs on his\r\nprofessionalism blinding her to the
    weight of evidence about what really\r\nhappened?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Judy
    Kovco is only pointing out what is undeniably\r\ntrue: that significant questions
    remain unanswered about the manner of\r\nJakeâ\x80\x99s death, and the way the
    military managed and investigated it. They\r\ninclude queries about how the DNA
    of one of the soldiers with Kovco at\r\nthe time wound up on Jakeâ\x80\x99s gun;
    why the military failed to seal the\r\nroom after the incident, allowing Kovcoâ\x80\x99s
    clothes to be destroyed, and\r\nthe clothes and bodies of the soldiers present
    to be washed (destroying\r\npotential forensic evidence); and the reason for the
    delayed military\r\npolice interviews of Kovcoâ\x80\x99s two roommates and others
    in the unit,\r\nallowing the soldiers to get together and talk about the event.
    As the\r\nprofile of the case grew, questions must also be asked about the wisdom\r\nof
    the militaryâ\x80\x99s insistence on investigating itself, a decision that\r\nformer
    justice George Hampel says inspires a â\x80\x9Cperception that they will\r\nlook
