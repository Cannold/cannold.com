  content: "I love Right to Life President Margaret Tighe. After years of dealing\r\nwith
    anti-choice activists who pretend their feminists, researchers, and\r\nmedical
    ethicists - anything but foot soldiers for God - her\r\nstraight-talking misogyny
    is like a breath of fresh air. With Margaret,\r\nwomen who seek abortions know
    just where they stand.\r\n\r\nTake her response to Tuesdayâ\x80\x99s announcement
    by Labor MP Candy Broad that\r\nshe will introduce a Private Memberâ\x80\x99s
    Bill to decriminalise abortion.\r\nâ\x80\x9CIf this legislation is passed, wild
    ducks in Victoria will have more\r\nprotection than unborn children.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nActually,
    wild ducks have no legal protection in Victoria, but such\r\ncomments provide
    a pithy summary of how Tighe and the tiny minority of\r\nAustralians who agree
    with her rate womenâ\x80\x99s capacities as ethical\r\ndecision makers (if you
    missed it, weâ\x80\x99re the sporting shooters from\r\nwhich our fetuses need
    legal protection). From such disdainful views of\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99s moral agency
    flow anti-choice enthusiasms for the perpetuation\r\nand enforcement of criminal
    laws they know donâ\x80\x99t stop women having\r\nabortions, but maximize the
    shame and pain they experience in doing so.\r\n\r\nSome Victorians believe that
    the current confused system - where the\r\ncriminal law prescribes jail for women
    and doctors who â\x80\x9Cprocure\r\nmiscarriagesâ\x80\x9D, but the common law
    forgives their felonious behaviour in\r\ncases where the abortion is deemed proportional
    and necessary to prevent\r\nserious danger to the womenâ\x80\x99s life or health
    - is working just fine.\r\n\r\nBut theyâ\x80\x99re wrong. The retention of statutes
    only rarely enforced makes\r\nthe law an ass. It also allows anti-choice crusaders
    wedged at various\r\npoints in the legal system to prosecute whenever they choose.
    This is\r\nwhat happened in 1986 to Queensland Drs Peter Bayliss and Dawn Cullen,\r\nin
    1998 to West Australian Drs Victor Chan and Hoh Peng Lee and to the\r\nformer
    head of the ultrasound unit at the Royal Womenâ\x80\x99s Hospital in\r\nMelbourne
    who was pursued for 6 and one half years by anti-choice\r\nLiberal politician
    Julian McGuaran before finally being cleared last\r\nyear. And when one doctor
    is prosecuted the rest get nervous, reducing\r\nthe services they provide and
    so undercutting womenâ\x80\x99s access to timely,\r\nprofessional care.\r\n\r\nBut
    love it or hate it, the introduction of Ms Broadâ\x80\x99s bill has made\r\nhistory
    of the current legal framework for abortion. Access and equity\r\nfor women can
    only go forwards - or backwards - from here. This is\r\nbecause it was one thing
    for successive parliaments to refuse to debate\r\ndecriminalization, but would
    be quite another for the 2007 Victorian\r\nParliament to affirm of the criminality
    of aborting women and their\r\ndoctors. Should Ms Broadâ\x80\x99s attempt to repeal
    abortion from the criminal\r\ncode fail, in other words, the costs to women and
    couples of\r\nreproductive age could be devastating. Not only will the stigma
    attached\r\nto abortion increase, but access will likely decline as medicos retreat\r\nto
    their bunkers to await signs of what the renewed legal landscape\r\nholds for
    them and their patients.\r\n\r\nUnplanned pregnancy is a fact of life. The World
    Health Organisation\r\nestimates that even if couples contracepted perfectly every
    time, there\r\nwould be nearly six million accidental pregnancies every year.
    At the\r\nheart of the debate on repeal is the question of who should decide.
    When\r\nHealth Minister Bronwyn Pike insists abortion canâ\x80\x99t be pulled
    out of the\r\nCrimes Act without something else being put it (rendering the entire\r\ndescriminalisation
    project moot in one fell swoop) she stands as one\r\nwith Margaret Tighe in assessing
    politicians, doctors - anyone but the\r\npregnant woman herself - as best qualified
    to know when an abortion is\r\njustified. The Premier and Treasurer Brumbyâ\x80\x99s
    support for transferring\r\nexisting common law restrictions to the Health Act
    is more of the same.\r\nAs well, they show the government, even at this early
    stage of the\r\ndebate, as running scared.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I wouldnâ\x80\x99t
    mind seeing the Premier, Brumby and the\r\nsupposedly pro-choice Health Minister
    stand up for women for a change. I\r\nmean, what else could they possibly be saying
    by insisting on the need\r\nfor legal â\x80\x9Csafeguardsâ\x80\x9D to prevent
    â\x80\x9Cunfettered accessâ\x80\x9D than that the law\r\nis the only thing that
    stops women getting pregnant will-nilly for the\r\nsheer pleasure of being able
    to abort? Not only are such claims\r\ninsulting and completely clueless about
    the way women approach the\r\ncrisis of unplanned pregnancy, they bear no basis
    in fact. The ACT\r\nrepealed abortion from the criminal code in 2002 and has reported
    no\r\nchange in procedure rates, while countries where abortion is legal and\r\naccessible,
    like Belgium and the Netherlands, enjoyi some of the lowest\r\nrates in the world.\r\n\r\nLike
    it or not, the position politicians and the public take on repeal\r\nreflects
    their view of women as moral decision-makers. Those in favour\r\ntrust womenâ\x80\x99s
    judgment on questions concerning their own bodies and\r\nlives, while those against
    donâ\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nWhatever your view, the time to express it - to Bracks,
    Brumby, Pike and\r\nmost importantly your own MP - is now. Rest assured Miargaret
    Tigheâ\x80\x99s\r\ncrew will."
