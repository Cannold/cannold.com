  content: "A reader seeks advice in resolving one of the most distressing dilemmas\r\never
    tackled by this columnist. The mother of two daughters, aged one\r\nand three,
    habitually finds herself in the holidays in the company of a\r\nchild abuser.
    This, at least, is what she has been told about the\r\nelderly father of her brotherâ\x80\x99s
    wife, who arrives each year at Christmas\r\nfrom interstate.\r\n\r\nDespite claiming
    he abused her sexually over many years as a child, the\r\nsister-in-law maintains
    a relationship with her father so she and her\r\nkids can have a relationship
    with her mother, their grandma. Despite\r\nthis, our reader says the sister-in-law
    â\x80\x9Cwill not ever leave her own\r\nchildren unattended with her father. As
    soon as my husband and I had\r\nchildren, she put us on notice about her fatherâ\x80\x99s
    past behaviour. He has\r\nnever been reported or prosecuted.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThe
    situation has left the reader feeling â\x80\x9Chijacked into being friendly\r\nto
    someone whose past actions I despiseâ\x80\x9D and compromised in her capacity\r\nto
    ensure her daughtersâ\x80\x99 safety. What should she do? Put her foot down\r\nand
    refuse to attend further holiday events, forcing her kids to â\x80\x9Cmiss\r\nout
    on wonderful times with their cousins and familyâ\x80\x9D or grit her teeth\r\nand
    continue to watch her daughters like a hawk whenever the man is\r\nnear?\r\n\r\nBoth
    are morally unsatisfactory options. Why should innocent children be\r\npunished
    by missing out on family events because of the alleged crimes\r\nof others? Why
    should their mother have to sacrifice her integrity to\r\ncover up and compensate
    for a pedophile?\r\n\r\nShe shouldnâ\x80\x99t. Which is why, in the first instance
    at least, Iâ\x80\x99d advise\r\nagainst either and recommend a private chat with
    the sister-in-law. Not\r\nonly might such a conversation provide reassurance about
    the substance\r\nof the accusations driving this dilemma, it might also allow
    our reader\r\nto ascertain whether continued silence about the abuse is really
    what\r\nthe sister-in-law wants.\r\n\r\nParents are larger than life to their
    children. Where abuse was present\r\nbut never acknowledged or atoned for, the
    adult child may still feel\r\nguilt as well as fear of the abuser, despite an
    intellectual\r\nunderstanding that they werenâ\x80\x99t at fault and that the
    abuser canâ\x80\x99t hurt\r\nthem any more.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case for the
    sister-in-law, she may want someone to stand\r\nup and speak out. Despite being
    unable or unwilling to do so herself,\r\nshe may yearn for someone else to confront
    the abuser with the enormity\r\nof his crime and demand he take responsibility
    for its rippling\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to predict the outcome of
    such a confrontation, which could\r\nbe done by post after the man returns home
    or, failing a satisfactory\r\nresponse, in person when holiday time rolls around
    again. A best-case\r\nscenario might see the man apologise and offer to observe
    restrictions\r\non his access to children or, perhaps more realistically, to claim\r\noffence
    and huffily refuse to be in attendance at next yearâ\x80\x99s events.\r\n\r\nEven
    if it goes badly - with the abuser ignoring letters or making\r\nheated denials
    in person - itâ\x80\x99s hard to see how our reader could be\r\nworse off. Options
    of self-excluding or grinning-and-bearing would\r\nremain open, though they would
    be exercised in a more agitated social\r\ncontext.\r\n\r\nBut at least her conscience
    would be clear. Because unlike now she will\r\nknow she did all she could to protect
    her children, and to refuse to\r\nstay silent about a terrible wrong."
