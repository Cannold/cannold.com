    home, have sex and forget about it. Thatâ\x80\x99s what doctors used to tell\r\ninfertile
    couples in the early days of donor insemination. Donors, too,\r\nwere assumed
    to want, and were provided with, total anonymity as a\r\ncondition for their donation.
    In some instances, no records of the event\r\n- little less non-identifying information
    about the donor - were kept.\r\n\r\nMany Australians would be matter of fact about
    donor insemination as a\r\nmeans of creating a family, but stigma still attaches
    to the procedure.\r\nPersistent confusion between male fertility and potency,
    and the\r\ninsistence of critics that it constitutes infidelity and encourages
    an\r\naddiction to masturbation is to blame. It also goes some way towards\r\nexplaining
    why the vast majority of the approximately 600 Australian\r\nchildren born every
    year from donor sperm, or more rarely eggs or\r\nembryos, are ignorant of their
    birth origins. Studies suggest that only\r\nabout 10% of such children know they
    are donor-conceived, and that only\r\n20 to 50% of parents plan to let the cat
    out of the bag at some point in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nThe cost of such secrecy
    is unclear. A handful of mental health\r\nprofessionals contend that telling traumatises
    children by disturbing\r\ntheir identity and their relationship with their social
    father, and that\r\nthe rights of parents to decide if and when to tell ought
    to be\r\nrespected. Most health professionals, however, decry family secrets as\r\ndestructive
    and concur with a vocal group of donor-conceived children\r\nthat knowledge of
    oneâ\x80\x99s genetic origins and related health information\r\nis a human right.
    They also point to the damage that can be caused by\r\naccidental disclosure,
    which can often be ill timed (adolescence appears\r\nto be a bad time to find
    out) and poorly executed. Melbourne University\r\nresearcher Maggie Kirkman tells
    of donor-conceived adults who have had\r\ntheir mothers shout â\x80\x9Canyway,
    heâ\x80\x99s not really your fatherâ\x80\x9D during an\r\nargument, or who recall
    twigging in biology class that their brown eyes\r\ncouldnâ\x80\x99t have come
    from the mating of their two blue-eyed parents.\r\nRelatives and family friends
    are also a significant disclosure risk\r\nbecause while few parents tell their
    offspring, 60% have confided in\r\nanother person: a sympathetic friend or maybe
    their mother. Such\r\nparental confidants, as Kirman sagely notes, â\x80\x9Ccan
    be expected to pass on\r\nthe information, which may eventually reach the ear
    of the\r\n[donor-conceived] child or adult.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThe proliferation
    of genetic tests available to Australians as part of\r\nroutine healthcare, and
    changes to legal regimes in many jurisdictions\r\nincluding the UK, Sweden, the
    Netherlands, New Zealand and Victoria,\r\nalso increase the risk that donor-conceived
    children will stumble across\r\nthe truth. In July, the first crop of donor-conceived
    children covered\r\nby 1988 Victorian legislation that controversially entitles
    anonymous\r\ndonors to set in train processes that will lead their biological
    child\r\nto become aware that they were conceived by donor gametes, turn 18.\r\n\r\nWhile
    we may not agree with all the reasons parents have for delaying or\r\ndeciding
    against disclosure, some may engender our sympathy. Parents\r\nfear their child
    will be distressed to discover a lack of genetic link\r\nwith one or both of them,
    particularly when, as is the case for some\r\nchildren, information about the
    donor is scant. The non-biological\r\nparent - usually the father - may worry
    his child will love him less\r\nwhen she learns there is no biological link, or
    that others will see the\r\nfamily as less than â\x80\x9Cnormalâ\x80\x9D. And
    some parents are simply so\r\nuncomfortable talking about sex, that the prospect
    of having to explain\r\nto their little ones the more complex reproductive arrangements
    that\r\nprevailed in their situation daunt them into silence.\r\n\r\nIn most Western
    countries, including Australia, the law tends to allow\r\nparents to make their
    own decisions - according to their own values -\r\nabout what is in the best interests
    of their offspring. The only\r\nexception is when the courts are convinced the
    parentâ\x80\x99s decision is\r\nputting their childâ\x80\x99s health and safety
    at risk. By allowing donors to\r\nset in train processes that will reveal to a
    child that he or she is\r\ndonor-conceived, the State government has asserted
    what it believes is\r\nin a childâ\x80\x99s best interests, and forced the hand
    of parents of\r\ndonor-conceived children in the direction of telling. Whether
    parental\r\ndenial of knowledge about genetic origins really does threaten a childâ\x80\x99s\r\nhealth
    and safety to a degree that such intervention is justified, or\r\nwhether it wrongly
    establishes donor-conceived families as second-class\r\nones, is a matter for
    debate.\r\n\r\nThe reality for parents of donor-conceived children, however, is
    that\r\nchanging social, medical realities make secret keeping an increasingly\r\nrisky
    proposition. Victorian parents must be mindful that July is around\r\nthe corner.

    Victoriaâ\x80\x99s prevailing legal regime, the time to tell is\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThe
