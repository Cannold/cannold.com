  content: "Donâ\x80\x99t blame the movement, blame the system.\r\n\r\nSIAN Prior
    (on this page last month) gave us an insight into the\r\nstresses successful young
    women experience in attempting to fit\r\nmotherhood into their high-powered lives.
    Prior protested against\r\nrepeated attempts by Cathy Sherry on this page to blame
    feminism and\r\nfeminists, rather than Australian workplace attitudes and practices,
    for\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99s inability to \\`\\`have it allâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 before
    their biological clocks\r\nstrike midnight.\r\n\r\nSherry is not alone in her
    desire to sheet home responsibility to\r\n\\`\\`feminismâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 for
    womenâ\x80\x99s distress about the\r\nwork/relationship/motherhood conflict. American
    feminists Sylvia Hewlett\r\nand Rene Denfield are just two of the women who contend
    that feminism\r\nhas failed to set priorities for the needs of the vast majority
    of its\r\nconstituency: educated middle-class women who assume theyâ\x80\x99ll
    work and\r\nplan to mother. The critics contend that feminism taught young women\r\ntheyâ\x80\x99d
    have it all, but then got derailed into male-hating, goddess\r\nworship and anti-porn
    crusades. These distractions have led to young\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99s disaffection
    from the movement, and the movementâ\x80\x99s failure to\r\nprocure the social
    policies necessary for women to pursue their\r\nfeminist-inspired dreams.\r\n\r\nWhile
    Beatrice Faust contends that such problems, and the related\r\ndisaffection of
    young women, are exclusive to the United States, young\r\nAustralian women beg
    to differ. Deakin Universityâ\x80\x99s Fiona Stewart found\r\ngen-X women exhausted
    by the clash between their expectations for their\r\nlives, and antagonistic social
    forces. They speak of glass ceilings and\r\na pervasive sense of feeling \\`\\`ripped
    offâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 by a feminism that falsely\r\nsuggested the world was their
    oyster. Such feelings contrast sharply\r\nwith the high approval ratings that
    baby boomers give the womenâ\x80\x99s\r\nmovement. These women express gratitude
    to feminism for having increased\r\ntheir self-regard, their independence and
    their opportunities for work\r\nand education.\r\n\r\nWho is right? Is it ridiculous,
    as some movement defenders claim, to\r\nblame a protest movement like feminism
    for the conditions it seeks to\r\nchange? To claim that womenâ\x80\x99s resentment
    of, or lack of interest in, the\r\nfeminist movement is simply the result (to
    quote Denfield) of tuning in\r\nto \\`\\`Channel Backlashâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99? Or
    is the feminist claim that it should be\r\nexempt from such criticism because
    of its outsider status disingenuous?\r\nIs it unjustified, as media commentator
    Catharine Lumby suggests, for\r\nfeminists to claim they are outside \\`\\`the
    power loopâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99, given the\r\ninroads the movement has made into
    government institutions, public\r\npolicy and popular debate?\r\n\r\nCertainly
    it is misguided for the old order to reply to younger womenâ\x80\x99s\r\nfeelings
    of being ripped off by feminism with backlash-type arguments.\r\nFeelings are
    feelings, resistant by nature to logical counters. If\r\nyounger women feel angry
    or indifferent about feminismâ\x80\x99s past promises\r\nor current direction,
    then that is a problem for the long-term viability\r\nof the movement. Consequently,
    those feelings must be taken seriously\r\nand addressed, pronto.\r\n\r\nWhile
    taking younger womenâ\x80\x99s views seriously does not mean treating\r\neverything
    we say as gospel, it does mean an end to explaining away our\r\nconcerns by using
    ideas such as \\`\\`false consciousnessâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99 and\r\n\\`\\`patriarchal
    brainwashingâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99. Such explanations imply we lack\r\nmaturity, media
    savvy and moral agency, and thoroughly piss us off. In\r\nfact, objections to
    the old orderâ\x80\x99s assumptions about womenâ\x80\x99s lack of\r\nmoral agency
    - not its social, rather than individualistic, explanations\r\nof female oppression
    - are behind the derogatory tagging of the old\r\norder as \\`\\`victimâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99
    feminists.\r\n\r\nWhen younger women say that the most important goal of the feminist\r\nmovement
    is to help women balance work and family, the old order must\r\nlisten. But whoâ\x80\x99s
    to say it isnâ\x80\x99t or hasnâ\x80\x99t?\r\n\r\nHowever much political, personal
    and media power and influence the\r\nfeminist movement has, few believe we live
    in a feminist world: a world\r\ndesigned around and catering to womenâ\x80\x99s
    needs and priorities. In\r\naddition to undermining the basic work protections
    upon which women\r\nrely, the Howard Government has had little time for the grass-roots\r\nfeminist
    movement or institutional feminist power bases, many of which\r\nhave been dismantled
    since the Liberals came to power. This means that\r\neven if resolving the work/motherhood
    conflict had been the number one\r\npriority of the old order, working mothers
    are unlikely to have been\r\nmuch better off than they are today.\r\n\r\nWhile
    there are legitimate points of difference between older and\r\nyounger feminists,
    it is the Government and the workplace that have\r\nreally betrayed working mothers
    and those aspiring to motherhood. And\r\nwhile new-order feminists may be right
    to grouse about the priority\r\ngrass-roots feminist organisations and femocrats
    have given to the\r\nwork/family conflict, perhaps younger women have also let
    down the\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99s movement. Grass-roots feminist organisations struggle
    to recruit\r\nyounger members, perhaps because of their failure to set priorities
    for\r\nissues that concern younger women, but also because many are busy with\r\ntheir
    families, or too busy \\`\\`doing it themselvesâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nIt is
    more than understandable that younger women are angry. We want the\r\nstruggle
    for our rights, and the things we need to access them, to be\r\nover. And we thought
    it was. But we must ensure that we direct our anger\r\nappropriately. Directing
    it to reshape grass-roots and institutional\r\nfeminist priorities to suit our
    goals is appropriate, but pretending\r\nthat feminist social analysis, or a movement
    for and about women is no\r\nlonger relevant to younger womenâ\x80\x99s realities,
    is not.\r\n\r\nWe are right to feel ripped off, but mistaken to continue that
    long\r\nfemale tradition of turning our anger in on ourselves. Weâ\x80\x99ve got
