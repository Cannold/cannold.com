  content: "The 1950s was the apex of scientists and scientific credibility. My\r\nparents,
    like most of their peers, were taken in by heroic media\r\ndepictions of Jonas
    Salk, inventor of the polio vaccine, and the\r\noutpouring of scientific ingenuity
    in the cold war race to the moon.\r\nLike many of the children of this doctor-knows
    best generation, I was\r\nformula-fed, fully vaccinated and dosed with antibiotics
    at the first\r\nsign of sore throat.\r\n\r\nOnly one of these health prescriptions-vaccination-is
    alive and well\r\ntoday, though recent claims by Jim Careyâ\x80\x99s wife Jenny
    McCarthy on Oprah\r\nthat vaccination caused her sonâ\x80\x99s autism have some
    parents running\r\nscared. At the same time, Australiaâ\x80\x99s efforts to halt
    climate change\r\nhave ground to a halt. In the wake of errors in the report by\r\nIntergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change and the â\x80\x98climategateâ\x80\x99 email\r\nrow-which
    saw British scientists accused of massaging climate data to\r\ndisguise falling
    temperatures-public distrust of climate science is at\r\nan all time high. Such
    scares and scandals, writes Hannah Devlin in the\r\nTimes Online, have â\x80\x9Cworrying
    implicationsâ\x80¦ for the integrity of\r\nscientific researchâ\x80¦and for the
    credibility of the scientific methodâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nThe scientific method provides
    a way of knowing that, like democracy,\r\nmay be the worst way of knowing things,
    except for all those other ways\r\nthat have been tried. Scientists are people
    who know how to use the\r\nmethod, and understand that only those claims that
    survive it can be\r\ncalled â\x80\x9Cfactsâ\x80\x9D or â\x80\x9Ctrue.â\x80\x9D
    The rest is just conjecture. If we want the\r\nmost reliable facts available about
    the world available, science is our\r\nmethod, and scientists the go-to boys and
    girls.\r\n\r\nBut we donâ\x80\x99t trust science-and revere scientific authorities-like
    we\r\nonce did, who is to blame? The bone is usually pointed at the media,\r\nwhich
    does bear some responsibility for the problem. This is seen most\r\nclearly in
    the climate change debate, where the standing given to the\r\ncontrary position
    of denialists gives them credibility that as mostly\r\nnon-scientists, they havenâ\x80\x99t
    earned.\r\n\r\nClimate change deniers are largely funded by conservative think-tanks\r\nthat
    are, in turn, backed by some of the biggest and wealthiest\r\ncarbon-emitting
    corporates on the planet. In one study, 78 per cent of\r\nbooks denying the reality
    of climate change or the need to act on it\r\nwere linked to conservative think
    tanks. Few of these authors had a PhD,\r\neven from less-than-relevant scientific
    disciplines like biology.\r\n\r\nDespite this, the â\x80\x9Cbalanceâ\x80\x9D requirement
    sees climate change deniers\r\nregularly trotted out and given equal standing
    on the podium with\r\nscientists with relevant expertise, or allowed to fly solo
    in extended\r\nmedia interviews. When Lord Christopher Mockton, the 3rd Viscount\r\nMonckton
    of Brenchley, British business consultant, policy adviser,\r\nwriter, columnist,
    puzzle inventor and climate change denier was in\r\nAustralia recently, he appeared
    in the media 455 times. In contrast,\r\nwhen scientist James Hansen touched down
    at about the same time-Hansen\r\nheads NASAâ\x80\x99s Goddard Institute for Space
    Studies and is an adjunct\r\nprofessor in the Department of Earth and Environmental
    Sciences at\r\nColumbia University-he gained only 61 media mentions.\r\n\r\nBut
    the power of capitalist marketing and longstanding media modus\r\noperandi are
    not solely to blame. Scientific researchers, the businesses\r\nthat commercialise
    and market their work and those who barrack\r\nuncritically for them from the
    sidelines, also bear some responsibility\r\nfor declining levels of public trust
    in science. Vaccination is a\r\nclassic case. Public health programs to support
    childhood immunisation\r\nrely on public trust that the jabs children are getting
    are both safe\r\nand effective. The health bureaucracy, medical doctors and\r\ncommunity-based
    organizations vigorously promote vaccination as part of\r\nwhat they see as their
    broader remit to lionise evidence-based medicine\r\nover unproven cures.\r\n\r\nAll
    well and good, except when real problems arise with vaccination, and\r\nsuch groups
    go to ground. Just last month, the Australian government was\r\nforced to suspend
    the national flu vaccination program for children\r\nunder five after adverse
    reactions by hundreds of children around the\r\nnation, some requiring hospitalization.
    Media reports soon raised the\r\npossibility that a â\x80\x9Ctoo cosyâ\x80\x9D
    relationship between the vaccine\r\nmanufacturer and the government may have corrupted
    decisions about its\r\nuse, and that parents had been told to give it to their
    kids before\r\nadequate safety and efficacy testing and a proper risk/benefit
    analysis\r\nhad been done.\r\n\r\nFor example, Professor Peter Collignon, an infectious
    diseases expert\r\nfrom the Australian National University, told the ABC that
    before\r\nvaccines were approved and recommended for use by government, better\r\nstudies
    and risk/benefit analyses were needed. â\x80\x9CBefore we roll out a\r\nvaccine
    to millions of peopleâ\x80¦we need to do studies of thousands of\r\npeople over
    a period of time to make sure we are always going to do more\r\ngood than harm
    with the vaccineâ\x80¦[Currently we donâ\x80\x99t have] enough data to\r\nknow
    how effective [the vaccine is] going to be.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIn the wake of the
    problem, and issues arising at around the same time\r\nwith a childhood pneumococcal
    vaccination, researchers at the Telethon\r\nInstitute for Child Health have made
    urgent calls for a whole-of-life\r\nimmunization register to help evaluate the
    safety and effectiveness of\r\nvaccination programs.\r\n\r\nSuch claims would
    no doubt be shocking to many Australians, who may have\r\nassumed that those who
    tout the importance of evidence, actually\r\npractice what they preach. Australians
    who might have assumed that the\r\nmedical interventions their government pays
    for and their doctors\r\npromote are supported by a rigorous and fulsome evidence-based:\r\notherwise
