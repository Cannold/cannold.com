    of\r\nthe Infertility Treatment Authorityâ\x80\x99s campaign to inform parents
    of how\r\nVictoriaâ\x80\x99s infertility laws may affect their lives, and parenting\r\nchoices.\r\n\r\nWeâ\x80\x99ve
    learned a lot since the Telling Campaign got under way last year.\r\nThen, the
    panic was about the legal rights of Victorian donors to\r\nidentifying information
    about any child born from their sperm or less\r\neggs. The problem was - and remains
    - that the majority of\r\ndonor-conceived kids donâ\x80\x99t know the truth about
    their conception. One\r\nVictorian study found only 37% of parents had told their
    kids, while\r\ninternational figures suggest that somewhere between 43% and 82%
    of\r\nparents never intend to tell. As the first batch of kids affected by the\r\nlegislation
    turned 18, donors choosing to pursue their rights under the\r\nlaw could have
    been the first to break the news to offspring that they\r\nwere donor-conceived.\r\n\r\nAs
    it turns out, much of that panic may have been misplaced. The truth\r\nis that
    very little was - and still is - known about the motivations of\r\nsperm donors.
    When modern infertility treatment methods were in their\r\ninfancy, donors tended
    to be young men motivated by money, and\r\nappreciative of the anonymity that
    has long surrounded donation. But as\r\ndonor-conceived children began asserting
    a â\x80\x9Cright to know,â\x80\x9D donor\r\nrecruitment strategies began to change
    and with them, the motivational\r\nprofiles of donors.\r\n\r\nA recent analysis
    of such changes suggests that when it comes to sperm\r\ndonors, you get what you
    pay for. If infertility treatment services\r\noffer men a fee for service (something
    not allowed in Australia) and\r\nguarantee them anonymity, they wind up with a
    pool of donors primarily\r\nmotivated by money and anxious to preserve their anonymity.
    If services\r\ndonâ\x80\x99t pay and require all donors to consent to being identified,
    they\r\ntend to recruit older â\x80\x9Cfamily menâ\x80\x9D with altruistic motivations
    and a\r\ncommitment to disclosure and openness.\r\n\r\nSo far, altruistic, respectful
    and compassionate appear to be good\r\ndescriptors of the pool of donors affected
    by Victoriaâ\x80\x99s 1984\r\nInfertility (Medical Procedures) Act. Descriptions
    that should perhaps\r\nnot be all that surprising given that since the middle
    of 1988, men\r\ndonating sperm in this state have known not just about their legal\r\nrights
    to seek identifying information about resulting children, but\r\ntheir obligations
    to disclose identifying information about themselves,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nThe Infertility
    Treatment Authority has been evaluating the\r\neffectiveness of the Time to Tell
    Campaign in informing parents of\r\ndonor-conceived children about what the legislation
    means for them.\r\nTheir data, made public for the first time today, suggests
    that the\r\napproximately 58 donors who gained a right to seek identifying\r\ninformation
    about just over 100 young adult in 2006 - a request that\r\nmight have disclosed
    to the donor-conceived adult time that they were\r\ndonor-conceived - were pretty
    swell guys.\r\n\r\nYes, these men had the right to apply for the identifying information\r\nthat
    Victoriaâ\x80\x99s laws - unique in this respect - granted them. And they\r\ncould
    have pursued this entitlement with little concern about the\r\npotential impact
    their voyage to knowledge might have had on the family\r\ntheir donation helped
    create.\r\n\r\nBut they didnâ\x80\x99t. Instead, the twenty-seven donors that
    contacted the ITA\r\nin search of information and support, many went away satisfied
    with an\r\napplication for non-identifying information about their offspring,
    or\r\nthe contribution of their details to the Authorityâ\x80\x99s voluntary register\r\nfor
    ready access by offspring or parents seeking information.\r\n\r\nThe few who did
    chose to exercise their lawful entitlement to\r\nidentifying information had offspring
    that had not yet reached the age\r\nof 18, meaning the childâ\x80\x99s parents
    retained the right to give - or\r\nrefuse - consent for its release. To date,
    according to the Victorian\r\nLaw Reform Commission, the majority of donors have
    respected â\x80\x9Câ\x80¦the\r\nprivacy of the recipient families and have no
    intention of applying for\r\ninformation about the person conceived with their
    gametes. Instead, they\r\nare willing to make themselves available should the
    child or young adult\r\nwish to make contact in the future.â\x80\x9D In summary,
    says the ITAâ\x80\x99s CEO\r\nLouise Johnson, â\x80\x9CDonors have been very sensitive
    to the needs of\r\nfamilies formed from their donation.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIt is
    early days yet. Two hundred more Victorians conceived by donation\r\npass through
    the portal to adulthood this year, and accompanying them\r\nwill be another lot
    of donors with unknown ideas about identity, family,\r\ngenes and privacy, to
    name just a few. Such unknowns should hasten the\r\nstate governmentâ\x80\x99s
    implementation of the Victorian Law Reform\r\nCommissionâ\x80\x99s recent recommendation
    that the right of donors to apply for\r\nidentifying information be repealed.
    It should also ensure support for\r\nthe Infertility Treatment Authorityâ\x80\x99s
    decision to accede to the requests\r\nof parents to place a note on the register
    informing information-seekers\r\nthat the child is not aware she is donor-conceived.\r\n\r\nNone
    of this is to say parents shouldnâ\x80\x99t tell. They should, and as early\r\nin
    a childâ\x80\x99s life as possible, in accordance with a growing body of\r\nresearch
    suggesting that children told before age ten find it easy to\r\nintegrate their
    non-conventional conception story into their evolving\r\nidentity. But coercion
    must be taken out of the mix and replaced with\r\nfacilitative interventions like
    the Time to Tell Campaign - supportive,\r\nrespectful, information-rich - that
    enable parents to find their own\r\ntime to tell."
