    to win the peace and the incompetent and corrupt\r\nreconstruction process, the

    have gone to war, and my\r\nagreement that a fulsome apology for past errors from
    the warâ\x80\x99s leaders\r\nis long overdue, I am not convinced that withdrawing
    our troops - now or\r\naccording to a pre-set timeline - is the right thing to
    do. Anti-war\r\npoliticians and commentators suggest that the failure of the Coalition\r\nof
    the Willing to avoid the war in the first place and to prosecute it\r\ncompetently
    and honestly once involved, provides ground for us withdraw\r\nfrom Iraq, immediately
    or in the near future. But I think the opposite\r\nmay be true: that it is precisely
    because the Coalition has made such a\r\nmess in Iraq that we may be obliged to
    stay.\r\n\r\nThe thinking behind this conclusion is not revolutionary. Say the
    fire\r\nbrigade arrives at your house and despite a complete lack of evidence
    of\r\nany fire, sprays water everywhere, causing serious damage to building\r\nand
    furnishings. You would expect the brigade to accept responsibility\r\nfor doing
    whatever you nominated as necessary to put things to right\r\n(drag carpets into
    the sun, pay to replace the sofa). You would expect\r\nthis even if the entire
    mess had been caused by their mistakenly coming\r\nto your door rather than the
    burning house down the street, or the lack\r\nof wisdom or experience that saw
    them let loose despite not seeing any\r\nflames. Columnist Thomas Friedman calls
    this the pottery store rule of\r\ncausal obligation: you break it, you own it.\r\n\r\nIraq
    Body Count estimates that a minimum of 56,102 Iraqi civilians has\r\nbeen killed
    by the war in Iraq. According to press reports, child\r\nmalnutrition has doubled
    since the invasion, reaching levels in poor\r\nAfrican countries. Bagdad residents
    suffer 70% unemployment, receive\r\nless than 6 hours a day of electricity and
    mostly live with sewage and\r\nwithout potable water. Precipitous declines in
    household incomes since\r\nthe war mean that half the countryâ\x80\x99s people
    now live below the poverty\r\nline.\r\n\r\nTodayâ\x80\x99s Iraq is indeed broken,
    and good arguments can be made that this\r\nis in substantial part a consequence
    of the war and the Coalitionâ\x80\x99s\r\nfailings when it came to the hard work
    of â\x80\x9Cwinning the peaceâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nDespite this, it is the rare politician
    who takes account of our\r\nobligations to the Iraqis for the mess weâ\x80\x99ve
    made in propounding their\r\nproposed solution to the crisis. Instead, the case
    for surging,\r\nsuper-surging, downscaling or withdrawing is largely made with
    reference\r\nto the demands of protecting US prestige, fostering national or world\r\nsecurity
    or avoiding further troop losses. Many commentators, well aware\r\nof appalling
    moral breaches in the conduct of the war (ranging from the\r\nritual humiliation
    of Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison to the\r\nconstruction by contractors
    with strong links to the Bush administration\r\nof key building projects that
    leak human sewage through the walls) have\r\nadopted a similarly self-referential
    line.\r\n\r\nNone of this is to say that American and Australian politicians and\r\ncommentators
    - not to mention the American and Australian peoples -\r\nshould not be concerned
    with the well-being of our troops, and the\r\nsecurity of our nations. We have
    obligations in this regard, too.\r\nRather, it is simply to note that it is unseemly
    to debate our future\r\ninvolvement in conflict-ridden Iraq without reference
    to\r\nresponsibilities generated by our past decisions and their negative\r\nconsequences
    for Iraqâ\x80\x99s civilian population.\r\n\r\nHow best to fulfil these obligations?
    Some might say a Coalition\r\nwithdrawal is the only way. The Bush administration
    has been so corrupt\r\nand incompetent in its prosecution of the war and peace
    that the best\r\nresponse to the resulting plight of Iraqis is to clear out of
    the way.\r\nAlternatively, it could be argued that the only way for the US and\r\nAustralia
    to get it right in Iraq is to commit to doing whatever it\r\ntakes for as long
    as it takes to at least leave things - income levels,\r\nchild health, sanitation
    and security - as we found them (sans the\r\ndictator of course, which could be
    our way of saying â\x80\x9Csorryâ\x80\x9D for all the\r\nintervening inconvenience
    and suffering).\r\n\r\nIt is this sort of debate that I think we should be having.
    One about\r\nprecisely what strategies will best enable us to meet our obligations

    the moral foundations right."
