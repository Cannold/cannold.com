    leading up to a coup that delivered Australia its first female\r\nPrime Minister.
    Such losses are an inevitable part of an unpredictable\r\nnews cycle, but sometimes
    they must be resisted. Some stories are just\r\ntoo important to let fall off
    the radar.\r\n\r\nOne such story concerns former Senior Detective Scott Gladman.
    Gladman\r\nwas the officer charged with investigating rape allegations made by
    a 19\r\nyear old woman against AFL footballer Stephen Milne six years ago. The\r\ncase
    was eventually dropped. In a statement-released at the time and\r\nagain when
    the story resurfaced-police said they had concluded on the\r\nbasis of advice
    from the Director of Public Prosecutions and the results\r\nof â\x80\x9Ca thorough
    investigationâ\x80\x9D that there was insufficient evidence to\r\nprosecute the
    sportsman.\r\n\r\nGladman tells a different tale, one backed up by his fellow\r\ninvestigating
    officer Mike Smith, another ex-cop. A tale of being\r\nhounded and pressured by
    fellow members of the force to â\x80\x9Cmake it go\r\nawayâ\x80\x9D and not â\x80\x9Cdo
    the job as best you can.â\x80\x9D A tale of being told the\r\nwoman was â\x80\x9Cjust
    one of those footy slutsâ\x80\x9D and of police being contacted\r\ndirectly by
    those with â\x80\x9Cvested interest in the possible outcome for the\r\nclub.â\x80\x9D
    A story of player interview tapes being stolen from desks and\r\ntranscripts of
    interview found on a photocopier, and of the\r\nalleged-victimâ\x80\x99s statement
    being leaked to the club, revealing her\r\nidentity. And a tale of the senior
    officers to whom Gladman complained -\r\nthose in charge of the sexual crimes
    squad and assistant commissioner of\r\nthe region at the time-failing to respond
    to his concerns and do all\r\nthat they could to make things right.\r\n\r\nThankfully,
    the Office of Police Integrity are now investigating, with\r\nthe Chief Commissioner
    promising to re-open the investigation if\r\nallegations that police deliberately
    sought to compromise it can be\r\nproved.\r\n\r\nThe initial findings of such
    probes have been explosive, with raids on\r\nthe criminal investigation unit uncovering
    the loss of crucial, and\r\nmostly irreplaceable, evidence including master tapes
    of initial\r\ninterviews, reports from lead investigators and parts of the brief
    of\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nGladman makes plain that he thinks the case against Milne
    should have\r\ngone ahead, and a jury left to decide the playerâ\x80\x99s guilt
    or innocence.\r\nâ\x80\x9CThere is a prima facie case still sitting there in that
    box at that\r\noffice that should be answered by a jury,â\x80\x9D he said. â\x80\x9CStephen
    Milne is an\r\ninnocent person until heâ\x80\x99s proven guilty in a court of
    law. However, we\r\nnever got that far, because theâ\x80¦natural flow of justice
    was\r\ninterrupted.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nHe said that telling the woman that, â\x80\x9Cthe
    brief had been put to bedâ\x80\x9D was\r\none of the worst experiences of his
    career. For colleague Mike Smith, it\r\nwas a turning point. He says he lost â\x80\x9Câ\x80¦a
    hell of a lot of faith.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIt is this part of the story that moves
    me most. The startling\r\nrevelation that in a modern Australian policeforce.
    there appears no\r\nplace for these two good men. Indeed, it may be Gladmanâ\x80\x99s
    and Smithâ\x80\x99s\r\nabundant integrity-demonstrated in their initial pursuit
    of justice\r\nwithout fear or favour, and their insistence on seeking it again-that\r\nmakes
    them such a poor fit with contemporary police culture.\r\n\r\nA culture in which
    what some cops seem to think matters most is â\x80\x9Cto be\r\nseen to be more
    important in their eyes to the club â\x80¦ [by doing]\r\nanything they c[an] â\x80¦
