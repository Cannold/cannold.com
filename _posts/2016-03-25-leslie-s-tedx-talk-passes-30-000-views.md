    Or maybe I didnâ\x80\x99t. Why does it matter?\r\n\r\nAbortion shame is very zeitgeist
    at the moment. Or, more precisely and far more happily, anti-shame is very zeitgeist.
    In The New York Times, in a number of online magazines and on websites like 1
    in 3, 45 Million Voices and Exhale women are speaking out. Theyâ\x80\x99re resisting
    the shame by breaking their silence about their abortions.\r\n\r\nBut the success
    of this fledgling speak-out movement is far from guaranteed. Indeed if we want
    it to succeed we are going to have to help. But before I can tell you what it
    is that you can do to stand up for women, I really need to take you on a bit of
    a 360 around shame. I need to talk to you about what it is, how it works and what
    it does to its victims.\r\n\r\nSo I thought what I would ask you to do is just
    actually stop looking at me for a minute, and have a look around you. So look
    at your neighbours, smile at them, weâ\x80\x99re at TED â\x80\x93 â\x80\x9Citâ\x80\x99s
    cool!â\x80\x9D(does a little dance) â\x80\x93 and now focus in on the women. So
    just meet the eyes of the women and smile while I tell you that one in three of
    those women will have an abortion in her lifetime. Now that would be true if this
    were an Australian audience or a British audience or an American audience. One
    in three women will have an abortion in their lifetime. And if you havenâ\x80\x99t
    yet, you can stop looking at each other now.\r\n\r\nNow there are a lot of ways
    that I could have made that point. I could have thrown something like this up
    on the screen (illustration of 1 in 3 women) and I could have said â\x80\x9COne
    in three Australian, British and American women will have an abortion in their
    lifetimeâ\x80\x9D. I could have said â\x80\x9CAccording to the World Health Organisation,
    abortion â\x80\x93 medical or surgical â\x80\x93 is one of the safest and most
    common medical procedures. But itâ\x80\x99s not the same, is it? What if I had
    said â\x80\x9COk, have a look around at everybody in the audience, focus in on
    the women while I tell you that every single one of those women in the next five
    years is going to blow her noseâ\x80\x9D. Not the same.\r\n\r\nThat is shame.\r\n\r\nWe
    actually arenâ\x80\x99t born feeling ashamed of anything. Weâ\x80\x99re not ashamed
    of our nakedness, weâ\x80\x99re not ashamed of our bodily functions, our sexual
    desires, our reproduction or abortion. We learn, from our communities, what is
    shameful. And it is the real or perceived oversight of those communities that
    make us feel shame.\r\n\r\nNow shame is about fear, but what are we afraid of?
    This is Renee Brown (shows picture on screen). She gave a fantastic TED talk â\x80\x93
    which I really commend to you â\x80\x93 about shame and when I went screaming
    off to find her academic work. And what I discovered was that according to Brown,
    what shame IS, is the acutely anxiety inducing experience that we are flawed and
    that others are going to find out. That we are flawed in comparison to other people
    and other people are going to find that out. And when they do, theyâ\x80\x99re
    going to demean us, or ridicule us, or judge us and cast us out.\r\n\r\nSo Iâ\x80\x99ve
    used that word cast out for a reason. And the reason is that Iâ\x80\x99m trying
    to underscore the fact that the consequences that people fear, the fear that shame
    evokes in people, the consequences they fear of being shamed are very, very real.
    Theyâ\x80\x99re very, very significant.\r\n\r\nSo in ancient times, if a woman
    brought shame on her name, or her family, or her community she could literally
    be thrown out of that community. Cast out. She could be stoned. In some places
    in the world today, that is still the case.\r\n\r\nIn our world, a woman might
    be afraid if people find out that sheâ\x80\x99s had an abortion that her church
    community will evict her. Or she might be worried that her family, or her boyfriend,
    or her husband might throw her out of the house. Or that her friends will start
    a whisper campaign about her. But the thing is, that those fears all cut to something
    very, very essential about us; very, very primal. And indeed that is why shame
    is such an ancient form of social control. Because it actually goes to something
    that may be hardwired in us. Which is this desire to stay in connection with other
    human beings. Shame evokes the fear of disconnection.\r\n\r\nI had an abortion.
    Or maybe I didnâ\x80\x99t. Why do you care?\r\n\r\nThatâ\x80\x99s the shame cycle
    (Diagram of shame=silence=ignorance etc.). Shame equals silence equals ignorance.
    But before I can tell you and will tell you about that silence and that ignorance
    and how it hurts women I wanna tell you one thing that shame doesnâ\x80\x99t do.\r\n\r\nShame
    does not stop women having abortions.\r\n\r\nNow the data on this is not great
    and Iâ\x80\x99m a researcher so I care about this kind of stuff, and itâ\x80\x99s
    not great because itâ\x80\x99s difficult data to get and because abortion is stigmatised
    so the research funding isnâ\x80\x99t there. But from what we can tell, shame
    does not stop many, if any women from having abortions. But that doesnâ\x80\x99t
    mean it doesnâ\x80\x99t hurt women. It does. And it hurts them by silencing them
    and by causing ignorance. So letâ\x80\x99s talk about that.\r\n\r\nSilent women
    canâ\x80\x99t ask for support. Two thirds of women fear that if others find out
    their abortion they will look down on them and so, nearly that number â\x80\x93
    58 to 60% â\x80\x93 donâ\x80\x99t tell their friends and their family about their
    abortion and talk about their abortion little or not at all.\r\n\r\nSilent women
    canâ\x80\x99t share information. So if I reach out to someone and say â\x80\x9COh
    my God, Iâ\x80\x99ve got, Iâ\x80\x99m pregnant when I donâ\x80\x99t wanna be,
    I donâ\x80\x99t know what to doâ\x80\x9D and someone says to me â\x80\x9COh you
    know, thatâ\x80\x99s terrible, like that happened to me too and hereâ\x80\x99s
    how I felt and hereâ\x80\x99s how it went and I went to this clinic and it was
    terrific or I went to that one and it wasnâ\x80\x99t so good but WHATEVER you
    do if you go to this one, be really careful because across the street, thereâ\x80\x99s
    a building thatâ\x80\x99s dolled up to look like the abortion clinic but itâ\x80\x99s
    actually not an abortion clinic at all. Itâ\x80\x99s run by a pro-life agency
    and by the time you even work out where you are, they will have told you a whole
    bunch of false information about abortion, they may have told you youâ\x80\x99re
    going to hell, and by the time you stumble out of there youâ\x80\x99ll have missed
    your appointment.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nSilent women DONâ\x80\x99T ask for the laws
    they need and deserve. And indeed this was actually how I came into the shame
    issue because I am an abortion rights activist. And in order to change the laws,
    to try to get things out of the law that hurt women, to try to put things into
    the law to protect women, I actually need to raise awareness amongst decision
    makers and amongst the public that there is a problem. So if you think about any
    news item that youâ\x80\x99ve ever seen or a newspaper article about some broad
    social issue, youâ\x80\x99ll see that it starts with a story. It starts with a
    story of a particular person and thatâ\x80\x99s so that it doesnâ\x80\x99t seem
    so abstract and you can actually see that this broad social issue thatâ\x80\x99s
    being spoken about is actually hurting someone and thatâ\x80\x99s why it is, we
    need to make the effort to change things.\r\n\r\nBut if I canâ\x80\x99t get women
    to tell their stories, I canâ\x80\x99t get things in the media. Or if I do get
    them in the media, I get them buried at the back of the news bulletin or at the
    back of the paper where they have less influence. I couldnâ\x80\x99t even get
    women to come to Canberra and talk to politicians. And that means that itâ\x80\x99s
    really hard for me to make some of the changes that I wanna make.\r\n\r\nSo youâ\x80\x99ve
    gotta ask yourself; if shame is so bad for women, then why is it still happening?
    And who is doing it?\r\n\r\nWell the answer to whoâ\x80\x99s doing it is the Shame
    Stokers. And the reason is that shame is a gift that just keeps on giving. Shame
    equals silence equals ignorance equals shame equals silence equals more ignorance
    equals more shame and more silence and more ignorance. And that silence and that
    ignorance is the fertiliser for the ground on which repressive abortion laws and
    policies flourish.\r\n\r\nSo I wanna give you a bit of a feel for what Shame Stoking
    looks and sounds like. Because the weird thing is that women whoâ\x80\x99ve had
    abortions can hear it and it is around us all the time. But people who arenâ\x80\x99t
    tuned into it canâ\x80\x99t hear it. So itâ\x80\x99s really important that you
    see it, you hear it and you recognise when itâ\x80\x99s about. Ok, so hereâ\x80\x99s
    some examples, and I should say to you that I could have picked from thousands,
    so this is really just a tasting plate.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxI6HGpaP3Q\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CA
    legacy of unutterable shame.â\x80\x9D That was said by an Australian Health Minister,
    who said that Australiaâ\x80\x99s abortion rate was a national tragedy that left
    a legacy of unutterable shame.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CVaginally penetrated when they
    got pregnant.â\x80\x9D This was said very recently by an American legislator who
    was one of a number whoâ\x80\x99s trying to change laws, and indeed some of these
    laws have been successfully implemented, that require a woman who is seeking abortion
    to have an ultrasound. But you see most women who have abortions have them very
    early on in pregnancy, which means that kind of usual ultrasound doesnâ\x80\x99t
    work. You canâ\x80\x99t see anything; itâ\x80\x99s all just too small. So, instead,
    they mandate that a probe be inserted inside that woman. This is a non-medically
    indicated, trans-vaginal ultrasound. The womanâ\x80\x99s doctor is forced to give
    it to her, even though thereâ\x80\x99s no medical reason for it and she may have
    denied consent. And when it was pointed out to this legislator that in any other
    context you would call that rape, he essentially said â\x80\x9CWell, we donâ\x80\x99t
    have to worry about those sort of women because, after all, they were vaginally
    penetrated when they got pregnant.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nAnd our final Shame Stoking
    is â\x80\x9Cabortion is a worse moral scandal than priests sexually abusing young
    peopleâ\x80\x9D. This was said by a Catholic Archbishop, again not long ago, to
    a group of young people. And I just wanna stop for a minute on this one, and just
    underscore what is really being said here. So what is being said is, the moral
    evil that we need to concern ourselves about is NOT men in positions of authority
    and trust who rape children and or then cover it up. The REAL moral problem of
    our time is women who have abortions.\r\n\r\nSo thereâ\x80\x99s a couple of messages
    that the Shame Stokers are sending us there.\r\n\r\nOne message is DIRECT to women
    whoâ\x80\x99ve had abortions. So what theyâ\x80\x99re worried about is if they
    talk about their abortion, theyâ\x80\x99ll be shamed and judged and cast out.
    And the Shame Stokers are saying to them â\x80\x9Cyou bet your LIFE you will.
    You put your head above the parapet Missy and we will kick you in the teeth.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nAnd
    the second message the Shame Stokers are sending is to all of us. And itâ\x80\x99s
    really a lesson worth learning. And it is this. That if you donâ\x80\x99t tell
    your own story, other people will tell that story for you. Silence does not stay
    silent for long.\r\n\r\nSo. This is an optimistic challenge, right. And Iâ\x80\x99ve
    just dragged ya right down into the mud. Do not worry because we are heading up!
    And the reason we are heading up is because there is absolutely nothing that I
    have just told you that you can not do something about.\r\n\r\n(Crowd starts applauding)
    You bet! You bet!\r\n\r\nCommunities cause shame. And communities can stop it.
    So letâ\x80\x99s talk about what you can do.\r\n\r\nReach out. (Photo of two hands
    holding, â\x80\x9CYou are not aloneâ\x80\x9D written on their arms.) Women whoâ\x80\x99ve
    had abortions who feel supported experience less shame. And less of shameâ\x80\x99s
    noxious, down stream consequences. So let the women in your world know that you
    are NOT a Shame Stoker. That if they talk to you about a problem pregnancy or
    an abortion, you will NOT judge them. You will NOT shame them. But YOU will listen
    with empathy and compassion, and let them know that they are not alone.\r\n\r\nYou
    can dance. (Photo of a woman wearing a T-shirt that says â\x80\x9CAbortion. A
    fact of life. Letâ\x80\x99s end the stigma.) At the end of this month in Melbourne,
    women, and men are going to get out onto the street wearing T-shirts like that
    and theyâ\x80\x99re going to say exactly that. â\x80\x9CWe are not Shame Stokers.â\x80\x9D
    They are going to say to women â\x80\x9CWe wanna stand up for you and AGAINST
    abortion shameâ\x80\x9D. And we are hoping, umm, Reproductive Choice Australia
    is hoping â\x80\x93 â\x80\x98cause weâ\x80\x99re organising this event â\x80\x93
    we are desperately hoping itâ\x80\x99s gonna catch on like wildfire; we want it
    to go right around the globe; we want communities everywhere to kick this sort
    of positive, uplifting message to send out to the women in their community that
    says â\x80\x9CThe time for shame is overâ\x80\x9D. And if you canâ\x80\x99t get
    to one of those flashmobs and/or if you do go and you wanna do something else,
    you can actually take that precise pledge online. You can pledge that you will
    not engage in abortion shaming and you will not tolerate it when others do so.
    So please keep an eye out for that opportunity.\r\n\r\nSo if you do all that,
    what do you get? So instead of this negative, downward cycle -of shame equals
    silence equals ignorance which causes more shame and more silence and more ignorance
    â\x80\x93 you get an upward spiral. (Diagram of empathy=connection=empowerment,
    etc.).\r\n\r\nYou get, empathy equals connection equals empowerment equals empathy
    equals connection equals empowerment for women. So, some of you may have seen
    this, Iâ\x80\x99ll just give you a quick chance to just run your eyes over it.
    I in no way mean to disrespect the person who said this. Ok, he said, he was one
    of the first people to speak out against the Naziâ\x80\x99s and he deserves heaps
    of respect. But Iâ\x80\x99ve put it up there because the truth is that I donâ\x80\x99t
    really like it.\r\n\r\n(Quote by Martin Niemoller. â\x80\x9CFirst they came for
    the Socialists, and I did not speak out because I was not a Socialist. Then they
    came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out because I was not a Trade
    Unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not
    a Jew. Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me.â\x80\x9D)\r\n\r\nAnd
    I donâ\x80\x99t really like it because, even though itâ\x80\x99s true, even though
    it is true â\x80\x93 that one of the reasons we act morally is because weâ\x80\x99re
    worried that if we donâ\x80\x99t stand up for people â\x80\x93 women who have
    abortions, say â\x80\x93 that women who have abortions wonâ\x80\x99t stand up
    for us. That is true. But Iâ\x80\x99m looking for something morally, much bigger
    than that.\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99m looking for something more Lady Diana. Who in the
    midst of the Aids crisis, when people were seeking to shun and stigmatise and
    judge and cast out anybody who was thought to have the virus and gay men; she
    started REACHING out her hand to touch those people and to shake their hands.\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99m
    looking for something more like the King of Denmark, who the apocryphal story
    goes â\x80\x93 when the Naziâ\x80\x99s came into Denmark and said â\x80\x9CYou
    have to brand all your Jews with a starâ\x80\x9D he said â\x80\x9CWell, fine.
    But if thatâ\x80\x99s gonna happen, Iâ\x80\x99m gonna wear a star too and so is
    every Dane.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99m looking for people who wanna say â\x80\x9CNot
    by my hand, not on my watch, because I am the strong one. And standing up for
    women against abortion shame â\x80\x93 it is just the right thing to do.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nAnd
    so. I had an abortion. Or maybe I didnâ\x80\x99t. But I hope by now you know,
    that it doesnâ\x80\x99t matter either wayâ\x80¦because we wonâ\x80\x99t be silent
    any more.\r\n\r\nThank you."

    pregnant when I donâ\x80\x99t wanna be, I donâ\x80\x99t know what to doâ\x80\x9D
    and someone says to me â\x80\x9COh you know, thatâ\x80\x99s terrible, like that
    happened to me too and hereâ\x80\x99s how I felt and hereâ\x80\x99s how it went
    and I went to this clinic and it was terrific or I went to that one and it wasnâ\x80\x99t
    so good but WHATEVER you do if you go to this one, be really careful because across
    the street, thereâ\x80\x99s a building thatâ\x80\x99s dolled up to look like the
    abortion clinic but itâ\x80\x99s actually not an abortion clinic at all. Itâ\x80\x99s
    run by a pro-life agency and by the time you even work out where you are, they
    will have told you a whole bunch of false information about abortion, they may
    have told you youâ\x80\x99re going to hell, and by the time you stumble out of
    there youâ\x80\x99ll have missed your appointment.â\x80\x9D</p>\n\n<p>Silent women
    DONâ\x80\x99T ask for the laws they need and deserve. And indeed this was actually
    how I came into the shame issue because I am an abortion rights activist. And
    in order to change the laws, to try to get things out of the law that hurt women,
    to try to put things into the law to protect women, I actually need to raise awareness
    amongst decision makers and amongst the public that there is a problem. So if
    you think about any news item that youâ\x80\x99ve ever seen or a newspaper article
    about some broad social issue, youâ\x80\x99ll see that it starts with a story.
    It starts with a story of a particular person and thatâ\x80\x99s so that it doesnâ\x80\x99t
    seem so abstract and you can actually see that this broad social issue thatâ\x80\x99s
    being spoken about is actually hurting someone and thatâ\x80\x99s why it is, we
    need to make the effort to change things.</p>\n\n<p>But if I canâ\x80\x99t get
    women to tell their stories, I canâ\x80\x99t get things in the media. Or if I
    do get them in the media, I get them buried at the back of the news bulletin or
    at the back of the paper where they have less influence. I couldnâ\x80\x99t even
    get women to come to Canberra and talk to politicians. And that means that itâ\x80\x99s
    really hard for me to make some of the changes that I wanna make.</p>\n\n<p>So
    youâ\x80\x99ve gotta ask yourself; if shame is so bad for women, then why is it
    still happening? And who is doing it?</p>\n\n<p>Well the answer to whoâ\x80\x99s
    doing it is the Shame Stokers. And the reason is that shame is a gift that just
    keeps on giving. Shame equals silence equals ignorance equals shame equals silence
    equals more ignorance equals more shame and more silence and more ignorance. And
    that silence and that ignorance is the fertiliser for the ground on which repressive
    abortion laws and policies flourish.</p>\n\n<p>So I wanna give you a bit of a
    feel for what Shame Stoking looks and sounds like. Because the weird thing is
    that women whoâ\x80\x99ve had abortions can hear it and it is around us all the
    time. But people who arenâ\x80\x99t tuned into it canâ\x80\x99t hear it. So itâ\x80\x99s
    really important that you see it, you hear it and you recognise when itâ\x80\x99s
    about. Ok, so hereâ\x80\x99s some examples, and I should say to you that I could
    have picked from thousands, so this is really just a tasting plate.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxI6HGpaP3Q</p>\n\n<p>â\x80\x9CA
    legacy of unutterable shame.â\x80\x9D That was said by an Australian Health Minister,
    who said that Australiaâ\x80\x99s abortion rate was a national tragedy that left
    a legacy of unutterable shame.</p>\n\n<p>â\x80\x9CVaginally penetrated when they
    got pregnant.â\x80\x9D This was said very recently by an American legislator who
    was one of a number whoâ\x80\x99s trying to change laws, and indeed some of these
    laws have been successfully implemented, that require a woman who is seeking abortion
    to have an ultrasound. But you see most women who have abortions have them very
    early on in pregnancy, which means that kind of usual ultrasound doesnâ\x80\x99t
    work. You canâ\x80\x99t see anything; itâ\x80\x99s all just too small. So, instead,
    they mandate that a probe be inserted inside that woman. This is a non-medically
    indicated, trans-vaginal ultrasound. The womanâ\x80\x99s doctor is forced to give
    it to her, even though thereâ\x80\x99s no medical reason for it and she may have
    denied consent. And when it was pointed out to this legislator that in any other
    context you would call that rape, he essentially said â\x80\x9CWell, we donâ\x80\x99t
    have to worry about those sort of women because, after all, they were vaginally
    penetrated when they got pregnant.â\x80\x9D</p>\n\n<p>And our final Shame Stoking
    is â\x80\x9Cabortion is a worse moral scandal than priests sexually abusing young
    peopleâ\x80\x9D. This was said by a Catholic Archbishop, again not long ago, to
    a group of young people. And I just wanna stop for a minute on this one, and just
    underscore what is really being said here. So what is being said is, the moral
    evil that we need to concern ourselves about is NOT men in positions of authority
    and trust who rape children and or then cover it up. The REAL moral problem of
    our time is women who have abortions.</p>\n\n<p>So thereâ\x80\x99s a couple of
    messages that the Shame Stokers are sending us there.</p>\n\n<p>One message is
    DIRECT to women whoâ\x80\x99ve had abortions. So what theyâ\x80\x99re worried
    about is if they talk about their abortion, theyâ\x80\x99ll be shamed and judged
    and cast out. And the Shame Stokers are saying to them â\x80\x9Cyou bet your LIFE
    you will. You put your head above the parapet Missy and we will kick you in the
    teeth.â\x80\x9D</p>\n\n<p>And the second message the Shame Stokers are sending
    is to all of us. And itâ\x80\x99s really a lesson worth learning. And it is this.
    That if you donâ\x80\x99t tell your own story, other people will tell that story
    for you. Silence does not stay silent for long.</p>\n\n<p>So. This is an optimistic
    challenge, right. And Iâ\x80\x99ve just dragged ya right down into the mud. Do
    not worry because we are heading up! And the reason we are heading up is because
    there is absolutely nothing that I have just told you that you can not do something
    about.</p>\n\n<p>(Crowd starts applauding) You bet! You bet!</p>\n\n<p>Communities
    cause shame. And communities can stop it. So letâ\x80\x99s talk about what you
    can do.</p>\n\n<p>Reach out. (Photo of two hands holding, â\x80\x9CYou are not
    aloneâ\x80\x9D written on their arms.) Women whoâ\x80\x99ve had abortions who
    feel supported experience less shame. And less of shameâ\x80\x99s noxious, down
    stream consequences. So let the women in your world know that you are NOT a Shame
    Stoker. That if they talk to you about a problem pregnancy or an abortion, you
    will NOT judge them. You will NOT shame them. But YOU will listen with empathy
    and compassion, and let them know that they are not alone.</p>\n\n<p>You can dance.
    (Photo of a woman wearing a T-shirt that says â\x80\x9CAbortion. A fact of life.
    Letâ\x80\x99s end the stigma.) At the end of this month in Melbourne, women, and
    men are going to get out onto the street wearing T-shirts like that and theyâ\x80\x99re
    going to say exactly that. â\x80\x9CWe are not Shame Stokers.â\x80\x9D They are
    going to say to women â\x80\x9CWe wanna stand up for you and AGAINST abortion
    shameâ\x80\x9D. And we are hoping, umm, Reproductive Choice Australia is hoping
    â\x80\x93 â\x80\x98cause weâ\x80\x99re organising this event â\x80\x93 we are
    desperately hoping itâ\x80\x99s gonna catch on like wildfire; we want it to go
    right around the globe; we want communities everywhere to kick this sort of positive,
    uplifting message to send out to the women in their community that says â\x80\x9CThe
    time for shame is overâ\x80\x9D. And if you canâ\x80\x99t get to one of those
    flashmobs and/or if you do go and you wanna do something else, you can actually
    take that precise pledge online. You can pledge that you will not engage in abortion
    shaming and you will not tolerate it when others do so. So please keep an eye
    out for that opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>So if you do all that, what do you get? So
    instead of this negative, downward cycle -of shame equals silence equals ignorance
    which causes more shame and more silence and more ignorance â\x80\x93 you get
    an upward spiral. (Diagram of empathy=connection=empowerment, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>You
    get, empathy equals connection equals empowerment equals empathy equals connection
    equals empowerment for women. So, some of you may have seen this, Iâ\x80\x99ll
    just give you a quick chance to just run your eyes over it. I in no way mean to
    disrespect the person who said this. Ok, he said, he was one of the first people
    to speak out against the Naziâ\x80\x99s and he deserves heaps of respect. But
    Iâ\x80\x99ve put it up there because the truth is that I donâ\x80\x99t really
    like it.</p>\n\n<p>(Quote by Martin Niemoller. â\x80\x9CFirst they came for the
    Socialists, and I did not speak out because I was not a Socialist. Then they came
    for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out because I was not a Trade Unionist.
    Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I was not a Jew.
    Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me.â\x80\x9D)</p>\n\n<p>And
    I donâ\x80\x99t really like it because, even though itâ\x80\x99s true, even though
    it is true â\x80\x93 that one of the reasons we act morally is because weâ\x80\x99re
    worried that if we donâ\x80\x99t stand up for people â\x80\x93 women who have
    abortions, say â\x80\x93 that women who have abortions wonâ\x80\x99t stand up
    for us. That is true. But Iâ\x80\x99m looking for something morally, much bigger
    than that.</p>\n\n<p>Iâ\x80\x99m looking for something more Lady Diana. Who in
    the midst of the Aids crisis, when people were seeking to shun and stigmatise
    and judge and cast out anybody who was thought to have the virus and gay men;
    she started REACHING out her hand to touch those people and to shake their hands.</p>\n\n<p>Iâ\x80\x99m
    looking for something more like the King of Denmark, who the apocryphal story
    goes â\x80\x93 when the Naziâ\x80\x99s came into Denmark and said â\x80\x9CYou
    have to brand all your Jews with a starâ\x80\x9D he said â\x80\x9CWell, fine.
    But if thatâ\x80\x99s gonna happen, Iâ\x80\x99m gonna wear a star too and so is
    every Dane.â\x80\x9D</p>\n\n<p>Iâ\x80\x99m looking for people who wanna say â\x80\x9CNot
    by my hand, not on my watch, because I am the strong one. And standing up for
    women against abortion shame â\x80\x93 it is just the right thing to do.â\x80\x9D</p>\n\n<p>And
    so. I had an abortion. Or maybe I didnâ\x80\x99t. But I hope by now you know,
    that it doesnâ\x80\x99t matter either wayâ\x80¦because we wonâ\x80\x99t be silent
    any more.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n"

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxI6HGpaP3Q\r\n\r\nI had an abortion. Or maybe
  I didnâ\x80\x99t. Why does it matter?\r\n\r\nAbortion shame is very zeitgeist at
  the moment. Or, more precisely and far more happily, anti-shame is very zeitgeist.
  In The New York Times, in a number of online magazines and on websites like 1 in
  3, 45 Million Voices and Exhale women are speaking out.<!--break--> Theyâ\x80\x99re resisting
  the shame by breaking their silence about their abortions.\r\n\r\nBut the success
  of this fledgling speak-out movement is far from guaranteed. Indeed if we want it
  to succeed we are going to have to help. But before I can tell you what it is that
  you can do to stand up for women, I really need to take you on a bit of a 360 around
  shame. I need to talk to you about what it is, how it works and what it does to
  its victims.\r\n\r\nSo I thought what I would ask you to do is just actually stop
  looking at me for a minute, and have a look around you. So look at your neighbours,
  smile at them, weâ\x80\x99re at TED â\x80\x93 â\x80\x9Citâ\x80\x99s cool!â\x80\x9D(does
  a little dance) â\x80\x93 and now focus in on the women. So just meet the eyes of
  the women and smile while I tell you that one in three of those women will have
  an abortion in her lifetime. Now that would be true if this were an Australian audience
  or a British audience or an American audience. One in three women will have an abortion
  in their lifetime. And if you havenâ\x80\x99t yet, you can stop looking at each
  other now.\r\n\r\nNow there are a lot of ways that I could have made that point.
  I could have thrown something like this up on the screen (illustration of 1 in 3
  women) and I could have said â\x80\x9COne in three Australian, British and American
  women will have an abortion in their lifetimeâ\x80\x9D. I could have said â\x80\x9CAccording
  to the World Health Organisation, abortion â\x80\x93 medical or surgical â\x80\x93
  is one of the safest and most common medical procedures. But itâ\x80\x99s not the
  same, is it? What if I had said â\x80\x9COk, have a look around at everybody in
  the audience, focus in on the women while I tell you that every single one of those
  women in the next five years is going to blow her noseâ\x80\x9D. Not the same.\r\n\r\nThat
  is shame.\r\n\r\nWe actually arenâ\x80\x99t born feeling ashamed of anything. Weâ\x80\x99re
  not ashamed of our nakedness, weâ\x80\x99re not ashamed of our bodily functions,
  our sexual desires, our reproduction or abortion. We learn, from our communities,
  what is shameful. And it is the real or perceived oversight of those communities
  that make us feel shame.\r\n\r\nNow shame is about fear, but what are we afraid
  of? This is Renee Brown (shows picture on screen). She gave a fantastic TED talk
  â\x80\x93 which I really commend to you â\x80\x93 about shame and when I went screaming
  off to find her academic work. And what I discovered was that according to Brown,
  what shame IS, is the acutely anxiety inducing experience that we are flawed and
  that others are going to find out. That we are flawed in comparison to other people
  and other people are going to find that out. And when they do, theyâ\x80\x99re going
  to demean us, or ridicule us, or judge us and cast us out.\r\n\r\nSo Iâ\x80\x99ve
  used that word cast out for a reason. And the reason is that Iâ\x80\x99m trying
  to underscore the fact that the consequences that people fear, the fear that shame
  evokes in people, the consequences they fear of being shamed are very, very real.
  Theyâ\x80\x99re very, very significant.\r\n\r\nSo in ancient times, if a woman brought
  shame on her name, or her family, or her community she could literally be thrown
  out of that community. Cast out. She could be stoned. In some places in the world
  today, that is still the case.\r\n\r\nIn our world, a woman might be afraid if people
  find out that sheâ\x80\x99s had an abortion that her church community will evict
  her. Or she might be worried that her family, or her boyfriend, or her husband might
  throw her out of the house. Or that her friends will start a whisper campaign about
  her. But the thing is, that those fears all cut to something very, very essential
  about us; very, very primal. And indeed that is why shame is such an ancient form
  of social control. Because it actually goes to something that may be hardwired in
  us. Which is this desire to stay in connection with other human beings. Shame evokes
  the fear of disconnection.\r\n\r\nI had an abortion. Or maybe I didnâ\x80\x99t.
  Why do you care?\r\n\r\nThatâ\x80\x99s the shame cycle (Diagram of shame=silence=ignorance
  etc.). Shame equals silence equals ignorance. But before I can tell you and will
  tell you about that silence and that ignorance and how it hurts women I wanna tell
  you one thing that shame doesnâ\x80\x99t do.\r\n\r\nShame does not stop women having
  abortions.\r\n\r\nNow the data on this is not great and Iâ\x80\x99m a researcher
  so I care about this kind of stuff, and itâ\x80\x99s not great because itâ\x80\x99s
  difficult data to get and because abortion is stigmatised so the research funding
  isnâ\x80\x99t there. But from what we can tell, shame does not stop many, if any
  women from having abortions. But that doesnâ\x80\x99t mean it doesnâ\x80\x99t hurt
  women. It does. And it hurts them by silencing them and by causing ignorance. So
  letâ\x80\x99s talk about that.\r\n\r\nSilent women canâ\x80\x99t ask for support.
  Two thirds of women fear that if others find out their abortion they will look down
  on them and so, nearly that number â\x80\x93 58 to 60% â\x80\x93 donâ\x80\x99t tell
  their friends and their family about their abortion and talk about their abortion
  little or not at all.\r\n\r\nSilent women canâ\x80\x99t share information. So if
  I reach out to someone and say â\x80\x9COh my God, Iâ\x80\x99ve got, Iâ\x80\x99m
  pregnant when I donâ\x80\x99t wanna be, I donâ\x80\x99t know what to doâ\x80\x9D
  and someone says to me â\x80\x9COh you know, thatâ\x80\x99s terrible, like that
  happened to me too and hereâ\x80\x99s how I felt and hereâ\x80\x99s how it went
  and I went to this clinic and it was terrific or I went to that one and it wasnâ\x80\x99t
  so good but WHATEVER you do if you go to this one, be really careful because across
  the street, thereâ\x80\x99s a building thatâ\x80\x99s dolled up to look like the
  abortion clinic but itâ\x80\x99s actually not an abortion clinic at all. Itâ\x80\x99s
  run by a pro-life agency and by the time you even work out where you are, they will
  have told you a whole bunch of false information about abortion, they may have told
  you youâ\x80\x99re going to hell, and by the time you stumble out of there youâ\x80\x99ll
  have missed your appointment.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nSilent women DONâ\x80\x99T ask for
  the laws they need and deserve. And indeed this was actually how I came into the
  shame issue because I am an abortion rights activist. And in order to change the
  laws, to try to get things out of the law that hurt women, to try to put things
  into the law to protect women, I actually need to raise awareness amongst decision
  makers and amongst the public that there is a problem. So if you think about any
  news item that youâ\x80\x99ve ever seen or a newspaper article about some broad
  social issue, youâ\x80\x99ll see that it starts with a story. It starts with a story
  of a particular person and thatâ\x80\x99s so that it doesnâ\x80\x99t seem so abstract
  and you can actually see that this broad social issue thatâ\x80\x99s being spoken
  about is actually hurting someone and thatâ\x80\x99s why it is, we need to make
  the effort to change things.\r\n\r\nBut if I canâ\x80\x99t get women to tell their
  stories, I canâ\x80\x99t get things in the media. Or if I do get them in the media,
  I get them buried at the back of the news bulletin or at the back of the paper where
  they have less influence. I couldnâ\x80\x99t even get women to come to Canberra
  and talk to politicians. And that means that itâ\x80\x99s really hard for me to
  make some of the changes that I wanna make.\r\n\r\nSo youâ\x80\x99ve gotta ask yourself;
  if shame is so bad for women, then why is it still happening? And who is doing it?\r\n\r\nWell
  the answer to whoâ\x80\x99s doing it is the Shame Stokers. And the reason is that
  shame is a gift that just keeps on giving. Shame equals silence equals ignorance
  equals shame equals silence equals more ignorance equals more shame and more silence
  and more ignorance. And that silence and that ignorance is the fertiliser for the
  ground on which repressive abortion laws and policies flourish.\r\n\r\nSo I wanna
  give you a bit of a feel for what Shame Stoking looks and sounds like. Because the
  weird thing is that women whoâ\x80\x99ve had abortions can hear it and it is around
  us all the time. But people who arenâ\x80\x99t tuned into it canâ\x80\x99t hear

  when itâ\x80\x99s about. Ok, so hereâ\x80\x99s some examples, and I should say to

  children and or then cover it up. The REAL moral problem of our time is women who
  have abortions.\r\n\r\nSo thereâ\x80\x99s a couple of messages that the Shame Stokers
  are sending us there.\r\n\r\nOne message is DIRECT to women whoâ\x80\x99ve had abortions.
  So what theyâ\x80\x99re worried about is if they talk about their abortion, theyâ\x80\x99ll
  be shamed and judged and cast out. And the Shame Stokers are saying to them â\x80\x9Cyou
  bet your LIFE you will. You put your head above the parapet Missy and we will kick
  you in the teeth.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nAnd the second message the Shame Stokers are sending
  is to all of us. And itâ\x80\x99s really a lesson worth learning. And it is this.
  That if you donâ\x80\x99t tell your own story, other people will tell that story
  for you. Silence does not stay silent for long.\r\n\r\nSo. This is an optimistic
  challenge, right. And Iâ\x80\x99ve just dragged ya right down into the mud. Do not
  worry because we are heading up! And the reason we are heading up is because there
  is absolutely nothing that I have just told you that you can not do something about.\r\n\r\n(Crowd
  starts applauding) You bet! You bet!\r\n\r\nCommunities cause shame. And communities
  can stop it. So letâ\x80\x99s talk about what you can do.\r\n\r\nReach out. (Photo
  of two hands holding, â\x80\x9CYou are not aloneâ\x80\x9D written on their arms.)
  Women whoâ\x80\x99ve had abortions who feel supported experience less shame. And
  less of shameâ\x80\x99s noxious, down stream consequences. So let the women in your
  world know that you are NOT a Shame Stoker. That if they talk to you about a problem
  pregnancy or an abortion, you will NOT judge them. You will NOT shame them. But
  YOU will listen with empathy and compassion, and let them know that they are not
  alone.\r\n\r\nYou can dance. (Photo of a woman wearing a T-shirt that says â\x80\x9CAbortion.
  A fact of life. Letâ\x80\x99s end the stigma.) At the end of this month in Melbourne,
  women, and men are going to get out onto the street wearing T-shirts like that and
  theyâ\x80\x99re going to say exactly that. â\x80\x9CWe are not Shame Stokers.â\x80\x9D
  They are going to say to women â\x80\x9CWe wanna stand up for you and AGAINST abortion
  shameâ\x80\x9D. And we are hoping, umm, Reproductive Choice Australia is hoping
  â\x80\x93 â\x80\x98cause weâ\x80\x99re organising this event â\x80\x93 we are desperately
  hoping itâ\x80\x99s gonna catch on like wildfire; we want it to go right around
  the globe; we want communities everywhere to kick this sort of positive, uplifting
  message to send out to the women in their community that says â\x80\x9CThe time
  for shame is overâ\x80\x9D. And if you canâ\x80\x99t get to one of those flashmobs
  and/or if you do go and you wanna do something else, you can actually take that
  precise pledge online. You can pledge that you will not engage in abortion shaming
  and you will not tolerate it when others do so. So please keep an eye out for that
  opportunity.\r\n\r\nSo if you do all that, what do you get? So instead of this negative,
  downward cycle -of shame equals silence equals ignorance which causes more shame
  and more silence and more ignorance â\x80\x93 you get an upward spiral. (Diagram
  of empathy=connection=empowerment, etc.).\r\n\r\nYou get, empathy equals connection
  equals empowerment equals empathy equals connection equals empowerment for women.
  So, some of you may have seen this, Iâ\x80\x99ll just give you a quick chance to
  just run your eyes over it. I in no way mean to disrespect the person who said this.
  Ok, he said, he was one of the first people to speak out against the Naziâ\x80\x99s
  and he deserves heaps of respect. But Iâ\x80\x99ve put it up there because the truth
  is that I donâ\x80\x99t really like it.\r\n\r\n(Quote by Martin Niemoller. â\x80\x9CFirst
  they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out because I was not a Socialist.
  Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out because I was not
  a Trade Unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out because I
  was not a Jew. Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me.â\x80\x9D)\r\n\r\nAnd
  I donâ\x80\x99t really like it because, even though itâ\x80\x99s true, even though
  it is true â\x80\x93 that one of the reasons we act morally is because weâ\x80\x99re
  worried that if we donâ\x80\x99t stand up for people â\x80\x93 women who have abortions,
  say â\x80\x93 that women who have abortions wonâ\x80\x99t stand up for us. That
  is true. But Iâ\x80\x99m looking for something morally, much bigger than that.\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99m
  looking for something more Lady Diana. Who in the midst of the Aids crisis, when
  people were seeking to shun and stigmatise and judge and cast out anybody who was
  thought to have the virus and gay men; she started REACHING out her hand to touch
  those people and to shake their hands.\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99m looking for something
  more like the King of Denmark, who the apocryphal story goes â\x80\x93 when the
  Naziâ\x80\x99s came into Denmark and said â\x80\x9CYou have to brand all your Jews
  with a starâ\x80\x9D he said â\x80\x9CWell, fine. But if thatâ\x80\x99s gonna happen,
  Iâ\x80\x99m gonna wear a star too and so is every Dane.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99m
  looking for people who wanna say â\x80\x9CNot by my hand, not on my watch, because
  I am the strong one. And standing up for women against abortion shame â\x80\x93
  it is just the right thing to do.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nAnd so. I had an abortion. Or
  maybe I didnâ\x80\x99t. But I hope by now you know, that it doesnâ\x80\x99t matter
  either wayâ\x80¦because we wonâ\x80\x99t be silent any more.\r\n\r\nThank you."
