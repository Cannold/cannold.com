  content: "[[What__No_Baby_cover_art|class=right]] \n\n*What, No Baby?* takes us
    on journey into the lives of contemporary women who plan to have it all - marriage,
    motherhood and work - yet have been derailed by reluctant men, insatiably demanding
    jobs and ever-climbing expectations of what it takes to be a \"good\" mother.\n\nThe
    Australian Bureau of Statistics predicts that 25% of Australian women currently
    in their reproductive years will never have children. Yet respected researcher
    and ethicists Leslie Cannold argues that women want to mother as much as they
    ever did. What has changed is their willingness to sacrifice everything they've
    built - everything they are - to do so. Drawing on demographic data. social research
    and insights gained from interviews with women in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, Cannold
    shows that the easier society makes it for women to combine parenthood and paid
    work, the closer women get to having the number of children they want.\n\nAt the
    end of the 21st century, it is women's freedom to mother that is most at risk.
    Guaranteed to reshape the current debate around sustained low fertility, *What,
    no baby?* is a must-red for everyone concerned about Australia's fertility rate
    and for women who want to better understand - and to solve - the social problems
    keeping them from fulfilling lives in which children play a part. \n\nInterested

    book I have read about the dilemma facing young women in their choice - or lack
    thereof - today... If Cannold challenges the public agenda as effectively as she

    Saying About** ***What, No Baby?***\n\n> *I have just read (rather, devoured)
    your book \"What, No Baby?\". I am currently going through a break up with a truly
    wonderful man, because he is desperate to have children now, while I am 98% decided
    that I never want them. (In any case, I certainly don't want them \"in time\"
    for him.) My indecision has come from a suspicion that there was information I
    wasn't considering; as you said, the happy parents are deafeningly silent on the
    positives of having children.*\n\n> *Those parents who do try to convince me I
    should have children, or that I'll regret it one day, say things like \"who will
    look after you when you're old\" and \"it's all worth it when they say 'I love
    you'\". Reason one is clearly ridiculous and invalid, while reason two reminds
    me of friends of mine who have tried to justify remaining in physically abusive
    relationships. Yet there didn't seem to be any other reasons!*\n\n> *In contrast,
    your book opened my eyes to considerations that I have not encountered in FOUR
    YEARS of research through various avenues. I came to question how much of my \"choice\"
    is really valid, since in this case I want to be true to my heart, not to my head.
    I certainly bristle at the realisation that it is to a great extent society that
    is driving this very personal choice of mine.*\n\n> *Through your book, I've been
    able to more objectively take apart and reasses the various factors I've considered.
    Most importantly, I've been able to see through the peripherals to the core of
    it - the fact remains that I feel no strong desire for motherhood, even with all
    of those outside influences aside.*\n\n> *In truth I have always felt quite a
    strong - even physical - aversion to the thought of pregnancy, breast feeding,
    and especially to the corny gaga roses-and-cottonwool visions of motherhood as
    a necessary ingredient of true womanhood.*\n\n> *You have helped me to reconsider
    the validity and true motivations behind my \"choice\" and in so doing, you have
    guided me to becoming more sure of my decision, more aware of its repercussions,
    and better armed in the struggle to be respected by those who prefer to take other
    paths in life and feel that I should too. You've given me clarity in choosing
    how to proceed (or not to) in my current relationship and taken away some of the
    guilt I have felt in not being the \"normal, proper and whole\" woman that my
    partner wants me to be.*\n\n> *Finally, after wading through a great deal of militant,
    stupid and nasty childfree rhetoric which is met by equally militant, stupid and
    nasty pro-parenting rhetoric, you have been a refreshingly open minded and non-blaming
    voice amongst the muck of useless bitterness on both sides.*\n\n> *Thank you very
