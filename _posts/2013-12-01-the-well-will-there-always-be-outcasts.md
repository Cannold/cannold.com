    and why, even in modern times, we appear unable â\x80\x93 or unwilling â\x80\x93
    to live without them.\r\n\r\nThis wonder has seeped into my fiction. At the climax
    of The Book of Rachael, Rachael skulks on the edge of a mob struggling to make
    sense of the brutal execution of her rebellious brother, Joshua. But the group
    seeks more than understanding. They are also determined to strengthen the bonds

    up to the disappointing fact that the betrayer could not be killed for his crime
    because he was already dead, they would look for someone else to pay. Someone
    whose kinship with the betrayer demonstrated her guilt and put beyond question
    the rectitude of exacting payment from her in blood. In this way would the mob
    affirm who they were becoming by whom they reviled. \r\n\r\nMoments later, I was

    others is a key means by which human beings cement their own membership of the
    in-group. Humans are social creatures and the search for belonging is one of the
    five key motives driving how we act in groups (indeed, some argue that belonging
    is the motive driving all social behaviour and that shared understanding, control,
    self-enhancement, and trust are mere sub-categories of our drive to belong).\r\n\r\nReviling
    others and casting them out defines, in the reverse, who we respect and accept.
    Belonging, unsurprisingly, helps us feel secure because it is the primary means
    by which social goods (like friendship and influence) and material goods (like
    land and jobs) are dispensed. You must be one of us â\x80\x93 an Australian citizen
    or resident â\x80\x93 to benefit from our universal healthcare system. Similarly,
    anxiety wrought by globalisation over who will gain access to â\x80\x98new avenues
    of riches and powerâ\x80\x99 are behind violent persecutions in Africa of those
    stigmatized as â\x80\x98strangers.â\x80\x99\r\n\r\nOne of the most firmly established
    relationships in social research is the relationship between perceived similarity
    and social behaviour. If I think youâ\x80\x99re like me in appearance, attitudes,
    personality traits, and group memberships, Iâ\x80\x99m more likely to treat you
    empathetically, be your friend and do nice things for you. The reverse is also
    true. The less like me I see you as being, the more likely I am to avoid and despise
    you. Itâ\x80\x99s easy to see how resulting senses of affiliation or alienation
    from our fellow humans lead to ethnic, racial and religious violence like the
    Holocaust and the Rwandan genocide.\r\n\r\nSo much for being judged on the content
    of our character! And this is the nub of the problem. But before we attempt to
    resolve it, we must first take note of the key insight offered by American researcher
    Gordon Allport, one of the most influential social researchers in the area of
    bias, prejudice and discrimination. Classification, Allport warns, is inevitable.
    There is simply too much information available in the world and taxonomies are
    necessary for us to process information speedily enough to function.\r\n\r\nWhere
    does that leave us? If the way we treat our fellow is reliant on quick and dirty
    character assessments like race, gender, age, language and accent â\x80\x93 and
    our inclination to like and reward those whose superficial qualities are most
    like our own â\x80\x93 how will a fair and equitable world be achieved?\r\n\r\nAt
    the heart of international anti-discrimination law is the insight that opportunities
    for paid employment, advancement and recognition must be based on â\x80\x98merit
    and the ability to do a job,â\x80\x99 not characteristics irrelevant to undertaking
    the task. But where this does not happen, and the â\x80\x98haveâ\x80\x99sâ\x80\x99
    persist in doling out benefits like citizenship, employment and friendship to
    those of similar gender, race and religion â\x80\x93 rather than on merit â\x80\x93
    how can the â\x80\x98have-notsâ\x80\x99 fight back?\r\n\r\nThey can fight back.
    Not by eliminating superficial stereotypes, but by displacing them. Allport says
    orderly living depends on categorisation, but this doesnâ\x80\x99t specify what
    rules-of-thumb humans will deploy. Indeed, across time and cultures, different
    societies have relied on different irrelevant qualities to create â\x80\x98inâ\x80\x99
    and â\x80\x98outâ\x80\x99 groups.\r\n\r\nAnother of Allportâ\x80\x99s assertions,
    that inter-group conflict would be reduced through contact â\x80\x93 where the
    two groups share similar tasks and status and are involved in personal activities
    that promote meaningful interpersonal interactions â\x80\x93 has been validated
    by more than fifty years of empirical research.\r\n\r\nContact that reduces conflict
    between groups must include four elements. Members of both groups must expect
    and perceive equal status in a situation, say, through membership of an inter-racial
    sports team. The common goal of winning shared by all team members is another
    key component of contact likely to reduce conflict. There must also be intergroup
    cooperation, like that seen in a study that sorted Australian children into groups
    balanced on gender, ethnicity, academic ability and racial lines. Engaged in a
    jigsaw classroom activity, the grade 4 to 6 students were forced to depend on
    one another to attain their final grade. Finally, for contact to succeed in reducing
    inter-group conflict, group engagements must have the support of authorities,
    laws or customs. Why? Because according to academic Thomas Pettigrew such authority
    â\x80\x98establishes norms of acceptance.â\x80\x99\r\n\r\nCould children and adults
    be better trained to deploy narrower and less random categories, in place of broader
    and irrelevant ones like race and gender, in order to distinguish those who are
    similar and unlike themselves? Arguably we are succeeding at this mission when
    we look at whatâ\x80\x99s happening in New South Wales with â\x80\x98bikies.â\x80\x99
    As interpersonal contact and education have now rendered overt racial and gender
    discrimination unacceptable, motorcycle gang membership may be the substitute
    categorisation by which some in the human family can be easily branded, reviled
    and legally and socially cast out."
