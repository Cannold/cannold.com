  content: "There were a lot of contenders for this weekâ\x80\x99s column. The inevitable\r\narrival
    of paid maternity leave on the list of scuttled government\r\ninitiatives because
    of the global economic crisis was one. Minister\r\nStephen Conroyâ\x80\x99s decision
    to capitulate to the demands of the religious\r\nright and censor everyoneâ\x80\x99s
    internet access was another. And thereâ\x80\x99s a\r\npiece inside me just screaming
    to get out about what former government\r\nleaders must really think about the
    quality of reporting on the ABC\r\ngiven their decision to participate in The
    Howard Years, the first\r\nepisode of which screened on ABC TV this week.\r\n\r\nBut
    Iâ\x80\x99ve decided to throw politics to one side and to focus instead on\r\nmatters
    far closer to home. To point the bone at wrong-doers far too\r\ncommonplace in
    my world-the dumpers and the martyrs.\r\n\r\nDumpers are those who treat the wide
    range of people who â\x80\x9Cdoâ\x80\x9D their\r\nâ\x80\x9Cpersonal careâ\x80\x9D
    as emotional sinks. Cashed-up folk who act as if the men\r\nand women they have
    paid to train them at the gym, cut and colour their\r\nhair, trim and paint their
    nails, massage away their pains, peel and\r\nscrub their faces and wax their backs
    or bikini lines are also being\r\npaid to pamper their psyches.\r\n\r\nDumpers
    say things like this. â\x80\x9CI was thinking about getting a bit of\r\nfringe
    because I wanted something different. I am starting to look my\r\nage.â\x80\x9D
    They say, â\x80\x9CYou know what itâ\x80\x99s like in London. And now the service\r\nis
    even worse.â\x80\x9D They say, â\x80\x9CI went to that new gym I was telling you\r\nabout.
    Very reasonably priced but it was a bit rushed. I just want to go\r\nafterwards
    and have my coffee and my afternoon but I just donâ\x80\x99t know.\r\nItâ\x80\x99s
    so hard to know what to do.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThey say these things to hairdressers
    whose best friends will never grow\r\nold because they died that week in a car
    accident. They say them to\r\nmanicurists who have never been to London and will
    never go because they\r\ncanâ\x80\x99t afford to take a holiday. Ever. They say
    them to personal trainers\r\nwho have mortgaged themselves to the hilt to buy
    their own gym, but may\r\nnow go broke because their wives just left them.\r\n\r\nDo
    dumpers know this? Most of them do, and if they donâ\x80\x99t, they should.\r\nThey
    should because finding out requires nothing more then the temporary\r\nshutting
    of their own trap, and the responding to the other like they\r\nwere an actual
    human being with worries and aspirations of their own,\r\nrather than a creature
    who exists for no other purpose then to service\r\ntheir needs.\r\n\r\nWhich brings
    me to the martyrs. Dumpers act like their most trivial\r\npsychological desideratum
    is weightier than any needs of those lower\r\ndown on the food chain. Martyrs
    pretend they have no emotional needs at\r\nall, then spend the time and energy
    necessary to achieve world peace in\r\nmanipulative efforts designed to get those
    needs met. How many\r\ngrandmothers does it take to change a light bulb? Oh donâ\x80\x99t
    worry about\r\nme, dear, Iâ\x80\x99ll just sit in the dark.\r\n\r\nMartyrs snatch
    your coffee cup while youâ\x80\x99re still packing up from the\r\nmeeting, then
    sigh and flounce as they do the washing up. They insist\r\nthat that the favour
    youâ\x80\x99ve asked is no trouble, then spend the rest of\r\nyour natural life
    sniffing about ingratitude when the medal and monument\r\nfail to arrive.\r\n\r\nRefusing
    to ask for what you want, or to say no to what you donâ\x80\x99t, is a\r\nsure-fire
    recipe for dissatisfaction, but thatâ\x80\x99s OK because it is the\r\ninevitable
    moral failures of others on which martyrs get off. They get\r\nemotional satisfaction,
    in other words, from being the unrecognised\r\ndo-er of good deeds.\r\n\r\nMy
    friend, who grew up with a martyr, says you canâ\x80\x99t win and you need to\r\nstop
    trying. Instead, he advises, try to have fun. Leave long lists\r\ndetailing your
    requirements. Dirty as many dishes as you can. â\x80\x9CTheyâ\x80\x99re\r\ngoing
    to feel hardly-done by, anyway,â\x80\x9D he says, shrugging. â\x80\x9CMight as\r\nwell
    make â\x80\x98em work for their pay.â\x80\x9D"
