  content: "\"Look for the power.\" I don't know if this was the first lesson my sociology
    professor taught me but it's the one I most remember. If you want to know why
    the world looks as it does, follow the power.\r\n\r\nChanging the world requires
    a similar insight. This one I gained in the Sydney offices of GetUp!, which at
    that time was helping to end the effective ban on the so-called abortion pill,
    RU486. The then-director stood before a whiteboard. As each procedural avenue
    for reaching our shared goal was discussed, he would ask, \"Who calls the shots?\"\r\n\r\nNowhere
    is power more in play than in the area of industrial relations. Yet, in most discussions
    of this contentious area of public policy, the P-word is rarely heard.\r\n\r\nGoogle
    \"industrial relations\" and \"power\" and the most prominent hit is an academic
    article decrying the neglect of power in industrial relations theory.\r\n\r\nIn
    a 48-minute ABC Background Briefing on the Qantas industrial dispute, \"power\"
    was mentioned just twice. Both references were to union power â\x80\x93 specifically,
    employer anxieties that union power might sabotage corporate ambitions for a more
    employer-friendly industrial landscape once the Coalition returned to government.\r\n\r\nSo
    what gives? If power is so key to understanding how the world works and how it
    can be made to change, why don't we talk more about it?\r\n\r\nI think it's because
    most of us see the use of power (defined as the ability to direct or influence
    others and the course of events) as synonymous with the abuse of power. \r\n\r\nThey're
    not the same but where power concentrates, the age-old adage that \"absolute power
    corrupts absolutely\" will prove true.\r\n\r\nWhen employers talk of union power,
    the image we get is of power unchecked; of thugs determining outcomes in their
    own interests, not the needs of the workers they're meant to represent. Even a
    cursory glance at Australia's history â\x80\x93 indeed, its current Parliament
    â\x80\x93 leaves no doubt that the perception that some unions abuse their power
    is true.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether power is sought to pursue self-interest
    or to organise to defend the interests of the weak or save the planet, power must
    be checked or corruption will follow as sure as night follows day.\r\n\r\nWhat
    we must glean from this fact is that in the industrial relations arena, the best
    chance of power being used wisely and in the service of the public good is for
    it to be distributed fairly. This is because what has been historically true is
    still true today. A lone worker, especially if she's unskilled and there's plenty
    more where she came from, can't negotiate a fair outcome from her employer because
    she doesn't have enough power. One way of increasing her pull is through a union.\r\n\r\nAnyone
    who doubts the importance of the role honest unions play in evening out the power
    imbalance between employers and individual workers should listen to National Public
    Radio's expose of Foxconn, the Chinese firm that makes our iPhones. In China,
    unions are outlawed and workers who use the officially advertised mechanisms for
    redressing exploitation can be blacklisted as troublemakers.\r\n\r\nFoxconn calls
    forth our own sweatshop past and is a timely reminder of what the world of work
    looks like when there are no laws or institutions to stop employers having it
    their way.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
