    weeks, revelations about match-fixing in tennis and rumours that the NSW Independent
    Commission Against Corruption will make no adverse findings against public officials
    behaving badly raises concerns that sometimes those with a case to answer may
    walk free.\r\n\r\nWhether the watchdogs won't or can't act is hard to say. The
    head of the Tennis Integrity Unit contends that, \"corruption is very difficult
    to detect and to obtain the evidence to prosecute\". ICAC was stymied by a High
    Court decision that limited the types of corruption it was authorised to investigate.\r\n\r\nThe
    perception that the top end of town is subject to different standards to the rest
    of us has disastrous consequences for the morale and morality of society as a
    whole.\r\n\r\nIn short, we lose faith, not just in the honesty and integrity of
    those who play for Australia and are sworn to represent our interests, but in
    all those with money and power. And if they're all crooks, we reason, why should
    we refrain from stealing and lying when doing so could increase our wealth and
    power? Surely in a world where cheaters prosper, insisting on honesty and integrity
    makes us nothing more than chumps.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion is understandable, but
    it's also wrong. Yes, it's true that most people will cheat if they think they
    will get away with it. This means anti-corruption measures must be baked into
    any system that can be gamed. It also requires citizens to fight for the proper
    regulation of business, sport and politics, as well as the flourishing of a free
    and public-minded press, willing and able, as The Guardian's Michael White argues,
    \ \"to take on the bad boys, arouse public opinion and see the challenge through
    to the courts despite the threats of overpaid gagging lawyers\".\r\n\r\nAt the
    same time, we need to accept that although the blunt instrument of the law is
    necessary, it will always be insufficient to detect wrongdoing and â\x80\x93 by
    bringing the perpetrator to justice â\x80\x93 deter others from doing the same.
    Into thIs considerable gap must come ethics. We need to teach it to our children
    from at least prep to year 6, and optimally, through the senior school years too.\r\n\r\nEthics
    is a subset of philosophy, and philosophy programs for children as young as five
    exist in some Australian schools. My own children went through a program at their
    primary school, which was outstanding. They learnt how to listen, take turns,
    reason and argue. They enjoyed every minute of it and emerged from the program
    as critical thinkers capable of contributing constructively to the our democratic
    society, which requires an informed and inquiring citizenry.\r\n\r\nProperly taught,
    ethics reinforces the need for careful listening and respectful argumentation
    by supporting children to explore and debate difficult questions such as, should
    drug smugglers be executed? Is it OK to lie, and what is love?\r\n\r\nAcademic
    reviews of such programs have found that children are more than capable of engaging
    in age-appropriate ethical inquiry. It helps them clarify and articulate their
    own values, to learn and understand the different views of their classmates and
    to modify their own under the weight of further evidence.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is
    that when school starts this week, only Victoria will have ethics instruction
    in the curriculum where it belongs, so it can be delivered with the authority
    and expertise of qualified teachers. Elsewhere in the country, where ethics is
    offered, it's provided by volunteers and positioned as an alternative to special
    religious instruction or scripture.\r\n\r\nThis is a false dichotomy, and forces
    too many children to miss out. Scripture classes do not purport to teach ethics
    and the evidence shows they don't. What they provide to children of a particular
    religion is instruction on the basic tenets of that faith.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside
    the contested question as to whether this sort of instruction is appropriate in
    Australia's secular schools, what is beyond question is that ethics should be
    made available to all children, whether or not scripture is provided during school
    hours or their parents choose to enrol them in it.\r\n\r\nIf we believe that our
    democracy, our economy and our sport will run a whole lot better with people of
    integrity at the helm â\x80\x93 not people who only do the right thing when they're
    confident of getting caught â\x80\x93 then we must equip the next generation with
    the core skills they need to be the honest brokers of tomorrow. We need to teach
    them â\x80\x93 every single one of them â\x80\x93 ethics.\r\n\r\n\"Cheaters never
    prosper\" is a modern phrase, though a  similar idea hails from the 17th century.
    Found in John Harrington's Epigrams, it comes with an ironic twist. \"Treason
    doth never prosper, what's the reason? For if it prosper, none dare call it treason.\"\r\n\r\nThe
    twist reminds us that keeping humans honest, and preserving the values of honesty
    in society, have never been child's play. But now that ethics is, we might finally
    have found the answer.\r\n\r\nLeslie Cannold is an ethicist, researcher and public
    speaker on gender, values-driven leadership and respectful relationships.\r\n\r\nThis
