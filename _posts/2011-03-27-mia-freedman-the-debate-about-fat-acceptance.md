  content: "NOT long ago Mia Freedman tweeted, ''If you have to ask, your bum does
    look big in that. #rulesforlife''.\r\n\r\nShe immediately drew fire about the
    sentiment and about it being made by someone who claims to be a body image activist
    (Freedman chaired the National Body Image Advisory Group). Some even questioned
    the Fairfax columnist and former magazine editor's claim to that title in the
    first place.\r\n\r\nAmong those throwing bombs were fativists, or members of the
    fat acceptance movement. Among the beliefs of such activists - who meet largely
    online - is that bodies are diverse, all people deserve to be treated with respect,
    no matter their shape or size, and that stereotyping, vilifying and discriminating
    against fat people is counterproductive and wrong. Fativists advocate a social
    and policy agenda grounded in a ''health at any size'' approach to wellness and
    see the size of their body as their business - not ours. They say fat people should
    be consulted about public health interventions designed to reduce their size.\r\n\r\nI'm
    on board with the fat acceptance message - to a point. I certainly agree, and
    have argued in print and on radio, that demonising obesity is counterproductive,
    while promoting good health engenders self-esteem and the self-nurturing behaviours
    that promote physical and psychological well-being. I despair at our hysteria
    about obesity and bullying, and our refusal to connect the two. For instance,
    obese kids are more likely than their thin classmates to be bullied.\r\n\r\nI
    agree that our bodies belong to us, as does the right to prune, pierce, modify,
    sculpt and even abuse them - despite religious scolding or contrary expert advice.
    And yes, it is as wrong for society to stereotype fat people as lazy, gluttonous,
    smelly or lacking in self-control as it is to accord me the privilege of walking
    in public with my partner without anyone doing a double-take because I'm thin.\r\n\r\nBut
    I'm also a stickler for facts. While it's true - and poorly understood - that
    being overweight actually reduces one's risk of dying from any cause, it is also
    the case that being obese or underweight are risk factors for mortality. This
    undercuts the accuracy of the ''health at any size'' message, though I agree that
    for pragmatic reasons (its esteem-enhancing thrust, the proven ineffectiveness
    of dieting for most) it offers the most promising approach.\r\n\r\nMore importantly,
    I think some fativists may need to think more critically about their own agenda
    and perhaps less critically about the good-hearted objectives of others.\r\n\r\nFor
    fat acceptance advocates, Freedman's tweet captures all that is wrong with society's
    attitude to body weight. Said one blogger: ''She wasn't making a feel-good statement
    about how we should accept and embrace the realities of our own bodies â\x80¦
    she was invoking â\x80¦ [our] obsessive fear of fat â\x80¦ [Such] tropes are also
    misogynistic, heteronormative, and promote able-bodied & white as beauty ideals.''\r\n\r\nIt
    is good that those objecting to our culture's equation of thin and beautiful also
    question why older, non-white, gay and disabled folk are excluded from the beauty
    standard. But the sincerity of such interrogation is undercut by fat acceptance
    articles illustrated with photos of heavily made-up obese women posing like models.
    Such illustrations don't seem to say ''no way'', but express the less radical
    sentiment of ''me too''.\r\n\r\nCelebrity adds much to the profile of any social
    change campaign but celebrities aren't perfect. Freedman takes her work as a body
    image activist seriously and has made headway. She deserves to be admired, or
    left alone."
