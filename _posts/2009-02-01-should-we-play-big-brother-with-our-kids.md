    children are concerned, the answer is clearly yes. Children\r\nlack the experience
    and wisdom to accurately judge their own best\r\ninterests. We donâ\x80\x99t make
    them accountable for their choices because of\r\nthis, even when they end in tragedy.

    their legal and moral\r\nrights to use one.\r\n\r\nTeenagers are different. The
    decision-making competency presumed in\r\nadults does not instantly spring into
    being when a child turns 16, 18 or\r\n21. Some 14 year olds may have sufficient
    understanding of relevant\r\nfacts, implications and consequences to decide most
    things for\r\nthemselves, while a handful of 21 year olds will lack the competency
    to\r\ndecide much without guidance.\r\n\r\nThis truth compels medicos to assess
    the competency of juveniles on a\r\ncase-by-case basis. To ask whether the juvenile
    before them has the\r\nmaturity to make the particular choice they face without
    parental\r\ninvolvement.\r\n\r\nThis suggests that parents should also consider
    in each instance whether\r\nfitting their teen with a locator device is wise.
    To ask every time\r\nwhether their teen has sufficient intelligence to decide
    for herself\r\nwhere she will go and when she will return, and can be trusted
    at her\r\nword.\r\n\r\nThe question of trust is at the heart of the dilemma posed
    by child\r\nlocator devices. One that pits short-term parental objectivesâ\x80\x94to
    keep\r\nchildren safe and in controlâ\x80\x94against long-term ones, like how
    to deliver\r\nthe world a morally responsible adult.\r\n\r\nOur moral development,
    like our physical development, proceeds in\r\npredictable stages roughly correlated
