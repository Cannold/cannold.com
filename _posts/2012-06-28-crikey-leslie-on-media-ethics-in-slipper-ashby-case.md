    media reporter Matthew Knott writes:\r\n\r\nThe Peter Slipper affair hasn't only
    raised awkward questions about what does and doesn't constitute s-xual harassment
    -- it's re-opened a debate almost as old as journalism itself: how close should
    reporters get to their sources in their bid to break a story?\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday,
    the Commonwealth lodged documents in court suggesting that News Limited had been
    involved in an elaborate plot to destroy Slipper's career. One four-word text
    allegedly sent by journalist Steve Lewis to Slipper's accuser James Ashby -- \"We
    will get him!\" -- has caused the most controversy.\r\n\r\nThat text was allegedly
    sent less than a fortnight before Lewis broke the Slipper story on Saturday, April
    21 in News Limited's tabloids. On the same day, Lewis wrote a comment piece saying:
    \"In the history of Australian political crises, the allegations filed in court
    against Peter Slipper are among the most serious ever raised -- and they rank
    as potentially deadly.\"\r\n\r\nOther texts tendered to the court also revealed
    that News helped to pay for Ashby's accommodation costs while he was preparing
    his s-xual harassment claim.\r\n\r\nHere, some background is useful. Lewis is
    one of the longest-serving -- and most well-liked -- members of the Canberra press
    gallery. He's not speaking publicly about his involvement in the Slipper affair
    because he may be summonsed to appear in court. He has been covering Slipper's
    taxpayer funded spending forensically for years -- long before Slipper defected
    from the Libs to become speaker. He's also the journalist who, after many dealings
    with Treasury mole Godwin Grech, broke the 2009 \"ute-gate\" story that turned
    out to be based on a phony email.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, Labor frontbencher Anthony
    Albanese told parliament the ute-gate affair \"showed that certain parts of the
    media were involved in the attempted sabotage of a democratically elected government\".\r\n\r\nAs
    for News Limited and Lewis' involvement in the Slipper affair, he thundered: \"It
    is very clear that we need to draw a distinction and that people in the media
    need to recognise whether they are reporters or participants, observers or activists.
    There is an important distinction between the two that has to be upheld for the
    sake of the integrity of the media.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking on the ABC's The Drum program
    that evening, 2UE radio host John Stanley was far more forgiving:\r\n\r\nStanley:
    \"As for saying we will get him, I think the thing here is you don't put these
    things on the record. These are conversations, over the years, I'm sure journalists
    have had when they're trying to get close to a contact or a source...\"\r\n\r\nAnnabel
    Crabb: \"So it's alright as long as you don't put it in writing?\"\r\n\r\nStanley:
    \"Yes, probably. You're saying we'll get him because you're trying to empathise
    with someone to get a story out of them. I'm not apologising for it because we
    may hear more and we're obviously going to have to hear more about how this is
    planned.\"\r\n\r\nDenis Muller, a former assistant editor at The Sydney Morning
    Herald and associate editor at The Age, tells Crikey the line between journalist
    and participant is often a fuzzy one. But he added: \"This is participation in
    what is alleged to have been a political conspiracy to wrongly unseat a member
    of parliament.\r\n\r\n\"We all engage in some form of social ingratiation to win
    people over. Of course we want to win people's trust â\x80\x93 the important thing
    is that we do it with integrity.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lewis text, he says, \"looks terrible
    because it is terrible\".\r\n\r\n\"First, there is the use of plural first person
    -- the 'we'. That indicates that he is making common cause with his informant;
    that he is taking sides. He goes on to 'get him' -- and that seems indicative
    of a desire to do harm. It appears that he is making covert common cause with
    Ashby to do harm to Slipper. Thereâ\x80\x99s no other way of interpreting it --
    unless Mr Lewis offers another explanation,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMuller, now a professor
    at Melbourne University's Centre for Adanced Journalism, says the Lewis text appears
    to clash with several clauses in the MEAA code of ethics including: \"Use fair,
    honest and responsible means to obtain material\"; \"Do not suppress relevant
    available facts\"; and \"Disclose conflicts of interest that affect, or could
    be seen to affect, the accuracy, fairness or independence of your journalism\".\r\n\r\nMuller
    says that exposing allegations of s-xual assault against an MP is undoubtedly
    in the public interest, but the proper administration of justice is equally as
    important. There was also little public interest, he says, in the public learning
    about the Slipper allegations before the case appeared in court.\r\n\r\n\"I canâ\x80\x99t
    see any case for the public interest being served here. If anything itâ\x80\x99s
    being harmed,\" he said.\r\n\r\nEthicist and media commentator Leslie Cannold
    says the reporting of the Slipper affair threatens to further undermine the public's
    trust in journalism.\r\n\r\n\"It's in the public interest to know about things
    happening in the political sphere but the journalist has failed to disclose the
    political machinations behind this,\" she told Crikey. \"He hasn't given us the
    full story ... It's part of a journalist's job to make judgments about why people
    are leaking, whether they're being used and whether the story is in the public
    interest.\r\n\r\n\"If journalists are campaigning for the underdog -- people without
    the power or authority to have their story told -- then there's no reason to be
    concerned about that. But it's very different if a journalist is colluding with
    the powerful to achieve a political outcome. The two could not be more different.\"\r\n\r\nBill
    Birnbauer, a former investigative reporter at The Age, says although journalists
    should aim for \"professional detachment\" from their sources this is difficult
    to achieve in reality.\r\n\r\n\"Journalists frequently empathise or identify with
    their sources in order to get information in a way that makes sources believe
    they are on their side ... 'We will get him' is fairly out there but journalists,
    all the time, give the impression that theyâ\x80\x99re onside with people.\"\r\n\r\nBirnbauer,
    now a professor of journalism at Monash University, adds that although journalists
    often ingratiate themselves with sources, this does not mean those sources are
    always happy with the end result: \"At the end of the day: the question has to
    be: is the story in the public interest? Are you getting close to a source so
    that the public learns about something important or so they talk to you rather
    than someone else?\"\r\n\r\nFormer Fairfax political correspondent Kerry-Anne
    Walsh, who spent 25 years in the Canberra press gallery, says she won't make judgments
    on Lewis's reporting until she hears his side of the story.\r\n\r\n\"There is
    clearly a public interest in knowing about Peter Slipper's expenses and any allegations
    against him -- that definitely warrants scrutiny. But so does the subterranean
    warfare that started as soon as he was dragged into the speaker's chair,\" she
    said. I was in Parliament that day and it was clear from day one that the LNP
    were out to get him.\"\r\n\r\nShe says press gallery journalists are under more
    pressure from their bosses than ever before to score scoops. \"There is a fierce
    competition to get a story and it's not always healthy. You've got to show to
    your proprietor that you are value for money,\" she said.\r\n\r\nIn the federal
    court yesterday, Slipper's counsel David Chin agreed to give Lewis until July
    6 to comply with a subpoena to produce all text messages, documents, phone records,
    emails and memos sent between him and Ashby between February and April 2012.\r\n\r\nLewis
    and Campbell Reid, News Limited's editorial director, declined to comment to Crikey."
