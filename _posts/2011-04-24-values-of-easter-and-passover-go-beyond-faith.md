  content: "Passover and Easter are upon us. While the precise timing of each festival
    is dictated by different calendars (Passover the lunar one and Easter by the[
    Gregorian one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar)) both commemorate
    emerging values in an ancient world. Values like liberty and equality that are
    also hallmarks of secular ethical frameworks in the contemporary western world.\r\n\r\nI
    grew up knowing little about Passover. When my great-grandfather was still alive,
    my largely secular Jewish family celebrated it in a \"two-four-six-eight-dig-in-don't-wait\"
    manner. When he died, we barely marked it at all.\r\n\r\nI didn't know much about
    Easter either, other than that it involved my best friend getting seriously frocked
    up for her weekly foray to Church.\r\n\r\nI am not a believer. Over the years,
    I have come to think of faith as a harpsicord string embedded deep in an individual's
    makeup. Those who have it seek out services or rituals that strum this chord and
    awaken music in their hearts. Because I lack what has come to be known as the
    religious gene, spirituality and the ritual tied to it leave me cold.\r\n\r\nBut
    the history of religion does not. In the same way as those who forget the secular
    past are condemned to repeat it, those who lose sight of the ancient predicaments
    that shaped religious figures and stories still revered today will lack insight
    into the transformative power and unifying potential these narratives - properly
    understood - could have for believers and non-believers today.\r\n\r\nPassover
    celebrates the exodus of the Jews from bondage in Egypt to freedom in the Promised
    Land of Israel. Jesus of Nazareth (or Joshua as he almost certainly would have
    been called) was participating in the ritual meal - or Seder â\x80\x93 Jews are
    currently enacting across the world on one of the last nights of his life.\r\n\r\nFreedom
    was not just a historical preoccupation for the Jews at the time of Jesus, but
    a live one. Having endured 600 years of military conquest and colonisation, interrupted
    only for what were then viewed as the halcyon days of Jewish rule under King David
    and his son Solomon, Jews were casting about for a solution to the predicament
    of their colonial subjection and the oppression of an ill-educated and indigent
    majority by a corrupt religious caste that was selling salvation.\r\n\r\nWe use
    the term outcast today, but have little idea what it meant in Israelite society
    over 2,000 years ago. Back then, Israelites saw the collective condition of their
    tribe and each individual's plight as evidence of God's regard.\r\n\r\nTo have
    been born crippled, or struck down by illness, to come in contact with the skins
    of unkosher animals or - most seriously - to have contact with the dead, made
    one ritually unclean and so distant from God. This spiritual distance drew a matching
    response in the human world. That response was casting out.\r\n\r\nTo return to
    the fold, the cast-out soul must show contrition though rituals or sacrificial
    offerings at the Jewish Temple. Where more visible afflictions like club foot,
    leprosy or schizophrenia were involved, God's acceptance of such penance must
    be proved by the penitent's return to health.\r\n\r\nWomen were considered permanently
    beyond God's direct concern, though they could be seen indirectly through their
    connections to an upright man: a father, brother or son.\r\n\r\nIt is against
    this social reality that we must understand the desperate desire of biblical women
    to avoid divorce and to give birth to sons, who were their only means to God's
    grace and through it, survival and status in the human community.\r\n\r\nJoshua
    of Nazareth was challenging the spiritual status quo of such a world by claiming
    he had the same power as the Temple Priests to forgive - or heal - those cast
    out, and return them to the human community.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the Temple
    priests, he did this free of charge and for no more than a promise the penitent
    would not sin again. This was a direct challenge to the power and pockets of the
    elite priestly caste and predictably made waves.\r\n\r\nIt appears to have led,
    once the Romans were called in to aid their elite Jewish allies, to his ignominious
    and painful death.\r\n\r\nCould it be that Joshua was standing up for the full
    humanity not just of fisherman, tanners, cripples and lepers - but of women, too?
    Certainly, a consistent application of his ideas about the universality of God's
    concern would have seen women among the cast-outs needing redemption.\r\n\r\nBut,
    sadly, western intellectual history is littered with men convinced of the universality
    of rights for men of all races, religions and means, but unconvinced of the full
    humanity of women. We do know that the tenuous social and financial status of
    women was increasingly being recognised by Israelites of the time.\r\n\r\nThe
    Jewish scholar and royal Simon Bar Shetah, who died around 40 years before Joshua
    was born, sought to alleviate the plight of widows and divorcees though the innovation
    called the Ketubah, a marriage contract that required the payment of considerable
    sums of money to widows and the wives men chose to divorce.\r\n\r\nThe Gospel
    of Thomas also has Joshua asserting the full spiritual and human status of any
    woman who â\x80\x9Cmakes herself male,â\x80\x9D a notion that offends contemporary
    feminist standards but would have been radical for the time.\r\n\r\nThomas has
    Joshua making the claim in reply to Peter, who appears jealous of someone named
    Mary, a woman some believe may have been a fellow disciple who was eventually
    struck from the text, or mischaracterised in it as a whore.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost
    certain that Joshua did not foresee his brutal murder by the Romans. While we
    can thank Paul of Tarsus for much of the theological adaptations that centred
    religious attention on Joshua's death rather than the provocative wisdom that
    characterised his life, such focus may also be an artifact of the society in which
    Joshua lived.\r\n\r\nIn the same way as the Jews at the time of Jesus saw illness
    as a punishment from God, they understood death to be a judgment, too.\r\n\r\nMany
    men were vying for the title of Messiah at the time, which for them meant anything
    from a warrior to a prophet sent by God to rescue the Jewish people from the spiritual
    desecration and physical seizure of their land.\r\n\r\nJewish heroes and saviours,
    like Methuselah, lived forever. They did not suffer humiliating and torturous
    deaths at the hands of their enemies: stripped naked and strung up for viewing
    as they suffocated slowly beneath a relentless Mediterranean sun.\r\n\r\nIt seems
    possible that those who claimed Joshua did not really die - that God healed and
    resurrected him - saw this assertion as necessary to salvage his legacy and further
    their claim that he was the Messiah.\r\n\r\nBut were the ancients claiming that
    Joshua actually rose from the dead, or was their assertion symbolic - akin to
    the symbolic resurrections Joshua would have undertaken during his life?\r\n\r\nWhen
    Joshua forgives Lazarus, was he really re-enlivening a corpse, or was he offering
    healing to the most unclean of Israelites: the dead? If so, the message would
    have been dangerous and strong, for if Joshua could forgive a dead man, then any
    Israelite could offer and achieve redemption.\r\n\r\nShould he live to tell the
    tale of this social and spiritual rebellion he would be understood, in the logic
    of the times, to have the approval of God for the message of radical equality
    he was trying to send. So he had to die.\r\n\r\nTo be cast out in the time of
    Jesus was a form of oppression akin to slavery, the loss of one's standing as
    a full human being in society and the brutal subjugation by the powerful that
    follows it.\r\n\r\nThe world that Joshua described, where all people - believing
    they are loved equally by God - accept one another as equals, would indeed have
    been heaven on earth. Sadly, we still have yet to enter this state of grace.\r\n\r\nBut
    as Jews and Christians begin the holiday season they might well recall the shared
    history that shapes their celebrations, and the values of liberty and equality
    cherished by all.\r\n"
