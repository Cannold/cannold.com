  content: "The western obsession with rights makes it difficult to see their limitations.
    We speak about rights as if they were the only moral value with meaning, ignoring
    other important moral values like responsibilities or duties. In fact, responsibilities
    are the counterparts to rights â\x80\x93 you canâ\x80\x99t have one without the
    other.\r\n\r\nPhilosopher Carl Cohen writes that, â\x80\x9CIf animals have any
    rights, they must have the right not to be killed to advance the interest of others.â\x80\x9D
    Another way of putting this is that those who assert the rights of animals are
    in effect asserting â\x80\x93 first and foremost â\x80\x93 a right to life for
    all animals.\r\n\r\nBut for an animal to realise its right to life, farmers, hunters
    and researchers must collectively accept a duty not to kill them. Similarly, citizens,
    consumers and patients must refuse to eat, wear or use food, clothes and medicine
    that require an animal to die.\r\n\r\nAs Iâ\x80\x99ll be arguing in the IQ2 debate
    â\x80\x9CAnimal rights should trump human interestsâ\x80\x9D in Sydney on Tuesday
    night, the assertion of an animal right to life is non-sensical. It would require
    us â\x80\x93 just as one example â\x80\x93 to stop animals from hunting one another,
    just like we stop humans from killing one another. But more importantly, it is
    unnecessary to achieve what is required to improve the lot of animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs
    being vegan the most ethical way to live?\r\n Read more\r\nEven Peter Singer,
    one of the intellectual fathers of the animal rights movement, doesnâ\x80\x99t
    believe animals have a right to life. In his seminal text Animal Liberation he
    says we must refuse to contribute to â\x80\x93 and act to stop â\x80\x93 the unnecessary
    suffering of animals.\r\n\r\nBut he does not contend that animals have a right
    to life or that they suffer by having their life taken from them.\r\n\r\nInstead,
    what he claims is that intensively farmed animals suffer because of the cruel
    and tortuous ways they are made to live and are slaughtered. We have a duty to
    do what we can to stop this by boycotting businesses that treat animals cruelly.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nHaving
    done that, we have a choice. We can go without wearing make-up and without eating
    or wearing animal flesh that required the torture of animals, or we can source
    and buy cruelty-free cosmetics and eat and wear ethically-farmed and slaughtered
    animal products.\r\n\r\nIn other words, while it might have been true that when
    Animal Liberation was written in the 1970s, the result of a boycott was a vegetarian
    or vegan lifestyle, this is no longer the case. Today, there is more than one
    way to fulfil our obligations to eliminate the unnecessary suffering of animals.\r\n\r\nIndeed,
    given clear, cross-cultural evidence that only around 1.5% of people are willing
    to try or stick with a vegan or vegetarian lifestyle â\x80\x93 figures that have
    not changed over time â\x80\x93 the promotion of an ethically carnivorous life
    is likely to be a far more effective way to reduce the suffering of animals.\r\n\r\nTo
    me, this is so obvious that I have to ask why in 2016 animal rights groups continue
    to advance vegetarian and veganism as the only legitimate way to end animal suffering.
    A 2014 study funded by Voiceless, found that 70% of Australians agreed that â\x80\x9Chuman
    beings have an obligation to avoid harming all animalsâ\x80\x9D. This sort of
    sentiment had led â\x80\x9Csubstantial proportionsâ\x80\x9D to buy â\x80\x9Cfree
    rangeâ\x80\x9D meat and dairy and cruelty-free products. Despite this, the Humane
    Research Council â\x80\x93 authors of the study â\x80\x93 advised animal rights
    advocates that while they ought capitalise on â\x80\x9Cwidespread support for
    incremental improvementsâ\x80\x9D they must also continue to press people to â\x80\x9Cabstain
    from animal products entirely.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nWhy not press people who have chosen
    to make a difference through buying cruelty-free products to buy more of them
    more often? Or to buy them exclusively? Is it possible that vegetarianism and
    veganism continues to be promoted as the sole way of meeting our obligations to
    animals not because it is, but because it makes the promoters feel morally superior?\r\n\r\nIf
    it were, it wouldnâ\x80\x99t be the first time the eco-left stymied mass behaviour
    change with unpalatable prescriptions delivered in self-righteous tones.\r\n\r\n
    Being a little bit vegan is completely oxymoronic\r\nJill Wooster\r\n Read more\r\nAnalysis
    has revealed that mass communications around climate change provoked feelings
    of powerlessness rather than a desire to act in many people. Often the wrong moral
    note was struck, too. Environmental activist and philosopher Sarah Bachelard wrote
    at the time, â\x80\x9CThere can be a tone of self-righteousness ... a kind of
    shrill moral indignation ... We know that we are on the side of the angels, and
    in our own way we can fail to do justice to the complex reality of most human
    action and motivation. We get something out of â\x80\x98being rightâ\x80\x99 ...
    (and) satisfaction from making those who do not agree with us wrong.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThe
    truth is that an ethically carnivorous life is possible so long as we ensure the
    animals we consume have lived and died without unnecessary suffering.\r\n\r\nDo
    animal rights trump human interests? Not if the animal right we are talking about
    is a right to life, and the human interest at stake is health. But I join with
    most people in believing we do have an obligation to stop animal cruelty and to
    fulfill this duty through the choices we make about what we eat, wear and do every
    day."
