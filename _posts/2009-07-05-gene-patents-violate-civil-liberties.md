    whether\r\nprivate, for-profit companies should be allowed to gain exclusive\r\ncontrol
    over knowledge about our genes.\r\n\r\nShould private interests profit from their
    understanding of the human\r\ngenetic code or from tests or cures they may - or
    may not - be willing\r\nor are able to derive from this knowledge? Is such control,
    encouraged\r\nby research funding arrangements and facilitated by patent law,
    the best\r\nway to serve the public good and public health?\r\n\r\nThe American
    Civil Liberties Union says â\x80\x9Cnoâ\x80\x9D. Last month the union\r\nlaunched
    a court action on behalf of scientific and womenâ\x80\x99s health\r\ngroups and
    individual women at increased risk of hereditary cancers. The\r\naction challenges
    the patents on two genes held by a company called\r\nMyriad. The genes are linked
    to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and\r\nthe patent grants Myriad exclusive
    rights to control and profit from the\r\ntesting of women with a family history
    of such cancer, to conduct\r\nfurther research on the gene and to control and
    profit from therapies\r\nthat might result from the research.\r\n\r\nIf the union
    wins, itâ\x80\x99s not just the patent on Myriadâ\x80\x99s genes that may\r\nbe
    rendered invalid but the tens of thousands of other patents on human\r\ngenes,
    too.\r\n\r\nLuigi Palombi, a patent lawyer recently interviewed on the ABCâ\x80\x99s\r\nBackground
    Briefing, thinks this is fair enough. According to Palombi,\r\nprivate companies
    should never have been allowed to patent genes in the\r\nfirst place. Not only
    are such patents unfair (Myriad only identified\r\nfragments, but was granted
    control of the entire gene), but they violate\r\nthe legal prohibition on patenting
    abstract ideas or the laws and\r\nproducts of nature. Patents are ineffective
    and inefficient, reducing\r\nthe competition and co-operative endeavour needed
    to understand and\r\nexploit genes for human health and limiting womenâ\x80\x99s
    options regarding\r\ntheir medical care. Palombi says that instead of complaining
    about the\r\npotential loss of their genomic patents, the companies that currently\r\nhold
    patents should be grateful. They always knew they were stretching\r\nthe limits
    of patent law, and the fact that theyâ\x80\x99ve been getting away\r\nwith it
    for 20 years means â\x80\x9Ctheyâ\x80\x99ve received an advantage that, frankly,\r\nthey
    were not entitled to receiveâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, the Australian Law Reform
    Commission completed an 18-month\r\ninquiry into intellectual property rights
    over genetic materials and\r\nrelated technologies, though its recommendations
    have yet to be\r\nimplemented. The Senate community affairs committee just finished
    taking\r\nsubmissions on the wisdom of granting patents in Australia over genes\r\nand
    their products, with public hearings to commence shortly.\r\n\r\nThe main problem
    for those hoping to wrest control of the human genome\r\nfrom the profit-seekers
    is to counter the self-interested claim by\r\nbiotechs and big pharmaceutical
    companies that they are the only ones\r\nwho can do the research and development
    needed to unearth the secrets of\r\nthe genome. Such companies argue that in exchange
    for their contribution\r\nto human health, we owe them proprietary control and
    profits.\r\n\r\nThis is unadulterated rubbish. Patenting is just one component
    of a\r\nframework for facilitating scientific and medical innovation.\r\n\r\nThe

    to promote and protect genetic knowledge and innovation. It is\r\nnot too late
