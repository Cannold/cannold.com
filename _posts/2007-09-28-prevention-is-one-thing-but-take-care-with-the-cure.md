  content: "Ingrates. Thatâ\x80\x99s the word that keeps coming to mind when the Canberra\r\nlesbian
    case is raised. That, and some vital misapprehension of what\r\nparenting - at
    its core, and in its specifics - is all about.\r\n\r\nSadly, the fact that the
    parents involved happen to be lesbians has\r\nimpeded our capacity to get at the
    heart of what bothers us about this\r\ncase. And trust me, this is irrelevant.
    In the recent Australian past,\r\nother parents - a single straight woman from
    New South Wales, an older\r\nheterosexual couple from Queensland - have sought
    compensation in the\r\ncourts for medical negligence that resulted in a child
    being born where\r\nnone was wanted.\r\n\r\nCourts have traditionally frowned
    on compensating couples for children\r\nâ\x80\x9Cwrongly bornâ\x80\x9D because
    doctors failed to diagnose a pregnancy when\r\nabortion was still an option, or
    incompetently performed a\r\nsterilisation, or any other act of medical negligence
    resulting in the\r\nbirth of a healthy child where all reasonable attempts had
    been made to\r\navoid just this outcome. The reason was that they believed, and
    felt all\r\nof us out here in TV land should believe too, that the birth of a\r\nhealthy
    child is always a â\x80\x9Cgift from Godâ\x80\x9D or a â\x80\x9Cblessing.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nBut
    this is rubbish. Every time we use contraception or, when\r\ncontraception fails,
    seek abortion we frankly acknowledge that we donâ\x80\x99t\r\nwish to be â\x80\x9Cblessedâ\x80\x9D
    that way.\r\n\r\nAnd the truth is that if - as was the case for so long - gross
    medical\r\nnegligence resulting in the birth of a healthy child is consequence-free\r\nfor
    dodgy doctors, itâ\x80\x99s hard to see how theyâ\x80\x99ll not be more dodgy\r\ndoctors
    in the future. Not to mention the legitimate need some suing\r\nparents have for
    compensation monies to feed, cloth and educate a child\r\ntheyâ\x80\x99d not planned
    to have, and are missing out on educational and\r\nemployment opportunities to
    raise.\r\n\r\nYet such cases do leave a bad taste in the mouth. One reason is
    the\r\nimage most people canâ\x80\x99t help but get of the child involved - in
    some\r\ncases old enough to read the papers or listen to the news - discovering\r\nthat
    they had not been wanted, and the precise details of what their\r\nbirth had cost
    their parents in emotional, physical and monetary terms.\r\nThe fact that such
    children also have to cope with the fact that others\r\nknow they werenâ\x80\x99t
    wanted adds to the sense that parents who bring such\r\nsuits - through their
    betrayal of their childâ\x80\x99s trust and failure to\r\nprotect their child
    from hurt - fundamentally misunderstand what\r\nparenthood is about.\r\n\r\nWhich
    is, in my view, unconditional love. A number of years ago a\r\nchildless-by-choice
    colleague expressed amazement at peopleâ\x80\x99s\r\nwillingness to make commitments
    to live with, love and nurture for\r\nseveral decades a person they donâ\x80\x99t
    even know. To volunteer, in other\r\nwords, for the duties of parenthood.\r\n\r\nHe
    is right. Parental volunteerism is amazing, and points to what - when\r\nit is
    done well - is so morally admirable about those who raise children\r\nwell. From
    the first sighting of those double lines through the plastic\r\ntest window until
    the car with the tin cans and streamers drives away,\r\nthe experience of parenthood
    confounds expectations, preferences and\r\neven heartfelt desires. You wanted
    a natural birth but ended up with a\r\nC-section, hoped for a girl but got a boy,
    intended to breastfeed but\r\nended up bottle-feeding, wished for an athletic
    kid to take to the rugby\r\nbut wound up with a bookish one who preferred Scouts.\r\n\r\nThat
    your children sometimes disappoint, that the experience of\r\nparenting was not
    what you expected is par for the course and clearly\r\nspelled in the small print
    in the implied parental contract that\r\naccompanies each bundle of joy. The challenge
    is not just to accept the\r\nunpredictability of the experience, but to revel
    in it. To demonstrate\r\nthe virtues of good parenthood not just by having the
    grace to accept\r\nthe unexpected, but to make the best of it by showing a love
    devoid or\r\nstrings or reservations for your child each and everyday, whoever
    that\r\nchild turns out to be.\r\n\r\nDifficult? You betcha, but then nothing
    that brings joy, engenders\r\nself-respect and earns the admiration of others
    is easy. And done\r\nproperly, parenthood is one of the mot rewarding and respect-worthy\r\nundertakings
    in the world.\r\n\r\nPerhaps where the Canberra couples, and other parents who
    sue for\r\nchildren â\x80\x9Cwrongfully bornâ\x80\x9D fail is not knowing where
    to draw the line.\r\nYes, parenthood today is not what it was yesterday and most
    of us feel\r\nit is justified, even morally required, to exercise control where
    we can\r\nby contracepting, screening prenatally, choosing abortion. . To avoid
    or\r\nrefuse the hefty responsibilities of parenthood when we feel we canâ\x80\x99t\r\nmanage
    them and be the kind of parent we wish to be.\r\n\r\nBut at some point in the
    proceedings a line is crossed. The line beyond\r\nwhich control - responsible
    or otherwise - can no longer be exercised.\r\nWhere the only moral option is to
    quit kicking and accept the outcome -\r\nthe living, breathing, feeling, vulnerable
    outcome - with good grace and\r\nhand in hand, to step into the dark in search
    of light.\r\n\r\nTo say a child has been born. Let us rejoice."
