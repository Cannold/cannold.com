  content: "Victoriaâ\x80\x99s intellectuals are blind to the Premierâ\x80\x99s popular
    appeal.\r\nHereâ\x80\x99s why.\r\n\r\nROBERT Manne on this page on Monday (\\`\\`The
    state of silenceâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99)\r\nbemoaned the apathy of Victorians towards
    Jeff Kennettâ\x80\x99s undercutting of\r\ndemocracy. Such indifference, argued
    Manne, means Victorians must\r\nultimately bear responsibility for anti-democratic
    outcomes such as the\r\nsilencing of public servants, the nobbling of the director
    of public\r\nprosecutions and the auditor-general, and the demonising of\r\n\\`\\`qualityâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99
    media such as the ABC and The Age.\r\n\r\nManneâ\x80\x99s argument exemplifies
    the frustration of academic and\r\njournalistic intellectual elites - aka the
    chattering classes - at our\r\ninability to use our knowledge and reason to convince
    \\`\\`ordinaryâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\nVictorians to punish the Liberals at the ballot
    box tomorrow.\r\n\r\nHaving grown up in Reaganâ\x80\x99s America, this frustration
    has a familiar\r\nfeel for me. Like Victorian intellectuals today, American intellectuals\r\nback
    then were aghast at the anti-democratic policies and practices of\r\nthe Reagan
    administration. And, like their Victorian counterparts now,\r\nAmerican intellectuals
    then sought to persuade their countrymen that\r\nReaganâ\x80\x99s contempt for
    democracy merited his removal from office.\r\n\r\nBut more importantly, Americaâ\x80\x99s
    chattering classes refused either to\r\nacknowledge or to analyse - in public
    at least - the indifference of\r\nmost Americans to their knowledgeable and well-reasoned
    rejections of\r\nReaganâ\x80\x99s demagogic and populist leadership. Indeed, the
    most profound\r\nanalyses of Reaganâ\x80\x99s enduring popularity were that he
    was made of teflon\r\nand that the average person was incapable of understanding
    the\r\nimportance of the separation of powers to American democracy.\r\n\r\nLike
    Americaâ\x80\x99s elite in the 1980s, Victoriaâ\x80\x99s intelligentsia in the\r\n1990s
    have either ignored their inability to stop the rising tide of\r\nJeff-worship,
    or proffered condescending explanations of the publicâ\x80\x99s\r\nfailure to
    heed their warnings.\r\n\r\nWith so much ink having been used on the subject of
    why Victorians\r\nshould vote against Kennett, it may be appropriate to dedicate
    some\r\nspace to pondering the indifference of the vast majority of Victorians\r\nto
    this message.\r\n\r\nIn my view, this ineffectiveness stems from the inability
    of Victorian\r\nintellectuals to recognise and acknowledge that we - unlike most\r\nVictorians
    - are stakeholders in the processes essential to democracy.\r\nIntellectuals assume
    that public policy decisions are, and ought to be,\r\nknowledge-based, and that
    we will be the source of much of that\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nWe believe that democratic
    participation gives power to \\`\\`the peopleâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99\r\nto shape and
    share in the exercise of power. Most importantly, we\r\ninclude ourselves among
    \\`\\`the peopleâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 who not only have a\r\nresponsibility to participate,
    but whose participation is valued, and\r\nwill make a difference to the way things
    turn out.\r\n\r\nMany Victorians lack the sense of enfranchisement and empowerment
    that\r\nwe intellectuals presume. They donâ\x80\x99t expect to participate in
    decisions\r\nthat affect them, nor necessarily see the value in doing so. They
    would\r\nlike a fair go, but donâ\x80\x99t necessarily expect they will get one.\r\n\r\nIt
    may be that our assumptions about the nature of power and our\r\nrelation to it
    are learnt early. When I am treated unjustly, I rant\r\nabout ringing the ombudsman,
    or bang out indignant letters of complaint\r\nto my local member. My husbandâ\x80\x99s
    upbringing was less privileged than\r\nmine. He watches these energetic bouts
    with a wry smile and asks,\r\n\\`\\`Why donâ\x80\x99t you save yourself the trouble
    and just bend over and take\r\nit?â\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\n\r\nI see my efforts as
    meaningful and necessary gyrations in the search for\r\na justice I deserve and
    that can be achieved. He sees them as silly\r\nram-like batterings at a system
    that owes me nothing, and will see me\r\nwhere it wants me in the end. For him,
    the only realistic approach to\r\npower is to placate its hunger, and by so doing,
    avoid the worst of its\r\nwrath.\r\n\r\nThis attitude to power explains the Victorian
    publicâ\x80\x99s love affair with\r\nour despotic Premier, and their antagonism
    to the nationâ\x80\x99s intellectual\r\nelites.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of \\`\\`ordinaryâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99
    Victorians, Kennettâ\x80\x99s more realistic\r\nunderstanding of the realities
    of power puts them on an equal footing\r\nwith intellectual elites. The Premierâ\x80\x99s
    intuitive - rather than\r\nknowledge-driven - style of decision-making strips
    the intelligentsia of\r\ntheir privileged access to the Kingdomâ\x80\x99s decision-makers.
    His disdain\r\nfor the dogged pursuit of power and influence by special interestgroups\r\nsees
    him cut through the red tape of the process-lovers, to get on with\r\nthe business
    of governing for the majority.\r\n\r\nKennett has power and he is on the side
    of \\`\\`ordinaryâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99 Victorians.\r\nFor many Victorians, cultivating
    the favor of powerful friends is the\r\nbest - indeed the only - way to avoid
    \\`\\`bending overâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nLike the Premier, many Victorians
    see the pursuit by media organisations\r\nsuch as the ABC and The Age of honest
    and accountable government, as\r\nstupid and irrelevant. Far from seeing their
    interests served by\r\nhighbrow reporters on the trail of the truth, many Victorians
    seem to\r\nconcur with Kennettâ\x80\x99s assessment of such scrutiny as the nitpicking\r\nobsession
    of pedants with little grasp of the concerns of \\`\\`ordinaryâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\nVictorians.\r\n\r\nIf
    we are to fathom why the majority tomorrow will fail to heed our\r\ncalls to protest
    against the upending of democracy in Victoria, we\r\nintellectuals need to take
    a hard look at ourselves. We must acknowledge\r\nhow our alignment with power
    shapes our assumptions about, and valuing\r\nof, democracy, and how those with
    a different understanding of how power\r\noperates, and a less robust sense of
    personal entitlement, have come to\r\nsee us - not Kennett - as the enemy."
