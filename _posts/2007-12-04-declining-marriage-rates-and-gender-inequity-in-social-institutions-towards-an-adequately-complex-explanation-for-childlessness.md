    explanations\r\nfor Australiaâ\x80\x99s below-replacement fertility against each

    women were best understood as those who were Childless by\r\nChoice and those
    who were Childless by Circumstance. On the basis of\r\ntheir baseline orientation
    to motherhood - namely, the place, durability\r\nand stability of motherhood in
    their imagined futures and identities -\r\nthe latter group was categorised as
    either â\x80\x98Thwarted Mothersâ\x80\x99 or\r\nâ\x80\x98Waiters and Watchersâ\x80\x99.
    While the applicability of the findings are\r\nlimited because of the small, self-selected
    sample, the data shed some\r\nlight on the relative contributions of gender inequity
    and declining\r\npartnering rates to childlessness, and thus on the dispute between\r\nMcDonald
