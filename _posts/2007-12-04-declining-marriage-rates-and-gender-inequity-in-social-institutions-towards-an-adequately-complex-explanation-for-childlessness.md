title: 'Declining Marriage Rates and Gender Inequity in Social Institutions: Towards
  an Adequately Complex Explanation for Childlessness'
---
A recent newspaper report pitted McDonald’s and Birrell’s explanations
for Australia’s below-replacement fertility against each other. In this
article, Cannold presents data from qualitative research into the
experience and understandings of 35 childless women aged 28 to 42.

Childless women were best understood as those who were Childless by
Choice and those who were Childless by Circumstance. On the basis of
their baseline orientation to motherhood - namely, the place, durability
and stability of motherhood in their imagined futures and identities -
the latter group was categorised as either ‘Thwarted Mothers’ or
‘Waiters and Watchers’. While the applicability of the findings are
limited because of the small, self-selected sample, the data shed some
light on the relative contributions of gender inequity and declining
partnering rates to childlessness, and thus on the dispute between
McDonald and Birrell.
