    anybody listened to what Lisa Meldrum is - and is not - saying about\r\nher decision
    to pursue sole motherhood using donor sperm? She notes:\r\n\\`\\`All young girls
    dream of a husband, a house and a family, but itâ\x80\x99s\r\njust not the way
    it is for everybody and it wasnâ\x80\x99t that way for me. And\r\nthis is what
    it has come to.â\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\n\r\nMeldrum is not alone. Research suggests
    that while most women who expect\r\nto mother but wind up childless come to accept
    and enjoy life without\r\nchildren, a small number are unable to relinquish their
    dream of\r\nmotherhood. In my study of circumstantially childless women, this
    small\r\ngroup wants \\`\\`the whole packageâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99: marriage and motherhood.
    But,\r\nhaving failed to find a partner, or one willing to have children, these\r\nwomen
    despair of giving up their dream of motherhood too.\r\n\r\nSuch women have thought
    long and hard about whether they can be\r\n\\`\\`goodâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 mothers
    raising a child alone. Theyâ\x80\x99ve considered male role\r\nmodels and time
    and financial management issues. Theyâ\x80\x99ve anguished over\r\nthe sort of
    relationship they feel is important for their child to have\r\nwith their biological
    father, and how to provide it.\r\n\r\nSeveral women I know ultimately decided
    against sole motherhood because\r\nthey wanted their child to have a relationship
    with the biological\r\nfather, and couldnâ\x80\x99t find a man willing to donate
    sperm, or to do so\r\nwith a willingness to have a continuing relationship with
    the child.\r\nWomen who push ahead with their plans to mother do so because they\r\nbelieve
    they have found good solutions to what they accept are vital\r\nissues facing
    mothers and children born from donor sperm.\r\n\r\nWhile the controversy has been
    depicted as a battle of rights, \\`\\`moral\r\npanicâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 would be
    a far more accurate description. At the core of our\r\nanxiety is the growing
    social and economic autonomy of women, and the\r\ndeclining role of men in the
    formation of families.\r\n\r\nEarlier this week a conservative commentator lambasted
    Meldrum and other\r\nsingle women for the \\`\\`me, meâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 nature
    of their desire to mother. The\r\ncharge is that womenâ\x80\x99s new control of
    sometimes considerable resources\r\nhas turned them from their rightful 1950s
    role as promoters of the\r\ninterests and desires of others: men and children.\r\n\r\nAt
    the heart of this panic is the subconscious realisation that it has\r\nalways
    been womenâ\x80\x99s economic dependency - not their naturally selfless\r\nnatures
    - that led them to accept social roles that relegated them to\r\nbeing means to
    other peopleâ\x80\x99s ends.\r\n\r\nEven more anxiety-producing is the (mistaken)
    belief that what Meldrum\r\nwas asserting in her court action - and what the court
    was affirming in\r\nits decision - was that men are unnecessary in the important
    business of\r\nforming families. The worry is that womenâ\x80\x99s economic independence
    and\r\nadvances in reproductive technologies have led increasing numbers of\r\nwomen
    to conclude that men (as people, not sperm donors) are incidental\r\nto the having
    and raising of kids.\r\n\r\nBut while the evidence clearly shows that most women
    want men to be real\r\nplayers in the family, it also suggests a gap between what
    women expect\r\nfrom male partners, and what men are willing and able to provide.\r\nBecause
    middle-class women no longer have to marry for money, they are\r\nincreasingly
    rejecting men unable or unwilling to provide them with\r\nemotional companionship
    and to share the domestic load. There is growing\r\nevidence that increasing numbers
    of men would prefer a new car to a new\r\nbaby, and up to one-third may be reluctant
    or unwilling to undertake the\r\ncommitments of a stable relationship, little
    less those of fatherhood.\r\n\r\nWhat all this suggests is that as women have
    become choosier about their\r\nlife partners, fewer men are even putting their
    hands up for the job.\r\n\r\nThis tension - between what women want and what men
    can and want to\r\nprovide - is at the heart of the current debate. We must resist
    the\r\nCanberra-led charge to arrest our anxiety by taking pot shots at sole\r\nmothers,
    and search instead for the more lasting calm that comes from\r\nfinding solutions
    to the right questions."
