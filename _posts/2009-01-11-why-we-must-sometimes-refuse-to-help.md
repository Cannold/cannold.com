  content: "A while back a reader-letâ\x80\x99s call her Sharon-contacted me for help.
    Her\r\nstory was confusing and hard to follow, so she directed me a website she\r\nhad
    set up to publicise her cause. She also sent me some documents,\r\nwhich I committed
    to read with the view, if I could possibly make it\r\nwork, of writing a column
    on her case. I wanted to help.\r\n\r\nBut this was not enough for Sharon. She
    wanted me to do more.\r\nEventually, after a hail of text messages, emails and
    phone calls, I\r\nsevered contact. Not only was I ill-equipped to manage her mental
    state,\r\nI could not provide the â\x80\x9Crescueâ\x80\x9D from said situation
    she seemed to\r\nexpect. Her response to my non-replies was blunt, with my name
    joining\r\nher website list of those whom she has asked for help but not received\r\nit.
    The list includes writers, domestic violence workers, academics and\r\nanyone
    who had made public comment condemning violence and advocating\r\nfor womenâ\x80\x99s
    rights.\r\n\r\nNot long after I got another email, this time from a bloke Iâ\x80\x99ll
    call\r\nBaz. Bazâ\x80\x99s complaint was much like Sharonâ\x80\x99s. It was not
    good enough for\r\nme to write about moral issues without backing up my views
    with action.\r\nWhat was I planning to do about the corrupt use of taxpayer funds
    by\r\nPeter Costello, the lack of separation between church and state in the\r\nconstitution
    and the refusal of our politicians to take climate change\r\nseriously? I had
    the potential to make a difference and to fail to do so\r\nmade me a fancy dancer,
    to use Bryce Courtenayâ\x80\x99s phrase. A hypocrite,\r\nand distraction to righteous
    men.\r\n\r\nWhat do we owe to others? What is reasonable for others to ask of
    us?\r\n\r\nI have been a columnist for over a decade and in that time have received\r\nhundreds
    of emails from readers. Some in furious agreement with my\r\nviews, some respectfully
    despairing over my wrong-headness, others doing\r\nso in more colourful ways.
    But until Sharon and Baz, I failed to\r\nappreciate the common-sense wisdom of
    nearly all of them-their implicit\r\nunderstanding of limits. Limits on what is
    reasonable to expect from\r\nsomeone youâ\x80\x99ve never met. Limits on the moral
    contribution any one\r\nperson can make to the greater good, given their obligations
    to the\r\nparticular others in their lives.\r\n\r\nSuch clarity is an achievement.
    Philosophers have long disagreed about\r\nwhether obligations to family mitigate
    our moral requirement to serve\r\nthe greater good.\r\n\r\nTraditionalists say,
    â\x80\x9Cno.â\x80\x9D The best-known articulation of this view was\r\nby William
    Godwin (Frankenstein author Mary Shelleyâ\x80\x99s father). Godwin\r\nsaid that
    if two people were trapped by fire in a house, we would be\r\nobligated to save
    the Archbishop before going after the chambermaid.\r\nThis was true even if the
    maid was oneâ\x80\x99s mother or wife, because the\r\nArchbishopâ\x80\x99s life
    was of greater value to the world.\r\n\r\nI disagree. Indeed, to follow the dictates
    of Godwin and philosophers\r\nlike him would result in a world without meaningful
    relationships. If I\r\nrefuse to go to my childâ\x80\x99s school play because
    the starving children in\r\nAfrica need me more, the very nature of the parent-child
    bond stops\r\nmaking sense.\\\r\nWe are not obligated to dedicate our moral efforts
    to the most worthy.\r\nOur primary obligations are to the people to whom we are
    bound by\r\npromise, affection or blood."
