    a scandal of his own making may not engage everyoneâ\x80\x99s sympathy and\r\ninterest.
    Tabloid-fodder, we might sniff, before returning to the more\r\nserious business
    of sipping lattes and cracking open expensive bottles\r\nof chardonnay.\r\n\r\nBut
    Huntâ\x80\x99s story (extra-marital sex with three women, hush-money paid,\r\nembarrassed
    wife standing by her man, yada-yada-yada) has engendered the\r\nsame debate that
    often accompanies media decisions to headline the\r\nmisadventures of the rich
    and famous. A debate about whether such\r\nstories are in the public interest,
    or simply of interest to the public.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to think that
    Huntâ\x80\x99s marital infidelity is whatâ\x80\x99s\r\ndrawn the attention of
    the press. Recent Australian history suggests\r\nthat it is not infidelity per
    se, but hypocrisy that often goads the\r\npress into running with a story. Infidelity
    is often the incident that\r\nexposes such double standards, but itâ\x80\x99s
    not the only one. Remember the\r\nhuff-and-puff photos of Shane Warne that gave
    lie to his claim that heâ\x80\x99d\r\nquit smoking?\r\n\r\nThe Kernot affair also
    shows the critical role hypocrisy plays in\r\njournalistsâ\x80\x99 decisions to
    take a story public. Cheryl Kernotâ\x80\x99s affair\r\nwith former Labor foreign
    minister Gareth Evans was well-known to the\r\nCanberra press gallery. Reporter
    Laurie Oakes only spilled the beans -\r\nand set the media frenzy in train - in
    the wake of Kernotâ\x80\x99s decision to\r\nexclude this information from her
    memoir. Free in apportioning fault to\r\neveryone else for her political downfall,
    Oakes objected to what he saw\r\nas the hypocritical omission of information that
    might have pointed at\r\nleast one of the fingers of blame in her direction.\r\n\r\nIt
    is said that every culture has prohibitions against hypocrisy. In all\r\nlikelihood,
    this is because hypocrisy can indicate significant\r\ncharacter-flaws like hubris,
    dishonesty and an inability to take\r\npersonal responsibility. While we probably
    wouldnâ\x80\x99t mind being notified\r\nabout the presence of such qualities in
    all those we deal with (Iâ\x80\x99d opt\r\nfor a Loganâ\x80\x99s Run-esque blinking
    palm light myself), we feel entitled -\r\nrightly I think - to get the skinny
    on such matters when it comes to\r\npublic figures.\r\n\r\nThis is because the
    stature of public figures like Hunt give them\r\nprivileges the rest of us donâ\x80\x99t
    enjoy. Small perks like the wielding of\r\npower to shape the world in which we
    live, either through the\r\nimplementation of policy, or the use of media platforms
    to influence\r\nhealth, fashion or lifestyle trends. When AFL footballers are
    condemned\r\nfor their shabby treatment of women, itâ\x80\x99s not just because
    such\r\nbehaviour - no matter who does it - merits our disapproval, but also\r\nbecause
    they arenâ\x80\x99t anyone. They are the blokes our kids, particularly\r\nboys
    aged 6 to 20, admire and seek to emulate. They speak and we listen.\r\nI mean,
    dâ\x80\x99oh! Thatâ\x80\x99s why our so many Fortune 500 companies are after\r\nthese
    fellas to promote their products.\r\n\r\nThis means two things. Firstly, that
    the public may be justified in\r\nexpecting a higher standard of behaviour from
    public than they do from\r\nJoe and Judy Blow. Some people might argue this is
    unfair. They did when\r\nWayne Carey was being pilloried for simultaneously doing
    the dirty on\r\nhis best friend and his own partner Sally by sleeping with Anthony\r\nStevensâ\x80\x99
    wife, Kelli. â\x80\x9CHeâ\x80\x99s an athlete,â\x80\x9D they cried. â\x80\x9CJust
    because a\r\nbloke can kick a football doesnâ\x80\x99t mean he was first in line
    when they\r\nhanded out basic human decency.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nPerhaps less controversial
    is the contention that public figures with\r\nthe stature to command column inches
    and television time - be they\r\npoliticians, radio shock-jocks, or entertainers
    - need to put up or shut\r\nup when it comes to how the rest of us live. If powerful
    people use\r\ntheir capacity to command an audience to outline their moral view
    about\r\nhow we should all run our marriages, manage our health or rationalise\r\nour
    citizenships, it seems only fair to expect them to practice what\r\nthey preach,
    or to suffer the pain of being outed as a hypocrite. It was\r\nformer Liberal
    politician Ross Cameronâ\x80\x99s choice to gallivant around his\r\nelectorate
    preaching family values, and plastering photos of his four\r\nchildren and smiling
    wife across his promotional materials. When he also\r\nchose not to keep his pants
    buttoned, the media was perfectly entitled -\r\nif not obliged - to let the public
    know.\r\n\r\nWith benefits come costs; with license comes responsibility. Should
    this\r\nresponsibility not be met, the public has a right to know. The\r\njudgements
    we make from there is up to us. We may shrug, and run the â\x80\x9Cto\r\nerr is
    humanâ\x80\x9D script in our head. We may decide our hero still deserves\r\nour
    worship or the politician our vote, or then again we might not.\r\n\r\nYes, public
    figures live in a fishbowl, but for most of them - and\r\ncertainly for Rex Hunt
    - thatâ\x80\x99s their choice. Other jobs with lower\r\nprofiles and salaries
    are available; oneâ\x80\x99s where the mismatch between\r\nwhat one says and does
    are more likely to be overlooked.\r\n\r\nThen too, thereâ\x80\x99s always the
    option of just keeping oneâ\x80\x99s one mouth\r\nshut."
