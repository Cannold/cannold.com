title: Centennial Warriors by Elizabeth Kehoe
---
In the wake of the passage of the Abortion Law Reform Bill here in Victoria late in 2008, Elizabeth Kehoe sent me this beautiful tribute.
  
I have included an image of it so you can see it formatted as she intended, the origninal PDF she sent me is [[centennial-warriors|link_text=attached]]. I have also included an inline version below to make it easier for the sight-imparied to access the text.

Thank you Elizabeth.

## Centennial Warriors
  
_(for Leslie Cannold)_
  
1908   
Magnanimous woman   
suffragette   
you fought long   
strong   
relentless   
often thwarted   
out of breath   
bleeding   
yet always believing   
you would succeed—   
one hundred years on   
we honour your achievement   
  
2008   
Magnanimous woman   
abortion-law reformist   
you fought long   
strong   
relentless   
often thwarted   
out of breath   
bleeding   
yet always believing   
you too would succeed—   
today and   
every tomorrow   
we honour   
your achievement
