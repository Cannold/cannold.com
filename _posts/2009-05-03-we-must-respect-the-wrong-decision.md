    a harder\r\none. When pregnant women do smoke, what should we do about it?\r\n\r\nThe
    reality is that 16 per cent of Australian women of childbearing age\r\nsmoked
    through their last pregnancy. Most would have less education and\r\na more working-class
    pedigree than women who have never smoked, or who\r\nquit when two lines appeared
    on their pregnancy test.\r\n\r\nPublic health experts find these women frustrating
    and work hard\r\nestablishing anti-smoking health messages that will convince
    them to\r\nquit.\r\n\r\nBecause research makes clear that smoking is toxic to
    both mother and\r\nbaby, some judge women who smoke while pregnant as bad mothers
    who, in\r\nthe words of medical participants at an anti-smoking seminar, should
    be\r\nhanged â\x80\x9Cfrom the nearest treeâ\x80\x9D for smoking.\r\n\r\nThe theory
    behind quit smoking campaigns and all public health messages\r\nis simple. That
    people only smoke or undertake other unhealthy\r\nactivities because they donâ\x80\x99t
    know the risks they are taking. Once they\r\ndo, they will stop and begin living
    right.\r\n\r\nIf only it were so simple. The truth is that we all do things we
    know\r\nare bad for our health. We eat rich food, drink too much grog, eschew\r\nexercise
    and have unprotected sex. Habit, peer pressure, rebellion and\r\ncynicism about
    the claimed cost of transgression are just some of the\r\nreasons we do what experts
    say we must not.\r\n\r\nWe also sometimes do the wrong thing by our bodies - have
    ice-cream\r\nrather than fruit or salad, stay up late when we need our sleep -\r\nbecause
    the certain and immediate pleasure overwhelms the possibility of\r\nfuture doom.\r\n\r\nSometimes,
    in other words, we make an informed and voluntary choice to\r\ndo the wrong thing.
    We know what we are doing is bad for us and we\r\ndecide to do it anyway.\r\n\r\nKeeping
    faith with the informed consent framework behind public health\r\ncampaigns means
    we must not only accept that this is the case, but that\r\nhowever ill-advised
    we think the decisions of others are, they are ones\r\nthat a person is entitled
    to make.\r\n\r\nOverzealous public health campaigners find this hard. In the United\r\nStates
    recently, their frustration with the refusal of their fellow\r\ncitizens to quit
    smoking led them to over-egg the evidence against\r\npassive smoking. When a long-time
    anti-smoking researcher, Michael\r\nSiegel, called them on it, they slurred his
    reputation and cut him off\r\nfrom information vital to his work.\r\n\r\nYet Siegelâ\x80\x99s
    point was inarguable - that the use of shoddy science in\r\nanti-smoking campaigns
    will backfire, leading people to distrust future\r\nhealth messages about the
    negative impact on health caused by smoking.\r\n\r\nWhich returns us to pregnant
    smokers. No one is arguing that that\r\nsmoking does not pose health risks to
    pregnant women and their\r\ndeveloping foetuses. It does and it is vitally important
    that pregnant\r\nwomen are offered hard scientific facts about the nature of those
    harms.\r\nShould they respond by choosing to quit, they should be offered every\r\npractical
    support available to succeed.\r\n\r\nBut where women decide to carry on smoking
    or to just cut back, this\r\ndecision must be respected. Distortion of the evidence
    to scaremonger is\r\nfoul play.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the decision of pregnant
    women to smoke must be\r\nunderstood as a health, not a moral, problem. After
    all, pregnant women\r\nare like all other smokers. People who, regrettably, but
    like all of us,\r\ndonâ\x80\x99t always do whatâ\x80\x99s best for their health."
