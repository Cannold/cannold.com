    is in the news again, and once more the terms of the debate are\r\nheavily weighted
    against women. As usual, the anti-choice movement is\r\ntrying to stir up anxiety
    about second-trimester abortions as a means of\r\ndepicting women as unethical
    foetal containers.\r\n\r\nThose immersed in the abortion debate have long recognised
    that\r\nundermining womenâ\x80\x99s moral agency, not upholding the rights of
    the\r\nfoetus, is the centrepiece of anti-choice strategy. Examples abound, but\r\nthe
    most obvious is the anti-choice attitude to abortion choices in the\r\nhard cases:
    when the pregnancy is life-endangering or the result of rape\r\nor incest. If
    the anti-choice movement really opposed abortion because\r\nit denies the foetus
    its right to life, then they would oppose all\r\nabortions - hard case or not
    - with equal determination. After all, how\r\nthe foetus is conceived has no bearing
    on its \\`\\`right to lifeâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nHowever, polls show that
    few anti-choicers outside the Popeâ\x80\x99s intimate\r\ncircle believe a women
    ought to be forced to sacrifice her life to bring\r\nher embryo to term, or to
    bring to term an embryo conceived through rape\r\nor incest.\r\n\r\nWhat the hard
    cases demonstrate is that what really lies behind\r\nanti-choice sentiment are
    mistaken views about the motives, intentions\r\nand feelings of women who choose
    abortion. Anti-choice rhetoric abounds\r\nwith caricatures of women who seek abortions:
    women who abort because of\r\ntheir careers or their desires to go on ski trips
    or get into bikinis.\r\nThe aim of the anti-choice movement is to convince the
    public to see\r\nabortion as proof that too many women hold all the wrong values
    about\r\nmotherhood, womanhood and material possessions. That women who choose\r\nabortion
    are, to use Fred Nileâ\x80\x99s shorthand, snarling hard-faced\r\npro-abortion
    feminists.\r\n\r\nThe fretting of anti-choicers about late-term abortions is part
    of this\r\nstrategy. So while anti-choice concern appears to be about the\r\nalmost-viable
    foetus, the strategy is really designed to demonstrate the\r\nincapacity of women
    to act as moral agents. What kind of a woman, they\r\nask, could care so little
    for her baby that she would choose to delay\r\nhaving a termination for so long?\r\n\r\nThe
    female, rather than foetal, target of anti-choice rhetoric is summed\r\nup well
    by anti-choice campaigner Margaret Tigheâ\x80\x99s wonderment about why\r\na woman
    seeking a second-trimester abortion doesnâ\x80\x99t just \\`\\`go on and\r\nallow
    [her] baby to be born - Iâ\x80\x99m sure the Mafia would be happy to kill\r\nit
    for a much cheaper rateâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nThe irony is that womenâ\x80\x99s
    intense concern for the wellbeing of their\r\nfoetus and others whom they love
    and to whom they feel responsible is\r\nbehind most decisions about unplanned
    pregnancies. Far from seeing\r\nherself as locked in an evolutionary and political
    conflict of interests\r\nwith her foetus, the woman sees herself as responsible
    for her foetus:\r\nits protector, and the only person who can make the best and
    most caring\r\ndecision about its fate.\r\n\r\nA woman doesnâ\x80\x99t see her
    abortion decision as ethically justified because\r\nher rights override those
    of her foetus. She deems it ethical only if\r\nshe has made a careful, responsible
    decision to forgo motherhood because\r\nshe does not believe herself capable of
    parenting in the way she feels\r\nis right. Many of the women in my study, for
    example, felt strongly that\r\nbefore they had children, they should be financial,
    have a partner and\r\nbe ready to take on the responsibilities of parenthood.\r\n\r\nJust
    5per cent of abortions in Australia take place after 12 weeksâ\x80\x99\r\ngestation.
    Half of these are done after 16 weeks, the vast majority for\r\ngrief-stricken
    women with tragic amnio or scan results.\r\n\r\nIf the anti-choice movement were
    really interested in reducing\r\nsecond-trimester rates, they would lobby to remove
    legislative\r\nimpediments to Australian women accessing RU486. Ten yearsâ\x80\x99
    experience\r\nin France has shown that when women gain access to the abortion
    pill,\r\nthe overall number of abortions remains steady, but more are had earlier\r\nin
    pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe anti-choice movement could also put its considerable funds
    into\r\nunearthing and providing all women with access to foetal diagnostic\r\ntools
    that are safe to use earlier in pregnancy, allowing women who\r\nterminate because
    of a heartbreaking diagnosis to do so sooner.\r\n\r\nAnd the movement could lobby
    for policies that would limit the abuse and\r\nignorance that lead women to delay.
    An English study recently concluded\r\nthat nearly all women seeking second-trimester
    terminations have severe\r\nsocial and psychological problems. Like the 12-year-old
    girl found to be\r\n26-weeks pregnant by her teacher. Her father in prison, her
    mother\r\npreoccupied with other children (she thought the girlâ\x80\x99s weight
    gain was\r\npuppy fat), the girl said she had been raped in the lift of her block
    of\r\nflats. It turned out the alleged rapist was sexually involved with the\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nBut,
    of course, the anti-choice movement has no intention of doing any\r\nof these
    things - because concern about the viability or rights of the\r\nfoetus is not
    really the cause of their anxiety about second-trimester\r\nabortions. Second-trimester
    abortions are simply the emotive fodder used\r\nto gain public support for the
    goal of prohibiting all women from\r\naccessing safe and legal abortions at any
    point.\r\n\r\nBehind calls for prohibition is the belief that women so lack moral\r\nagency
    that the state would be justified in stripping them of their\r\nreproductive rights,
    thereby forcing all who conceive to mother."
