    of an essay on scientific criticism by Sharon Gould. Gould\r\nis described as
    having a PhD in Applied Science (biotechnology) and\r\nbeing employed as a biotechnology
    informatics consultant.\r\n\r\nBut Gould is not a real person. Her essay, â\x80\x9CScare
    campaigns and science\r\nreporting,â\x80\x9D was a hoax, as Quadrant editor and
    cultural warrior Keith\r\nWindshuttle discovered to his dismay when the journalist
    who broke the\r\nstory, Margaret Simons, rang him for comment. According to Simons,
    the\r\nessay contained â\x80\x9Cfalse science, logical leaps, outrageous claims
    and a\r\nmixture of genuine and bogus footnotes,â\x80\x9D that Windshuttle should
    have\r\nspotted.\r\n\r\nSome journalists have treated the story with glee, setting
    off like\r\nhounds after Gouldâ\x80\x99s real identity. Windshuttleâ\x80\x99s
    nemesis, historian and\r\nformer Quadrant editor Robert Manne, was no less restrained.
    He told The\r\nAge that he had â\x80\x9Ctears rolling down [his] cheeksâ\x80\x9D
    while reading the\r\nbogus essay.\r\n\r\nI donâ\x80\x99t think we need to know
    Gouldâ\x80\x99s true identity or to laugh at the\r\nelegance of the sting, which
    was designed to humiliate Windshuttle, and\r\ncast doubt on the integrity of the
    conservative ideology he espouses. I\r\nthink we need to judge whether the hoax
    was fair. Or fair enough.\r\n\r\nThe use of shame and humiliation to discipline
    those who break the rules\r\nand flout the powerful has fallen out of fashion
    in recent years, but is\r\ncentral to hoaxes. The Ern Malley scam of the 1940s
    saw two traditional\r\npoets publish what they saw as slapdash pretentious rubbish
    in an\r\navant-garde literary journal. More recently, American physics Professor\r\nAlan
    Sokal exposed the acceptance of a paper â\x80\x9Cliberally salted with\r\nnonsenseâ\x80\x9D
    by editors of a cultural studies journal. Sokal claimed the\r\npublication of
    his article proved that some disciplines would accept\r\nanything as legitimate
    scholarship as long as it â\x80\x9Csounded goodâ\x80\x9D and\r\nâ\x80\x9Cflattered
    the editorsâ\x80\x99 ideological preconceptions.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nWhile embarrassment
    of individuals is the vehicle by which hoaxes take\r\neffect, this is not always
    the primary objective. Often, the main game\r\nis the slaying, through ridicule,
    of intellectual interlopers. Those\r\nartists or scholars who dare to challenge
    existing orthodoxies and, by\r\nso doing, threaten the power of those who promulgate
    them. Both Malley\r\nand Sokal fall into this category.\r\n\r\nBut the latest
    hoax offers something new. Instead of orthodox\r\npractitioners (traditional poets,
    scientists) holding their nascent\r\nchallengers (post-modernists, humanities
    academics) up for laughs, the\r\nWindshuttle affair sees the intellectual gatecrashers
    fighting back. As\r\nthe hoaxer explains it, the Gould essay â\x80\x9Cderidesâ\x80\x9D
    the â\x80\x9Cvery\r\nconstructivist argumentsâ\x80\x9D used in the climate-change
    denial articles\r\nregularly published in Quadrant. Indeed, itâ\x80\x99s hard
    not to feel that\r\ninsofar as the cultural left evinces exuberance about Windshuttleâ\x80\x99s\r\ndownfall,
    this flows from relief that, for once, they are not the ones\r\nbeing played as
    fools.\r\n\r\nBut here lies the crux of the issue; the very problem the hoax sought
    to\r\nlay bare. Either what was done to Windshuttle was fair, or it was not.\r\nAn
    article is either worthy of publication because it demonstrates\r\nadequate scholarship
    (logical precision, accuracy, evidential rigour),\r\nor it does not. If one is
    applying the standards of thought and judgment\r\nthat is the hallmark of the
    university-educated-and one might rightly\r\nexpect this of those who hold themselves
    out as guardians of academic\r\nstandards-then the direction of an argument should
    be neither here nor\r\nthere when its worth is assessed.\r\n\r\nIt is fair, I
    think, to hold Windshuttle to account for inconsistent\r\napplication of his exacting
    standards of scholarship. In particular, for\r\nonly checking the footnotes of
    those with whom he disagrees. Pillorying\r\nalso seems justified for his failure
    to uphold even the most basic\r\neditorial standards before putting â\x80\x9CGouldâ\x80\x9D
    into print. Like ensuring he\r\ncould substantiate Gouldâ\x80\x99s claimed academic
    credentials by locating her\r\non a university website, or finding a paper sheâ\x80\x99s
    written in any of the\r\nacademic databases easily accessible on the web.\r\n\r\nTo
    the question of whether the exposure of such double standards was\r\nimportant
    enough to sacrifice Windshuttleâ\x80\x99s reputation, I think the\r\nanswer is,
    â\x80\x9Cyes.â\x80\x9D Windshuttle is a public figure who made his name not\r\njust
    by challenging the accuracy of some footnotes in the work of\r\nhistorians like
    Henry Reynolds, but by suggesting their errors were part\r\nof a deliberate attempt
    to deceive Australians about the true facts of\r\nhistory. Such charges are extremely
    serious, going to the personal and\r\nprofessional integrity of these scholars.
    Scholars whose substantive\r\nviews about Australiaâ\x80\x99s early history he
    did not like. To be hoisted on\r\noneâ\x80\x99s own petard in such a case not
    only seems justified, but evidence\r\nof some sort of cosmic justice.\r\n\r\nWe
    value impartiality because there can be no fairness without it. We\r\nvalue reason
    because, when properly deployed, it should see all of us\r\narrive at the same
    conclusions about the nature of a problem, and its\r\npotential solutions. We
    value evidence because it provides a firm\r\nfoundation on which reason can proceed.
    We value these things not\r\nbecause they are easy, but because they are hard
    for us to achieve.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the culture wars was a conflict over
    different ways of\r\nknowing. Against the university-educated â\x80\x9Celites,â\x80\x9D
    trained to use\r\ncareful and critical discourse to make their point were those
    deploying\r\nmore traditional ways of asserting authority: fear, force, ridicule,\r\nexclusion.\r\n\r\nWhether
