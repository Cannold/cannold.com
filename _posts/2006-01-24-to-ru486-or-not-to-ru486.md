title: To RU486 or not to RU486?
---
In the next few weeks, the Australian parliament will debate a bill that
would let the Therapeutic Goods Association (TGA) decide on whether
RU486, the abortion pill, could be used in Australia. This has kick
started a pretty feisty debate and a strong letter campaign from those
who want to stop RU486 from being available in Australia in which Leslie
was involved.

talk about RU486 on the Hack program on ABC youth radio Triple J.
