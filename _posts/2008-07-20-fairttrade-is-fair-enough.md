    go\r\naway.\r\n\r\nAs most coffee-drinkers know, Fairtrade (and its new competitor\r\nRainforest
    Alliance) are dedicated to increasing the ethical footprint\r\nof western consumers
    by encouraging them to buy products that offer a\r\nbetter deal to those in the
    developing world who make them. In essence,\r\nfair trade schemes ask us to pay
    more for things we are told have been\r\nfarmed in a sustainable way by workers
    protected by International Labor\r\nOrganisation conventions.\r\n\r\nImplicit
    in the very project of ethical consumerism is a critique of the\r\nway we currently
    do business when it comes to global trade, and the\r\nvalues that underlie the
    free trade ideal.\r\n\r\nNo wonder Tim Wilson, from the free market Institute
    of Public Affairs,\r\nis pursed lipped. In an interview on ABC Radio Nationalâ\x80\x99s
    Background\r\nBriefing Wilson claimed to be worried that consumers buying fair
    trade\r\nproducts were being [duped]() â\x80\x9CDeveloped country consumers are
    buying\r\nthese products with the expectation that the right thing is being done\r\nby
    them and the developing world producers, and that isnâ\x80\x99t always\r\noccurring.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThe
    problems to which Wilson refers are ones that no one, most notably\r\nFairtrade
    officials and advocates, deny. Namely, that Fairtrade isnâ\x80\x99t\r\nperfect,
    and that one consequence of its imperfection can be a\r\ndisconnect between what
    consumers are promised for the premium they pay,\r\nand what is delivered. For
    example, an investigation a few years ago by\r\nthe UKâ\x80\x99s Financial Times,
    found that some fair trade farmers were not\r\npaying their labour the legal minimum
    wage, though these workers were\r\ngetting 25% more than those picking coffee
    on conventional farms.\r\n\r\nIn an article on the IPA website, Wilson suggests
    that on the evidence\r\nof history, such problems are without remedy. â\x80\x9CThe
    International Coffee\r\nAgreement operated for most of the Cold War period to
    help developing\r\nworld coffee producers lift themselves out of poverty. It was
    a\r\nmonumental failure.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nElsewhere he contends that even if fair
    trade could be made to work,\r\nthere is little reason to bother, because free
    trade provides all the\r\nequity and justice this world needs: â\x80\x9CFree trade
    hasâ\x80¦worked for many,\r\nmany years nowâ\x80¦The fairest outcome [results]
    from a system where prices\r\nare set by the marketplace.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nYeah,
    and pigs fly. Throughout history an unregulated market has brought\r\nus gross
    disparities of wealth, corruption, child labour and sweatshops.\r\nAs that screaming
    left-winger Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the US\r\nFederal Reserve, conceded
    in a recent speech, it has also delivered the\r\nsub-prime mortgage crisis.\r\n\r\nThe
    IPA has long been funded by the major corporates: BHP-Billiton,\r\nMonsanto, Caltex
    and Gunns to name a few. Businesses that have done well\r\nfrom existing trade
    conditions and would like to see them roll on. Weâ\x80\x99re\r\nstill waiting
    for Peruvian coffee-growers to fund a think-tank. The\r\nIPAâ\x80\x99s objections
    to ethical consumerism are vested and ideological, in\r\nother words, not a response
    to the occasional promise/reality gap that\r\nthe fair trade movement is working
    hard to fix.\r\n\r\nIt is easy for self-serving cynics to drain our idealism.
    Easy to make\r\nus feel that however good our intentions and however much we try,
    there\r\nis nothing we can do to make the world a fairer place. So we might as\r\nwell
    just shut up and shop.\r\n\r\nDonâ\x80\x99t believe the hype. While itâ\x80\x99s
    neither enough nor perfect, ethical\r\nconsumerism is better than business-as-usual.
