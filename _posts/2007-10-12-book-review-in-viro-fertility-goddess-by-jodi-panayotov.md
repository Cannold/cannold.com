    ISBN 978~~0~~9803110~~0~~6\r\n\r\nInfertility sucks and IVF is worse. Yet women
    rarely talk about\r\neither, or make jokes, a truth Jodi Panayotov found out the
    hard way\r\nwhen aged 37 she struggled to get pregnant and to stay that way.\r\n\r\nIt
    never fails to amaze me the insensitive things people say to women\r\nwho, after
    a few years of wedded bliss, fail to spawn. The comment by\r\nPanayotovâ\x80\x99s
    fellow stewardess is typical. â\x80\x9CYouâ\x80\x99ve been married for years\r\nnow,
    when are you going to have a baby?â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nHow I wish all women would
    react as Panayotov did that day. â\x80\x9CActually, I\r\njust lost one, miscarriage
    you know.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nWhen a non-pregnant stewardess approaches Panayotov
    shortly after this\r\nincident to confide that sheâ\x80\x99d also had a miscarriage
    but had only told\r\nher family about it, Panayotov responds with a question revelatory
    of\r\nthe driving motivation behind In Vitro Fertility Goddess. â\x80\x9CWhy is
    it we\r\ndonâ\x80\x99t talk about it? Itâ\x80\x99s like there â\x80\x98s a hidden
    code of silence of\r\nsomething. Iâ\x80\x99ve never in ten years of working here
    heard of one\r\nmiscarriage. And Iâ\x80\x99ve heard all about every birth.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIn
    Vitro Fertility Goddess is Panayotovâ\x80\x99s attempt to talk, even laugh,\r\nabout
    the reproductive difficulties faced by she and her husband Michel.\r\nFrom the
    early days of her journey where repeated miscarriages saw her\r\njoin â\x80\x9Cthe
    freakish underclass somewhere between the Fertile and\r\nInfertileâ\x80\x9D that
    only exists on â\x80\x9Cobscure websitesâ\x80\x9D because â\x80\x9Cnobodyâ\x80¦admits\r\nto
    being [a] member,â\x80\x9D to Panayotovâ\x80\x99s reluctant commencement of IVF,\r\nInfertility
    Treatment Goddess contributes to the growing recognition\r\nthat women suffer
    psychic and physical costs not just when they are\r\nunable to control their bodies
    and their lives in order to avoid having\r\nchildren, but when such control eludes
    them when they try to conceive.\r\n\r\nIn Vitro Fertility Goddess has much going
    for it. Taking a stylistic\r\nleaf out of Bridget Jonesâ\x80\x99s Diary it is
    at times laugh-out-loud funny. A\r\nmedical receptionist retreats when a miscarrying
    Panayotov yells at her,\r\nâ\x80\x9Cas if a large dog has mounted and is attempting
    to have sex with her.â\x80\x9D\r\nWhen Panayotov confesses to seeing a herbalist
    to cure her fertility\r\nwoes, her IVF doctor goes â\x80\x9Call quiet,â\x80\x9D
    as if she were confessing to\r\nâ\x80\x9Cjoining the Branch Davidians or something.â\x80\x9D
    And like Brigette Jones, it\r\npromises and delivers an insight into the minds
    of women whose\r\ncircumstances rather than choices have derailed their lives
    from\r\nconventional female courses, and a conclusion (one we know about from\r\nthe
    start courtesy of the mother-baby photo gracing the bookâ\x80\x99s back\r\ncover)
    that rewards the heroineâ\x80\x99s struggles with happy-ever-afters.\r\n\r\nWhat
    works less well is the unevenness of the bookâ\x80\x99s tone and style, the\r\nunreflective
    way the text conflates embryos and babies and the\r\nunmitigated bitchyness of
    the authorâ\x80\x99s lambasting of fertile women as\r\neither â\x80\x9Csmug pregnantsâ\x80\x9D
    or selfish aborters whose mere existence\r\ndemonstrates an insensitivity to Panayotovâ\x80\x99s
    plight that makes her wish\r\nto purchase a voodoo doll so she can prick them
    in effigy.\r\n\r\nFew, if any of these not insubstantial problems, are Panayotovâ\x80\x99s
    fault.\r\nAuthors are not editors, and this book reads like the first draft a\r\npromising
    manuscript, rather than the final text of a published work.\r\nGrammatical errors,
    contradictions and repetitiveness (we are told twice\r\nabout a neighbourâ\x80\x99s
    front window sticker welcoming dogs but not\r\nchildren, and as many times about
    the unsavoury details of the clinic\r\nmasturbation room in which husband Michel
    fulfils his end of the IVF\r\nbargain), the loss of Bridget Jones voice during
    parts of the narration\r\nand a complete absence of humour during what was clearly
    the most\r\nemotionally trying part of the Panayotovsâ\x80\x99 journey to parenthood
    are\r\njust the sort of problems the editorial process is designed to identify\r\nand
    assist the author to address.\r\n\r\nThat it failed to do so, and that Panayotovâ\x80\x99s
    editor was her husband\r\nMichel, not only underscores the essential nature of
    editing to the\r\nproduction of quality Australian literary works, but the need
    for that\r\neditorial input to be professional: both skilled and impartial."
