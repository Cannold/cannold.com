    that the contraceptive pill may be inhibiting womenâ\x80\x99s capacity\r\nto conceive
    in more ways than one. Worse, it may be playing havoc with\r\ntheir love lives.\r\n\r\nThe
    most recent findings, published in this monthâ\x80\x99s Proceedings of the\r\nRoyal
    Society, show that women who take the pill have an altered sense\r\nof smell.
    Specifically, they delight in the scents of men who have a\r\nsimilar, rather
    than a complimentary, immune system.\r\n\r\nThe finding follows two other studies,
    both done in the 1990s, that\r\nsuggested oral contraception may disrupt a womanâ\x80\x99s
    pheromone detection\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe implications of such disruption are
    vast. Pheromones play an\r\nimportant role in the normal human mating process.
    If pill-taking women\r\nare drawn to what are, genetically speaking, the â\x80\x9Cwrongâ\x80\x9D
    men, the\r\nresults could include increased difficulties conceiving, higher rates
    of\r\nmiscarriage, longer intervals between pregnancies and-when at last they\r\narrive-genetically
    compromised offspring. Not to mention, given the role\r\nsmell plays in maintaining
    partnerships, more divorces.\r\n\r\nWomen may respond to such research findings
    with the same sense of\r\ndismay, and the same feelings of betrayal, as they did
    to the news that\r\nthose ingesting combination HRT pills to prevent heart disease
    were not\r\nonly wasting their time, but putting their overall health at risk.\r\n\r\nSuch
    a response would be a good thing if it leads Australian women to\r\ntake a more
    active and skeptical role in decisions about what they put\r\nin their bodies.
    The kind of attitude that would lead them to\r\nreject-once and for all-the belief
    that pharmaceuticals interventions\r\nwouldnâ\x80\x99t be licensed, sold or recommended
    unless they were â\x80\x9Csafe.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThe truth is far trickier. According
    to science journalist Ray Moynihan,\r\nthe undisputed expert on this matter, â\x80\x9Ca
    significant proportion of what\r\nmany doctors do for their patients is not based
    on good scientific\r\nevidence.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThere are vast problems with the
    information on which critical decisions\r\nabout our health are currently based.
    They include the fact that, even\r\nwhere data exists, it often does not come
    from the double-blind\r\nplacebo-controlled trials that are the gold standard
    for producing valid\r\nand reliable knowledge about what is safe and effective.\r\n\r\nIndeed,
    even when studies have been done, and done properly, their\r\ncapacity to answer
    the question most women want to know-namely â\x80\x9Cis it\r\nsafe for me to use
    in the long-termâ\x80\x9D-may be limited. This is because the\r\nexpense of conducting
    good research means most studies only look at\r\nshort-term side-effects and fail
    to assemble large and diverse enough\r\nsamples to ensure rare problems-only those
    impacting on women or blacks\r\nor other sub-groups-will be uncovered.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    we need to remember that for the most part, researchers need to\r\nlook for a
    problem to find it. Even a gold standard trial with a large\r\nand diverse sample
    that follows participants for many years will not\r\nuncover cancer as a long-term
    side effect of treatment if heart trouble\r\nis the only complication they are
    measuring.\r\n\r\nSo what should women do? When it comes to pharmaceuticals, a\r\ncommon-sense
    approach would be to ingest and insert as little as\r\npossible. Where something
    must be taken, it seems wise to choose the\r\nleast invasive, most reversible
    and lowest risk option, and to use it\r\nfor the shortest period possible.\r\n\r\nAnd
    if you are currently in the market for a partner with whom to have\r\nchildren?
    It couldnâ\x80\x99t hurt to come off the pill, and have a good sniff\r\naround."
