    (The Abortion Myth) turns her attention to an obscure corner of history: the role
    of women in patriarchal Roman society and Jewish culture during the early years
    of Christianity. Foreshadowing Jesus''s anti-establishment views, Cannold imagines
    that he has a sister, Rachael, a tomboy who tries to defy social restrictions
    on women. Readers accompany her through her successes and failures navigating
    the patriarchal world that seeks to define her as a wife and mother. Cannold develops
    Rachael as a well-rounded, independent, and morally complex character who is not
    solely defined by her relationships with men. Even though the second half of the
    story revolves around her brother Jesus (as Joshua) and her husband Judah (as
    Judas), Rachael remains the focal point of the familiar story as it plays out.
    Rachael''s tragedy is not merely the fact that her brother was martyred and that
    her husband the Messiah''s traitor, but also that she was not allowed to be what
    she wanted to be. Cannold offers a thought-provoking, heartfelt, and tragic but
    redemptive tale about the difficulties of discovering and defining one''s identity
    in a world that seeks unendingly to take that decision away. (Dec.)'
