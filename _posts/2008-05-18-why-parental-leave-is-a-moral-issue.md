    has developed radical connotations. Said the Government of\r\nthe latest inquiry:

    what John Howard thought about working mothers (those who\r\nwere married, anyway.
    The single ones he condemned as dole-bludgers). In\r\na desperate attempt to swing
    the PM their way, feminists inside and\r\noutside the Liberal party tried to make
    a national leave scheme a small\r\ntarget by arguing that women needed it to be
    good women: so they could\r\nbreastfeed longer, bond better with their babies
    and keep their young\r\nfrom the devilâ\x80\x99s playground called childcare.
    Said then Sex\r\nDiscrimination Commissioner Pru Goward, â\x80\x9CIt is very unusual
    to find\r\nwomen in Europeâ\x80¦going back to work with children under the age
    of 6\r\nmonths as you increasingly find in Australia, with all the implications\r\nthat
    has with breast-feeding, for the recovery of the mother and for the\r\ndevelopment
    of the childâ\x80¦[it is] a scandal that so many babies are being\r\nleft in careâ\x80¦â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIt
    didnâ\x80\x99t work. Worse, it left us with an antediluvian way of talking\r\nabout
    the kind of leave we want, and why we want it that threatens our\r\ncapacity to
    win something worth having.\r\n\r\nWe need to start fresh. From the premise that
    both Australian men and\r\nwomen do work, want to work or need to work and that
    when they partner,\r\nmost want to have kids. This makes the central policy question:
    how can\r\nwe help them do both?\r\n\r\nSuch a gender-neutral frame presumes what
    most of us know to be true.\r\nThat parents have a responsibility to share the
    work and pleasure of\r\ncaring and earning. That they need to give their kids
    the benefits of\r\nbeing cared for by both parents and model for their children
    the\r\ncapacity of both genders to move with ease and independence between home\r\nand
    the wider world.\r\n\r\nParental, not maternity, leave is the only moral policy
    choice."
