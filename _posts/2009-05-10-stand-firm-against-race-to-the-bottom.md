    Trading System\r\n\r\nGlobal warming is the most significant moral issue of our
    time. Current\r\ngenerations still have a choice. We can act to reduce dangerous
    climate\r\nchange or persist with business as usual, despite knowing that doing
    so\r\nrisks denying our children the most fundamental of birthrights - a\r\nhabitable
    planet. That we know this, yet seem collectively incapable of\r\npulling ourselves
    together to do what is right and necessary, offers a\r\ndepressingly instructive
    lesson on the limits of our species and the\r\nsystems of governance under which
    we labour.\r\n\r\nSenators, you are right to say the governmentâ\x80\x99s cap
    and trade scheme is\r\nnot good enough. The Rudd Governmentâ\x80\x99s target of
    5 to 15 per cent is too\r\nlow, and far too many free permits to pollute will
    be handed out. A cap\r\nand trade scheme is all about putting a price on carbon
    and getting\r\npolluters to pay. Yet the Rudd scheme is all about rewarding precisely\r\nthose
    businesses that knew a market-based scheme to reduce pollution was\r\ncoming,
    but did little to prepare for the change.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the politics
    on the issue is now running the wrong\r\nway. This weekâ\x80\x99s announcement
    by Kevin Rudd that emissions trading will\r\nbe delayed until 2011, and that big
    polluters will get another $2.2\r\nbillion in handouts seems designed to wedge
    the Opposition in order to\r\ncapture the votes of the Liberals in the Senate
    later, on a more\r\nneutered bill. It signals a race to the bottom on climate
    change in\r\npreference to an improvement in the environmental credentials of
    the\r\nscheme in order to cultivate you.\r\n\r\nYou must try to turn this around.
    To deal yourself back into the\r\nunseemly political horse-trading around the
    planetâ\x80\x99s future so that an\r\nemissions trading scheme with its fundamental
    features intact can be put\r\ninto place.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because while there are
    other carbon reduction policies we can\r\npursue, emissions trading matters. Cap
    and trade schemes are the\r\ncheapest and most efficient way of getting business
    to change its ways\r\nfor the good of the environment. History shows that, once
    in place,\r\nbusiness adjusts and gets on with it. But it also shows that to get
    a\r\nscheme in place, concessions must be made to the most egregious\r\npolluters.\r\n\r\nTake
    Europe. They got their cap and trade system in 2005, but its had\r\nlittle impact
    on emissions because too many free permits were granted\r\nand offsets allowed.
    Nonetheless, the existence of the scheme encouraged\r\ninnovation and changed
    business investment and operational decisions.\r\nExperts interviewed on ABC Radioâ\x80\x99s
    Rear Vision now expect that when the\r\nnext phase of the scheme begins in 2013,
    most permits will be auctioned\r\ninstead of given away, and real emissions reductions
    will finally be\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\nTo get a cap and trade scheme, Europe bought
    the business lobby off to\r\nstop its squawking. Australia must do the same, but
    with you-the Greens\r\nand Independents-cutting the deal, not the Liberals, who
    say the\r\ngovernmentâ\x80\x99s scheme is structurally flawed. If they call the
    shots, the\r\nfundamentals of a cap and trade scheme could be bargained away.\r\n\r\nCompromise
    hurts. It hurts all the more when those forcing you to the\r\nmat are as ethical
    as raptors. But sometimes in politics it is those\r\nwith the foresight and fortitude
    to insist on baby steps that triumph in\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nI wish you all success."
