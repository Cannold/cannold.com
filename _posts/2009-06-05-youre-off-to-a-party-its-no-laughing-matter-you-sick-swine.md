    catch the virus? If you are invited to one, should you attend?\r\nShould viral
    socialites be shunned and pilloried, or are they providing\r\na much-needed warning
    to those in charge of public communications about\r\nH1N1 that they need to think
    again?\r\n\r\nOur family has been upfront and personal with H1N1 influenza, or
    human\r\nswine flu. One son has taken a course of Tamiflu after discovering the\r\nchild
    he takes the train to school with each morning was diagnosed with\r\nit. The otherâ\x80\x99s
    school closed on Monday after a run of confirmed cases.\r\n\r\nThroughout the
    siege, notes, emails and website updates have been\r\nflying. Official advice
    has streamed from newspaper and radio. Crudely\r\nsummarised, the central message
    is this: â\x80\x9CDo everything you can to avoid\r\ncatching and spreading swine
    flu. But if you or your kids do get it,\r\ndonâ\x80\x99t panic. Itâ\x80\x99s no
    big deal.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, such advice is confusing. Particularly
    so to those with\r\na high degree of motivation to make sense of what they are
    being told so\r\nthey can act on it - namely parents responsible for protecting
    their\r\nkids. Such parents are likely to be among the approximately 10 per cent\r\nof
    Victorians who are alert, alarmed and ready to act when a public\r\nhealth crisis
    is at hand, not the 90 per cent who are described by risk\r\ncommunication experts
    as apathetic.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, swine flu parties are the consequence of poor\r\ncommunications
    from health officials to the public about the crisis.\r\nSuch one-size-fits-all
    messaging might have caused a minority to believe\r\n- mistakenly as it turns
    out- that a swine flu party is an intelligent\r\nresponse to the risks posed by
    the pandemic. In the face of confusing\r\nofficial advice and an absence of additional
    information to explain why\r\nthat advice actually makes sense, educated and anxious
    people have\r\nfilled in the blanks.\r\n\r\nThey have assumed that getting infected
    with swine flu today causes mild\r\nillness but confers immunity against future,
    more virulent strains, and\r\nso the light bulb concept of the swine flu party
    was born.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, both assumptions are mistaken, or at least premature.\r\nIt
    may be that swine flu only ever causes mild sickness in those who\r\ncatch it,
    or it may turn out that some people actually wind up in\r\nhospital or dead. Perhaps
    certain subsections of the population are\r\nparticularly vulnerable. There simply
    have not been enough cases and\r\nenough time for experts to draw definite conclusions
    from the data weâ\x80\x99ve\r\ngot. There is also no certainty that those who
    come down with H1N1 today\r\nwill have protection from a mutated and more virulent
    strain tomorrow\r\nor, if they do, how long such protection will last.\r\n\r\nSwine
    parties may also cause unintended and unsavoury consequences for\r\nthose who
    didnâ\x80\x99t attend. The greater the number who catch the virus, the\r\ngreater
    the odds that those who may be particularly vulnerable - very\r\nyoung children,
    pregnant women - will be exposed. Doing what we can to\r\nslow transmission, not
    speed it up, gives time for a vaccine to be\r\navailable to protect high-risk
    groups.\r\n\r\nIt also extends, rather than compresses, the mutation timeline,
    reducing\r\nthe likelihood that we will face a more virulent strain, or at least\r\ndelaying
    it, giving us more time to prepare.\r\n\r\nI feel confident no one planning or
    attending a swine flu party intends\r\nto cause harm, either to themselves or
    others. My point is that unless\r\nhealth officials engage more effectively with
    the segment of the\r\ncommunity that is actively engaged with the crisis, such
    intellectual\r\nerrors - and the unwise decisions that follow in their wake -
    are\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nSo what can we do? Already, the World Health Organisation
    has signalled\r\nits intention to revise its definition of pandemic in response
    to what\r\nit has learned from the H1N1 outbreak so far. The new definition is\r\nlikely
    to take in the severity of future viruses, not just their spread.\r\n\r\nAustralian
    political leaders and health bureaucrats need to be similarly\r\nbold in their
    assessment of what has worked, and what hasnâ\x80\x99t, in their\r\ncommunications
    to the public about swine flu. In particular, they need\r\nto ditch the monolithic
    idea of â\x80\x9Cthe publicâ\x80\x9D altogether.\r\n\r\nInstead, they need to
    recognise that different sections of the community\r\nneed different types and
    amounts of information in a public health\r\ncrisis. Modern messaging mediums
    and methods must be employed to ensure\r\nmessaging is relevant - in terms of
    both sophistication and volume - to\r\na range of audiences. As the swine flu
    party phenomenon reminds us,\r\neveryoneâ\x80\x99s health depends on it."
