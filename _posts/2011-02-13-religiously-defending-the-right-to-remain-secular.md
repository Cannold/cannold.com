  content: "This column is about lawlessness, and what your government is doing in\r\nyour
    name. Or, more accurately, how itâ\x80\x99s spending your money while\r\ndodging
    the oversight of Parliament in direct contravention of the law.\r\n\r\nIt is about
    the High Court challenge to the National School Chaplaincy\r\nProgram and the
    reason why - whatever you think of school chaplains,\r\nlove or hate â\x80\x99em
    - you should be hoping the challenge succeeds. Any\r\nAustralian who cares about
    the primacy of the law over the electoral\r\nfortunes of the political party in
    power should.\r\n\r\nOn the surface, Ron Williams v Commonwealth of Australia
    is about\r\nWilliams, a father of six who wants his children to attend a secular\r\nschool.
    By secular he means a school that is neutral when it comes to\r\nreligion - a
    school that teaches kids about religions but doesnâ\x80\x99t\r\npromote belief
    over non-belief or the belief system of one faith over\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nSo Williams
    sent his brood to the local state school, assuming it would\r\nfit the bill. It
    didnâ\x80\x99t. Instead, his children were asked for gold coins\r\nto take for
    Scripture Union on crazy hair day or made to attend\r\nassemblies where the chaplain
    presided and a rap song was played\r\nextolling the virtues of chaplains over
    teachers as adults kids could\r\ntrust.\r\n\r\nWilliamsâ\x80\x99s desire is simple
    - to pull the plug on the program that,\r\nthrough â\x80\x9Cchaplaincy service
    providersâ\x80\x9D such as Scripture Union\r\n(â\x80\x9CChristâ\x80\x99s ambassadors
    on the front line of ministryâ\x80\x9D) and Access\r\nMinistries (â\x80\x9Ctransform[ing]
    this nation for Godâ\x80\x9D), is feverishly trying\r\nto spend the $437 million
    of Commonwealth funds to put a chaplain in all\r\nthe nationâ\x80\x99s schools.\r\n\r\nBut
    like all cases heard by the High Court, this one is primarily about\r\nlegal principles
    of governance. Such as whether our government is\r\nallocating our money in a
    fair, honest and transparent way, and in\r\naccordance with the constitution.\r\n\r\nWilliams
    says it isnâ\x80\x99t. He asserts that the Howard, Rudd and Gillard\r\ngovernments
    have waved aside proper procedure to deliver wads of cash to\r\na persistent and
    feared constituency. Legislate for school chaplains?\r\nWhy risk parliamentary
    scrutiny and possible rejection? Instead, weâ\x80\x99ll\r\njust slide the money
    into the yearly Appropriations Act under some\r\ninnocuous item in the education
    budget.\r\n\r\nAbsolute powerâ\x80\x99s nice when you can get it but we live in
    a society\r\ngoverned by laws. The kind of place where a little guy such as Williams\r\n-
    with the help of generous advocates and micro-donations from\r\nwell-wishers -
    can have his day in court to say â\x80\x9Cno wayâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nNo way should
    buckets of taxpayer money be doled out without Parliament\r\nhaving a say about
    the matter. No way should allocations be made in ways\r\nthat violate the constitution
    - in particular, the bit that says the\r\ngovernment canâ\x80\x99t insist an Australian
    be a person of faith, or belong to\r\na particular faith, to get a job. This is
    something that the\r\ngovernmentâ\x80\x99s own guidelines and practices make clear
    is necessary for\r\nchaplains.\r\n\r\nThe laws Williams is fighting to have enforced
    - government by and for\r\nthe people, the religious neutrality of the state -
    go to the heart of\r\nwhat I love about this country. Letâ\x80\x99s hope for all
    our sakes he wins."
