WILL the carping of stem cell opponents never cease? First they insist
their opposition to liberalisation of the laws governing embryo research
is grounded in concern about women being exploited for their eggs. Then,
one by one, they misrepresent and then reject every scientific
alternative proposed to find alternative sources for such eggs.

Senator Kay Patterson’s bill has already been stripped of its provision
enabling scientists to create patient-matched stem cells using animal
eggs (one solution to claimed concerns about increased pressure on women
to donate). Now Monique Baldwin (“Pro-cloning activists shroud the
truth”, Opinion, 28/11) wants to deprive scientists of other means of
generating pluripotent stem cells - those able to generate any tissue in
the body.

Sure there is a “yuk factor” attached to the use of donated immature
eggs from cadavers and female fetuses. But for most people, that is far
preferable to Baldwin’s plan to cripple or kill Australian scientists’
pursuit of stem cell cures.
