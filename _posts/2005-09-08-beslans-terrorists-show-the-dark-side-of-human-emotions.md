  content: "*Damaged children grow up to believe that only violence can change*\r\n\r\nLike
    most Australians I have been devastated by the unfolding tragedy in\r\nRussia.
    Or perhaps even more so. I have school age children, and like\r\nmany parents,
    was overwhelmed with pity for those pacing helpless and\r\nunknowing outside the
    mined school building: Were their children\r\nthirsty? Hurt? Dead? I was similarly
    undone by the Jaiden Leskie case\r\nseveral years ago: Jaiden was the age of my
    youngest son when he\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nMy fretfulness during the Beslan siege,
    and my mournful grief for the\r\nparents as they wail and bury their dead, is
    empathy: the emotion\r\nprovoked in normal people by the suffering of others.
    It is the quality\r\npsychopaths and serial killers lack and, experts increasingly
    believe,\r\none that must be nurtured during a childâ\x80\x99s early years to
    develop\r\nproperly. Chronic poverty, political powerlessness and social\r\nindifference:
    these are the social conditions that undermine the ability\r\nof parents to raise
    adults with the capacity to feel the pain of others,\r\nand to live peacefully
    in society as one of us. These same conditions\r\nfoster the belief amongst such
    damaged children that violence is the\r\nonly salve for their pent-up anger and
    frustration, and the only route\r\nto change.\r\n\r\nThere can be no forgiveness
    of what the Beslan terrorists did to the\r\nchildren and parents of that town.
    Nor does there need to be. They have\r\nviolated the most sacred responsibility
    of adults to children - to\r\nprotect them and offer them a future - and in doing
    so have made them,\r\nindeed all of us, feel like failures. Justice, rough or
    otherwise, is\r\nmore than they deserve.\r\n\r\nBut how best to honour the dead
    and the children who survived? How do we\r\nmake it up to them? Their parents
    will do the small things: hold them\r\nwhen they cry, soothe their restless sleep.
    Mother Russia is already\r\ntalking tough about beefed-up security, leading some
    to fear a return to\r\nSoviet-style oppression.\r\n\r\nWill this make the children
    feel safe? Perhaps, but perhaps not - itâ\x80\x99s\r\nnever held much water with
    my kids. Even a ten-year old understands it\r\nonly takes one terrorist to slip
    through the net for tragedy to occur.\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s normal, understandable
    and entirely forgivable for individuals and\r\nsocieties whoâ\x80\x99ve suffered
    in Beslan, after Bali and on 9/11 to want\r\nretribution. But more for practical
    reasons than moral ones, an eye for\r\nan eye will never be the answer. In the
    past many Irish terrorists, and\r\nPalestinian ones today, were the terrorized
    children of yesterday,\r\nretaliating against someone - anyone - for the sudden
    and traumatic\r\ndeath of a loved one that sometimes took place before their eyes.
    It is\r\nsaid the claimed organiser of the Beslan siege lost 11 family members
    in\r\na Russian assault on Chechnya. And so it goes. In the end, an eye for an\r\neye
    just leaves blind, toothless and scared to death.\r\n\r\nGiving our children a
    future demands we adults do the hardest thing\r\nthere is: insist on seeing the
    terrorists as human. Yes, itâ\x80\x99s easier to\r\ndismiss them as â\x80\x9Canimalsâ\x80\x9D
    and [fanatics]() inexplicably severed from\r\nnormal human emotions and aspirations;
    monsters at birth who were never\r\nlike us. But until we recognise terrorists
    as the sharp-edge of icebergs\r\nof social deprivation and despair, their distorted
    humanity sourced in\r\nsome real-world trauma that could have been different and
    could still\r\nchange, it is we who lose.\r\n\r\nThis is no Christian turn the
    other cheek, nor an argument for\r\nforgiveness and understanding. Those who perform
    terrorist acts deserve\r\nneither. Nor is it the soft-end of an either/or solution
    that has better\r\ncrisis response and heightened security at the other pole.
    In the short\r\nterm at least, we must do both.\r\n\r\nInstead, it is a pragmatic
    approach to seeing our way clear to another\r\nsort of future for the children
    of Beslan, and our children, too. A\r\nfuture where it is possible to feel safe,
    to trust others and to plan\r\nfor the future. Not because there are more security
    checks and\r\nrazor-wire. But because we live in a world that doesnâ\x80\x99t
    make terrorists\r\nany more."
