    reader named Pria asks whether the man she describes as her â\x80\x9Cboyfriend\r\n-
    so-calledâ\x80\x9D is impolite or unethical.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CSo-calledâ\x80\x9D
    arranges dates at the last minute, then breaks them even\r\nlater, leaving Pria
    home alone on a Saturday night â\x80\x9Cwatching old movies\r\nand tweezing my
    pubic line . . . to kill the timeâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nHer friends say she can and
    should do better but Pria wants more. She\r\nwants them to agree with her that
    the â\x80\x9Cinconsiderate, self-centredâ\x80\x9D\r\nbloke is more than just rude.
    Heâ\x80\x99s immoral.\r\n\r\nWhat, she wonders, do I think?\r\n\r\nEthicists like
    to draw a firm distinction between ethics and etiquette\r\nbut the truth is that
    the categories overlap.\r\n\r\nAt their most trivial, manners are about preserving
    class distinctions\r\nthrough the enforcement of rigid, and at times nonsensical,
    codes of\r\nbehaviour for when one is in the company of (relative) strangers.\r\n\r\nProscriptions
    against putting your elbows on the table or touching the\r\nQueen unless she extends
    her hand first are good examples.\r\n\r\nBut at the pointier end of etiquette,
    the distinction between manners\r\nand morals all but disappears. Prohibitions
    on interrupting may serve\r\nthe more superficial goal of smoothing the rough
    edges of conversational\r\nengagements but also provide a way for individuals
    to indicate their\r\nmoral respect for others through the other-centred act of
    listening.\r\n\r\nA person who constantly interrupts may show not just that he
    is\r\nill-bred, but so self-absorbed that the only personâ\x80\x99s ideas and
    feelings\r\nhe deems worth hearing are his own. From the sound of it, Pria is
    right.\r\nâ\x80\x9CSo-calledâ\x80\x9D seems to be afflicted not just by a deficit
    of manners, but\r\nof morals, too. Yes, it is rude to cancel arrangements at short
    notice.\r\nSometimes, however, it cannot be avoided.\r\n\r\nWhen the inconvenience
    caused by such breach of etiquette is accompanied\r\nby an apology, a sincere
    promise to avoid it happening again and\r\nreimbursement for all wasted depilation
    and hair-styling efforts (just\r\njoking, sort of) it can and should be forgiven.\r\n\r\nBut
    chronic rudeness on this or other fronts may indicate the presence\r\nof more
    serious moral disorders. A man who continually backs out of\r\narrangements with
    a woman is communicating a number of things.\r\n\r\nAmong them is, â\x80\x9CMy
    time, and all the terribly important things I do with\r\nit, is more important
    than yours.â\x80\x9D To say this to another, or imply it\r\nthrough your actions,
    is imperious and high-handed. Not just rude but\r\nmorally arrogant.\r\n\r\nIt
    could even be indicative, in extreme cases, of narcissism - extreme\r\nselfishness
    and excessive self-love resulting in an inability to sustain\r\nlong-term relationships.
    If â\x80\x9Cso-calledâ\x80\x9D is â\x80\x9Cjust not that intoâ\x80\x9D Pria -\r\nand
    it certainly sounds this way - he should have the decency to say so.\r\nItâ\x80\x99s
    not a crime not to love someone - you either do or you donâ\x80\x99t - but\r\nit
    is wrong to treat someone as if she were unloveable.\r\n\r\nIf â\x80\x9Cso-calledâ\x80\x9D
    canâ\x80\x99t or wonâ\x80\x99t love Pria, he needs to do the right thing\r\nand
    let her go, so she can find someone who will.\r\n\r\nThe fact that she has not
    demanded this, and may even have acted like a\r\ndoormat in some ways when it
    came to â\x80\x9Cso-calledâ\x80\x99sâ\x80\x9D repeated antics, does\r\nnot entirely
    excuse him from walking all over her. He needs to take a\r\ngood hard look at
    himself and, for her own good, Pria does, too."
