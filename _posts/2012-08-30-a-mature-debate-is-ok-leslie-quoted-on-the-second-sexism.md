  content: "DAVID Benatar knew what was coming. In the preface to his new book The
    Second Sexism, the South African professor attempted to get in first. ''It is
    worth pre-empting the joke that a book about discrimination against males must
    be a very short book,'' he wrote.\r\n\r\nAt almost 300 pages, the book, published
    earlier this year, is no pamphlet, but for the University of Cape Town head of
    philosophy, it remains ''relatively short'', although not, he stresses, because
    of the limited nature or the seriousness of the issue it raises.\r\n\r\n''Instead
    it is [partly] because a longer book is not required to show that there is an
    extensive and dangerous second sexism,'' says Benatar.\r\n\r\nReally? Sexism against
    men? And dangerous at that? Cue derisive laughter. Which is exactly the flavour
    of much of the reaction the book received when it came out.\r\n\r\n''Are men the
    new women?'' railed Suzanne Moore in Britain's The Guardian. ''Are they having
    a harder time than silly moaning ladies? Has feminism gone too far? Has political
    correctness been put away for its own good? These are such familiar cultural tropes
    that we may dismiss the word trope altogether. Instead I would use another word:
    tripe.''\r\n\r\nAnd this from Arifa Akbar in The Independent: ''â\x80¦ it all
    sounds slightly churlish, given the structural inequalities that women deal with.
    If Professor Benatar can point out just one country on the planet in which men
    and women are paid equally and have the same opportunities available to them,
    then I'm very prepared to take the concept of second sexism seriously.''\r\n\r\nFor
    his part, Benatar obviously was aware that what he was proposing was incendiary,
    hence his anticipation of the certain derision. He had aired his views before
    the book was published, and been duly rounded upon.\r\n\r\n''It's disappointing,''
    he says from his Cape Town office, ''because a lot of people I think just don't
    read the book. They don't read what the argument says. And I think a lot of people
    who do read what one says have such preconceived ideas, and such firmly preconceived
    ideas, that they just dismiss this as outrageous. There is a certain group of
    people who want an exclusive focus on women, and who think that women are the
    only victims. The suggestion that men might also be victims is threatening to
    them in some way.''\r\n\r\nThe key to Benatar's argument is the title of the book.
    The first sexism is against women, the second against men - and recognition of
    the latter is not a denial of the former. In countries where discrimination has
    been recognised, he says, the focus has been on women and girls. ''The second
    sexism is the neglected sexism, the sexism that is not taken seriously even by
    most of those who oppose (or at least claim they oppose) sex discrimination,''
    he writes.\r\n\r\nHe identifies several areas where he believes men have been
    discriminated against, including the view that only men should be conscripted
    into military service, and only men sent into combat. While some women are excluded
    from combat, he writes, many more are exempt.\r\n\r\nBenatar says men are also
    more often victims of violence, are subjected to more corporal punishment, have
    poorer education outcomes, and higher imprisonment rates.\r\n\r\nIt is a debate
    that has found expression in Australia recently with the controversy over two
    cases in which airlines moved men away from unaccompanied children because, as
    males, they were considered potential threats.\r\n\r\nIn their professional lives,
    the two men are carers and protectors - a fireman and a nurse. They were affronted
    and humiliated by the airlines' policy, and their experiences fired a lively and
    at times revealing debate. A poll on the airlines' actions on Fairfax's news sites
    produced 44,000 votes, with 87 per cent of people agreeing the rule was ''sexist
    and suggests all men are potential paedophiles''. Social media also buzzed, reflecting
    a view that the airlines' actions were discriminatory.\r\n\r\nYet there were also
    voices of dissent, including a mother posting on Facebook she appreciated the
    airlines' policy. She told of her own experience of a male passenger being discreetly
    moved away from her children. ''And, you know what, as a mum I was comfortable
    with the decision.''\r\n\r\nAnd the attitude behind the airlines' policy is also
    evidenced in other parts of society. The scarcity of male early childhood teachers
    reflects the level of suspicion about men and young children.\r\n\r\nThe Australia
    Education Union's Martel Menz says the profession is 98 per cent female. In part,
    that reflects a perceived lack of career path and structure. ''It's historically
    a profession of low pay, low status,'' says Menz, who is a union deputy vice-president.
    ''It's not terribly attractive to a lot of guys, unfortunately.''\r\n\r\nBut gender
    is also a deterrent, she says. ''Sadly, the way that parts of society view men
    going into those professions is with some suspicion and some disdain. 'Why would
    you want to do that for a career or a profession?' Which is awful, I think. I've
    worked with some terrific male early childhood teachers and they're brilliant.
    The way they can connect with young children is just fantastic.\r\n\r\n''I think
    it's a real shame because obviously young children can benefit from role models
    of both genders and we just don't have enough blokes in our system at the moment.''\r\n\r\nOne
    of those blokes to make a career in early childhood teaching is Max Grarock, who
    has taken a year away from teaching to work for a training organisation. Grarock
    found his gender was, in fact, an advantage when he was applying for jobs. ''You
    really stand out in a positive way,'' he says. ''People respond to that really
    well.''\r\n\r\nThe issue arose, however, when his appointment to a new centre
    was announced. At least one or two parents would then withdraw their children.\r\n\r\nMale
    teachers are not an issue in the primary years, and are often sought after by
    parents. But, as Grarock explains, ''There's something about the whole preschool
    thing really puts people's nerves on edge.\r\n\r\n''I don't know what it is. I
    talk about it in a fairly blase way now because I really genuinely am over it,
    but I think it really did offend me quite deeply to begin with.'' There was a
    sense, he says, of ''everybody watching you''.\r\n\r\nGrarock, now a parent himself,
    understands that parents with young children may react the way they do: sleep-deprived
    and under pressure, they may not be thinking rationally. ''I understand why that
    is now,'' he says. There was also a flip side to his gender, finding he was given
    greater respect in other areas.\r\n\r\n''I know a lot of female teachers who had
    different issues to me with other things,'' he says. ''I feel like I got an easier
    ride if I talked about the research behind the work we were doing or the curriculum.''\r\n\r\nMax
    Grarock's account of the impact of his gender is reflective, calm and measured.
    But not all discussion about discrimination against men is conducted the same
    way. The emergence of the so-called ''angry man'' - extreme men's movement activists
    who can lose the argument even before it begins because of their demeanour.\r\n\r\nPaul
    Whyte, from the Sydney Men's Network, talks about a sense of ''inflamed victimhood''
    among some men. ''If a woman declares that she's been victimised, decent culture
    accepts that as the case, and proceeds to try to assist: take care of your mother,
    don't harm your sisters, kind of thing.\r\n\r\n''The problem is then that there's
    no public voice for men. What's happened is that there's whole parts of men's
    movements that have almost criminalised themselves by proceeding to talk about
    their victimisation.''\r\n\r\nIn effect, the men's sense of outrage has become
    self-fulfilling, confirming the sense that they cannot control themselves. ''People
    who have been subjected to men's mistreatment when they are upset cannot tell
    the difference between these men and the people who perpetrated against them.
    They just cannot tell the difference.''\r\n\r\nBenatar says that while anger can
    be justified, he is worried when it clouds judgment. ''So when a man who's angry
    now starts thinking that it's all against men, and that women are all evil or
    all getting the benefit, then I think they've got an oversimplified picture,''
    he says, adding that the same applies to angry women whose judgment has been similarly
    blunted.\r\n\r\nThe academic argues there is a need to ''cool it down a bit''.\r\n\r\n''In
    other words, I'm trying to minimise the emotional reactions and get people to
    think a bit more clearly about these issues,'' he says, ''because, I think, when
    one thinks about them, one does recognise the many forms of discrimination against
    males, and also recognises that looking at those isn't going to detract from our
    concern about discrimination against women.''\r\n\r\nThe big difficulty Benatar
    faces in arguing his case is that, while there have been successes in combating
    discrimination against women, there is still a long way to go.\r\n\r\nNovelist
    and ethicist Dr Leslie Cannold believes that progress towards ending discrimination
    against women has stalled. Having established that sexism was wrong, she argues,
    there was an assumption that things would continue to move forward. ''It's not
    actually happened.''\r\n\r\nBut Cannold offers an interesting insight: she speculates
    men are holding on to power in the public world because they feel that women are
    the dominant power in their personal lives.\r\n\r\n''Men either don't believe
    that women are experiencing discrimination in the public world because they experience
    women as so powerful in their private lives, or perhaps they recognise that women
    are disempowered in the public world, but they don't want to relinquish their
    public power until they have wrestled more power back in the home.''\r\n\r\nAs
    for the debate about discrimination against men, Cannold says: ''I don't think
    the conversation is damaging if it's handled maturely.''\r\n\r\nBenatar argues
    that everyone should be concerned about discrimination on the basis of sex, whatever
    that sex might be. Not only because it is the right thing to do, but because we
    should care about people of the opposite sex.\r\n\r\n''Women are going to have
    sons, they're going to have husbands, they are going to have fathers who are the
    victims of this discrimination,'' he says.\r\n\r\n''From a purely egoistic point
    of view they should be concerned about those forms of discrimination.''\r\n\r\nShane

  Union's Martel Menz says the profession is 98 per cent female. In part, that reflects
  a perceived lack of career path and structure. ''It's historically a profession
  of low pay, low status,'' says Menz, who is a union deputy vice-president. ''It's
  not terribly attractive to a lot of guys, unfortunately.''\r\n\r\nBut gender is
  also a deterrent, she says. ''Sadly, the way that parts of society view men going
  into those professions is with some suspicion and some disdain. 'Why would you want
  to do that for a career or a profession?' Which is awful, I think. I've worked with
  some terrific male early childhood teachers and they're brilliant. The way they
  can connect with young children is just fantastic.\r\n\r\n''I think it's a real
  shame because obviously young children can benefit from role models of both genders
  and we just don't have enough blokes in our system at the moment.''\r\n\r\nOne of
  those blokes to make a career in early childhood teaching is Max Grarock, who has
  taken a year away from teaching to work for a training organisation. Grarock found
  his gender was, in fact, an advantage when he was applying for jobs. ''You really
  stand out in a positive way,'' he says. ''People respond to that really well.''\r\n\r\nThe
  issue arose, however, when his appointment to a new centre was announced. At least
  one or two parents would then withdraw their children.\r\n\r\nMale teachers are
  not an issue in the primary years, and are often sought after by parents. But, as
  Grarock explains, ''There's something about the whole preschool thing really puts
  people's nerves on edge.\r\n\r\n''I don't know what it is. I talk about it in a
  fairly blase way now because I really genuinely am over it, but I think it really
  did offend me quite deeply to begin with.'' There was a sense, he says, of ''everybody
  watching you''.\r\n\r\nGrarock, now a parent himself, understands that parents with
  young children may react the way they do: sleep-deprived and under pressure, they
  may not be thinking rationally. ''I understand why that is now,'' he says. There
  was also a flip side to his gender, finding he was given greater respect in other
  areas.\r\n\r\n''I know a lot of female teachers who had different issues to me with
  other things,'' he says. ''I feel like I got an easier ride if I talked about the
  research behind the work we were doing or the curriculum.''\r\n\r\nMax Grarock's
  account of the impact of his gender is reflective, calm and measured. But not all
  discussion about discrimination against men is conducted the same way. The emergence
  of the so-called ''angry man'' - extreme men's movement activists who can lose the
  argument even before it begins because of their demeanour.\r\n\r\nPaul Whyte, from
  the Sydney Men's Network, talks about a sense of ''inflamed victimhood'' among some
  men. ''If a woman declares that she's been victimised, decent culture accepts that
  as the case, and proceeds to try to assist: take care of your mother, don't harm
  your sisters, kind of thing.\r\n\r\n''The problem is then that there's no public
  voice for men. What's happened is that there's whole parts of men's movements that
  have almost criminalised themselves by proceeding to talk about their victimisation.''\r\n\r\nIn
  effect, the men's sense of outrage has become self-fulfilling, confirming the sense
  that they cannot control themselves. ''People who have been subjected to men's mistreatment
  when they are upset cannot tell the difference between these men and the people
  who perpetrated against them. They just cannot tell the difference.''\r\n\r\nBenatar
  says that while anger can be justified, he is worried when it clouds judgment. ''So
  when a man who's angry now starts thinking that it's all against men, and that women
  are all evil or all getting the benefit, then I think they've got an oversimplified
  picture,'' he says, adding that the same applies to angry women whose judgment has
  been similarly blunted.\r\n\r\nThe academic argues there is a need to ''cool it
  down a bit''.\r\n\r\n''In other words, I'm trying to minimise the emotional reactions
  and get people to think a bit more clearly about these issues,'' he says, ''because,
  I think, when one thinks about them, one does recognise the many forms of discrimination
  against males, and also recognises that looking at those isn't going to detract
  from our concern about discrimination against women.''\r\n\r\nThe big difficulty
  Benatar faces in arguing his case is that, while there have been successes in combating
  discrimination against women, there is still a long way to go.\r\n\r\nNovelist and
  ethicist Dr Leslie Cannold believes that progress towards ending discrimination
  against women has stalled. Having established that sexism was wrong, she argues,
  there was an assumption that things would continue to move forward. ''It's not actually
  happened.''\r\n\r\nBut Cannold offers an interesting insight: she speculates men
  are holding on to power in the public world because they feel that women are the
  dominant power in their personal lives.\r\n\r\n''Men either don't believe that women
  are experiencing discrimination in the public world because they experience women
  as so powerful in their private lives, or perhaps they recognise that women are
  disempowered in the public world, but they don't want to relinquish their public
  power until they have wrestled more power back in the home.''\r\n\r\nAs for the
  debate about discrimination against men, Cannold says: ''I don't think the conversation
  is damaging if it's handled maturely.''\r\n\r\nBenatar argues that everyone should
  be concerned about discrimination on the basis of sex, whatever that sex might be.
  Not only because it is the right thing to do, but because we should care about people
  of the opposite sex.\r\n\r\n''Women are going to have sons, they're going to have
  husbands, they are going to have fathers who are the victims of this discrimination,''
  he says.\r\n\r\n''From a purely egoistic point of view they should be concerned
  about those forms of discrimination.''\r\n\r\nShane Green is a senior writer.\r\n\r\nThis
