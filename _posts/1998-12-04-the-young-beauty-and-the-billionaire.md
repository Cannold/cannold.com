  content: "Why both women and men resent this modern parable.\r\n\r\nWE MAY think
    we know the real story behind this weekâ\x80\x99s report that\r\n67-year-old billionaire
    media magnate Rupert Murdoch intends to marry\r\nhis 31-year-old girlfriend Wendy
    Deng after he divorces Anna Murdoch.\r\nBut what do we know, and what do we think
    we know, about the\r\nrelationship between Murdoch and Deng? And is it truth or
    perception\r\nthat matters in public interpretation and comment about the impending\r\nmarriage?\r\n\r\nLetâ\x80\x99s
    get one thing clear. No one, except perhaps those in Murdochâ\x80\x99s and\r\nDengâ\x80\x99s
    inner circle, actually knows much about the relationship. Yet\r\nmany of us think
    we know that it forms another chapter in a sorry\r\nlateâ\x80\x9320th-century
    cultural tale, in which ageing rich men abandon their\r\nsimilarly ageing wives
    for younger, attractive women. (Remember Paul\r\nHogan and Donald Trump.) The
    women who form such relationships are\r\nsimilarly seen to be engaged in an unholy
    system of barter in which they\r\ntrade their youth and beauty for a share of
    their new husbandâ\x80\x99s power\r\nand money (a la Anna Nicole Smith and Rose
    Hancock).\r\n\r\nRather than speculate on whether the Murdoch-Deng relationship
    conforms\r\nto this stereotype, I would like to examine the assumptions and\r\nanxieties
    that underlie and fuel it.\r\n\r\nThe Billionaire and His Younger New Wife parable
    generates anxiety for\r\nboth men and women. For many women, the dominant concern
    is that men\r\nvalue them only for their transient attributes of youth and beauty.
    An\r\nadditional female apprehension, explicitly read into Paul Hoganâ\x80\x99s\r\nmarital
    break-up, is that while it is the â\x80\x9Coldâ\x80\x9D wife who contributes to\r\ntheir
    husbandâ\x80\x99s rise to fame and fortune, it is the new wife who reaps\r\nthe
    rewards. Many men feel similarly devalued by the Billionaire tale,\r\nbelieving
    it wrong for a woman to marry a man for his money.\r\n\r\nFor both men and women,
    what is being devalued in the Billionaire tale\r\nis love. Middle-class views
    of marriage hold that it ought to be a\r\nlifelong commitment. We are meant to
    love the other for who they are,\r\nnot for what they have. Our obligations in
    marriage are to fulfil our\r\npartnerâ\x80\x99s desire for love, not for more
    prosaic human needs and emotions\r\nsuch as money and power.\r\n\r\nBut how realistic
    is this view of marriage? Several recent studies\r\n(including Birrell and Rapson,
    on this page on 22 October) suggest that\r\ndeclines in marriage rates owe much
    to a drop-off of coupling among the\r\nworking classes. In the past, working-class
    women traded their work in\r\nthe home and raising of children in exchange for
    a share of their\r\npartnerâ\x80\x99s income. Yet rising unemployment has meant
    that many\r\nworking-class men can no longer keep the bargain.\r\n\r\nMany working-class
    men and women have seen marriage as a way of pooling\r\nscarce resources to achieve
    shared goals, such as children and economic\r\nsurvival. This isnâ\x80\x99t to
    say that the partners in these marriages donâ\x80\x99t\r\nlove each other, but
    that the basis of the marriage is not love, but\r\nreciprocal materially based
    obligation. Yet while few would judge such\r\nmarriages harshly, they feel free
    to condemn those between ageing\r\nbillionaires and their younger new wives. Surely
    these too are based on\r\nreciprocal obligation: for having to appear on the arms
    and in the beds\r\nof their rich husbands, the women may make use of his power
    and money.\r\n\r\nMaybe the Billionaire parable arouses our ire because we see
    that both\r\nparties are choosing a marriage based on reciprocal obligation, rather\r\nthan
    love. Those who opt for such a marriage, unlike the less well-off\r\nwho have
    little choice, are seen to degrade both themselves and the\r\nshared value of
    love.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps we resent the Billionaire tale because it reminds us that,\r\nfeminism
    notwithstanding, there has been little change in the social\r\nvalue men and women
    accord one another. Men still see women as current\r\nor former beauties, women
    still view men as walking wallets. And for\r\nmost of us, this value system marks
    us as inferior goods.\r\n\r\nThe Billionaire parable angers women by reminding
    them that their market\r\nvalue is in irreversible day-by-day decline. Men are
    incensed by being\r\nreminded that, as the real value of their pay packet is decaying,
    their\r\nprimary value to women is still as providers of money and status. In
    a\r\nworld where many of us will marry at least twice, reminders that our\r\nvalue
    as partners is ever declining may simply be unwelcome news."
