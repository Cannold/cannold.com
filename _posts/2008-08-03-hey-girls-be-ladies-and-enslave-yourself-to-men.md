    were attempting to\r\nhelp their daughters avoid through a good marriage was the
    short,\r\nbrutish and nasty life of a female peasant.\r\n\r\nNothing so noble
    is going on here. Instead the staff at Eggleston Hall\r\nare the unabashed handmaidens
    of the patriarchy, thieving the\r\nself-confidence and self-esteem that is essential
    to their young\r\nchargesâ\x80\x99 rebellion and using the feminine ideal as a
    cudgel to beat the\r\nbrash and non-conformist Ladettes into submission.\r\n\r\nThe
