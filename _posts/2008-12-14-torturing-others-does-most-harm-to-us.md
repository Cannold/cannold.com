    tortured by other nations).\r\n\r\nAnd the hits keep coming. As a radio documentary

    program follows the life and tragic death of American Adam Gray.\r\nGray served
    in Iraq and returned home with acute post-traumatic stress\r\ndisorder caused,
    according to his mother and the mates that served with\r\nhim in 68th Armor unit,
    by his inability to come to terms with what he\r\nhad done to the prisoners in
    his charge while he was there. While\r\ntraining for his next deployment, Gray
    attempted suicide and, three\r\nweeks later, was found dead in his barracks from
    what the military\r\ndescribes as an accidental drug overdose.\r\n\r\nThose who
    served with Gray have little doubt about what really killed\r\ntheir friend and
    what will be the death of them too, if they fail to\r\ntake necessary measures
    to tend their own psychological scars. Scars\r\ncaused by their inability to forgive
