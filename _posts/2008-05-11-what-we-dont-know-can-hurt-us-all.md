    have in common, and why should we give a rats?\r\n\r\nAnswer? All are essential

    depends.\r\n\r\nTake the de-funding of universities. The insistence on successive\r\nAustralian
    governments on underfunding higher education has forced some\r\nuniversity researchers
    to rely on Big Pharma dollars. But the data from\r\nindustry-funded research is
    flawed for reasons that include a preference\r\nfor evaluations of patient outcomes
    in the short-term (they cost less)\r\nand the reluctance of drug companies to
    publish results that show their\r\nproducts donâ\x80\x99t work at all, work less
    well than cheaper alternatives or\r\nhave worrying side effects.\r\n\r\nThis weekâ\x80\x99s
    police raid on the offices of the Sunday Times was another\r\nassault on our right
    to know. Designed to unearth the source of a story\r\nthat embarrassed the Carpenter
    government, it followed last yearâ\x80\x99s\r\nconviction of two journalists for
    contempt of court because they refused\r\nto reveal a source, and the handing
    of a suspended sentence to a public\r\nservant found guilty of leaking a report
    to the media that revealed\r\ndangerous security breeches at Sydney airport. Perhaps
    this is why\r\nReporters without Borders recently ranked Australia 35th, equal
    with\r\nBulgaria but behind Bolivia and South Korea, on the press freedom index.\r\n\r\nAttack
    on independent research, the free press and whistleblowers\r\nviolates the right
    of Australian citizens, and government\r\ndecision-makers, to access the independent,
    fulsome and reliable\r\ninformation they need to make good decisions for themselves,
    their\r\nfamilies and the nation. Yet too often, the public dismisses calls by\r\nacademics
    for independent funding, and the demands of journalists for\r\nshield and whistle-blower
    laws, as self-serving. Either that, or they\r\nyawn.\r\n\r\nBut we need to get
    it. We need to understand that however abstract,\r\nairy-fairy or hoity-toity
    concerns about independent research, press\r\nfreedom and whistleblowing sound,
    their absence is hurting each one of\r\nus: putting our health at risk; undermining
    our democracy.\r\n\r\nDid you know that the Australian government is now forced
    to rely on the\r\ndrug industryâ\x80\x99s clinical trials to decide what medicines
    to subsidise\r\nunder the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme? Think about it - your
    tax\r\ndollars currently subsidise medicines that may be unnecessary,\r\nineffective
    or even dangerous.\r\n\r\nDid you realize that when you open the newspaper each
    day there are\r\nstories you wonâ\x80\x99t see because your friends, neighbours
    or colleagues\r\ndecided not to leak the information that would have informed
    you of a\r\ndangerous incompetence or venal fraud in some key institution? That
    at\r\nleast one of the reasons they may have kept mum was a fear - in the\r\nabsence
    of comprehensive national whistleblower legislation - of being\r\npublicly vilified,
    sacked or taken to court?\r\n\r\nHow can we keep our commercial and public sectors
    free of corruption, if\r\ndecision-makers know their immorality and errors will
    go with them to\r\ntheir graves? Corrupt public institutions strike at the heart
    of\r\ndemocracy itself, by undermining the rule of law, and replacing it with\r\nthe
    rule of powerful men, while a free press is essential to a\r\nfunctioning democracy..\r\n\r\nSo
    next time you hear some academic thumping their chest about a loss of\r\nfunding,
    or a journalist bemoaning some restrictive government law or\r\npractice, donâ\x80\x99t
    tune out. What we donâ\x80\x99t know can hurt us all."
