    selective classes for academically gifted students.\r\n\r\nFor those who canâ\x80\x99t
    afford private school fees, or the costs of a home\r\nin an area blessed with
    a first-rate public high school, entry to one of\r\nthese selective schools may
    be their high-achieving childâ\x80\x99s only chance\r\nof getting the education
    she needs.\r\n\r\nSo what if you have enough money to send your child to a private
    school\r\nthat is both able and willing to challenge your gifted child? Is it\r\nright
    for you to send your child to a selective school, if she gets in?\r\n\r\nThis
    dilemma is all too real. Recently, I read of a couple who were\r\nfrank about
    their capacity to afford a top private education for their\r\nson, but moved into
    the zone of the stateâ\x80\x99s top public school so they\r\ncould renovate their
    house, build a swimming pool and avoid becoming\r\nworkforce slaves so they could
    spend more time with their kids.\r\n\r\nAre such choices right? Fair? Does the
    mere asking of such questions -\r\nguaranteed to foster a fractious and divisive
    debate about personal\r\nethics - signal the success of State and Federal government
    strategy to\r\nwedge the community on the schools issue to distract from their
    woeful\r\nneglect of public education and its tragic consequence: the failure
    to\r\nprovide every child with local public schools able to deliver the\r\neducation
    they need and deserve?\r\n\r\nI think the latter. OK, itâ\x80\x99s true. I feel
    uncomfortable about parents\r\nchoosing to renovate and build a pool instead of
    paying private school\r\nfees, but have sympathy for those wishing to work less
    and spend more\r\ntime with their kids. And I canâ\x80\x99t help but admire the
    decision of a now\r\nwealthy friend from a middle-class background not to sit
    his bright\r\nchild for the entry test for the selective high school he credits
    with\r\nhis success because he wants the place to go to a child in need.\r\n\r\nBut
    these are my values, and yours may be different. And the truth is\r\nthat pondering
    what individuals of conscience do in unconscionable\r\nsituations is not the best
    way to solve this countryâ\x80\x99s neglect of our\r\nchildrenâ\x80\x99s educational
    needs.\r\n\r\nInstead, what we need is a paradigm shift. Away from a view of children\r\nas
    private possessions (the benefits of which reside solely with their\r\nparents)
    and towards one that recognizes them as a public good. Viewed\r\nthis way, the
    moral problem shifts away from the adequacy of particular\r\nparentsâ\x80\x99
    sacrifice, and towards the moral obligations of employers and\r\ngovernments (which
    regularly wax eloquent about the need for couples to\r\nreproduce early and often)
    to invest in the education of this countryâ\x80\x99s\r\nfuture citizens and workforce.\r\n\r\nAnd
    the investment currently being made is inadequate, with the Federal\r\nGovernmentâ\x80\x99s
    own ministerial taskforce making clear that without $2.9\r\nbillion more each
    year, public schools will be unable to meet what\r\nEducation Ministers of all
    State, Territory and Commonwealth governments\r\nagreed were the very goals of
    schooling in the 21st century.\r\n\r\nI think itâ\x80\x99s true to say that if
    the school best placed to meet our\r\nchildâ\x80\x99s academic needs was around
    the corner and free, most of us would\r\nsend our child there.\r\n\r\nThis makes
    the key moral question: why canâ\x80\x99t most of us say this about\r\nour local
    schools, and what - as a nation - do we intend to do about it?"
