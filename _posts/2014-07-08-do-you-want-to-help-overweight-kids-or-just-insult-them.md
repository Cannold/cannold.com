  content: "*We need a positive message to give children the gift of good health,
    writes Leslie Cannold.*\r\n\r\nFAT camps, prohibitions on junk food advertising,
    bans on sugary drinks in school canteens, Medicare subsidies for private weight-loss
    programs, chair-free classrooms, food pyramids. School weigh-ins, public service
    announcements telling kids to take more exercise, public hospital weight management
    clinics for the young. Bulging childhood waistlines as risk factors for diabetes,
    heart disease, escalating health care costs and social exclusion. Childhood obesity
    as lifestyle choice, disease, biological destiny or the result of parental ignorance,
    sloth or permissiveness. And in 2006, a three-fold increase in the number of Melbourne
    children â\x80\x94 some as young as 10 â\x80\x94 admitted to hospital with eating
    disorders resulting from their morbid fear of fat.\r\n\r\nAnd of winding up unloveable
    and unloved?\r\n\r\nSurely, I am not the only person who has noticed that not
    only has our current approach to the \"youth obesity epidemic\" been ineffective
    in reducing our children's collective girth, but also violates the first-order
    principle of medical ethics that above all, we must do no harm.\r\n\r\nHow does
    calling our kids tubby harm them? These days everyone knows that \"fat\" is more
    than a physical description of body mass, but a negative assessment of physical
    attractiveness and moral worth. Despite protests outside the White House by overweight
    Americans holding placards insisting that \"fat is not a four-letter word\", children
    today are well aware of the connection in the popular mind between the generously
    waisted and the indiscreet, the lazy, the pitiful, the asexual and the wildly
    out of control. Cultural researchers say it is no coincidence that in times of
    sexual permissiveness and consumerist plenty, thinness is idealised for representing
    virtue, self-denial and self-control.\r\n\r\nChildren's bodies change rapidly
    right up to their early 20s, with the pre-teen and teen years critical moments
    for the development of self-identity and self-esteem. It's hard to imagine a worse
    time for children to be told their developing bodies are an eyesore and evidence
    of poor moral character.\r\n\r\nJust as damning is the inevitable failure of any
    behavioural-change approach obsessed with cataloguing and stamping out fat. Behavioural
    change relies on our feeling good about ourselves, something just as true for
    children as for adults. The higher the temperature surrounding the moral panic,
    the worse overweight children are likely to feel about themselves, and the less
    likely they are to feel worthy of their own efforts to change.\r\n\r\nThis counterproductive
    behavioural circularity that begins with low self-esteem is familiar to addiction
    counsellors, and is no less evident â\x80\x94 should we care to listen â\x80\x94
    in the testimony of the overweight. \"You get in a vicious circle about losing
    weight,\" Diane O'Mara told The Age earlier this year. \"You eat the wrong thing,
    then you feel bad, then you eat more.\" The nexus between harsh social judgements
    of the obese, their low self-esteem and consequent inability to lose weight is
    summed up by American professor and author Peter Stearns. \"If you fail to lose
    weight, you are demonstrating you're a bad person. It's a big burden. Faced with
    this additional pressure, you are even more likely to say 'The hell with it! I'm
    going to get ice-cream. I am such a bad person I need to solace myself.' \"\r\n\r\nOf
    course, the poor correlation between negative self-esteem and successful weight
    loss serves the diet industry. Studies suggest that only when consumers hate their
    overweight bodies, and believe them unattractive, are they motivated to dig deep
    for the diet products and services worth more than $500 million a year in Australia.
    As well, the now accepted paradox that dieting makes you fat ensures that the
    vast majority of consumers will \"fail\" and â\x80\x94 dragging their bedraggled
    self-esteem behind them â\x80\x94 return for further expensive but ineffective
    \"therapy\".\r\n\r\nBut if insults are counter-productive and hand-wringing is
    out, what should we be doing? In general terms, we need to stop talking about
    the depravity of fat, and focus instead on the desirability of good health. Focusing
    on obesity inevitably leads to \"don't\" and \"shouldn't\" messages that problematically
    posit guilt and counterproductively idealise penitent self-denial. In contrast,
    promoting good health lends itself to messages of \"do\" (eat healthy foods) and
    \"dessert\" (as in, you deserve it) that connect self-nurture with the bodily
    well-being necessary to enjoy the good things in life.\r\n\r\nPositive messages
    are also more likely to be effective in promoting behavioural change, and insofar
    as they focus more on the importance of staying active rather than on what we
    eat, may even be more consistent with the medical evidence. Paul Campos, professor
    of law at the University of Colorado and author of The Obesity Myth argues that
    activity is a better predictor of health than weight and that, \"There is no good
    evidence that significant long-term weight loss is beneficial to health\".\r\n\r\nWe
    need to speak to our children, and about them, in ways that make our love for
    them, and approval of the people they are becoming, crystal clear. Teaching them
    how to nurture themselves by eating healthy food and participating in physical
    activity they enjoy is the most ethical and effective way for us as parents, and
    as a society, to offer them the gift of good health.\r\n\r\nThis piece was quoted
