    start\r\nwagging. Our rate is too high, the experts say, partly because some\r\nmothers
    are too posh to push.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Australiaâ\x80\x99s caesarean rate
    is high and, until recently,\r\nclimbing. In 1997, 20 per cent of women gave birth
    by caesarean. By\r\n2007, the rate had climbed to 31 per cent, where it remains.
    This is at\r\nleast double the 10 to 15 per cent proportion recommended by the
    World\r\nHealth Organisation.\r\n\r\nBut that ideal is 25 years out of date. Britainâ\x80\x99s
    Parliamentary Office\r\nof Science and Technology says that if it repeated the
    exercise used to\r\narrive at the initial figures, it would come up with a â\x80\x9Crather
    higher\r\nrangeâ\x80\x9D. This is because the recommendation was derived from
    caesarean\r\nfigures in countries that had the lowest mortality rates at the time\r\nand,
    today, few countries have caesarean rates below 15 per cent.\r\n\r\nCaesarean
    rates follow the money. In Brazil, caesarean rates in the\r\nprivate sector are
    80 per cent. In Australia, women giving birth in\r\nprivate hospitals have a caesarean
    rate of 41 per cent, compared to 28\r\nper cent for those in the public system.\r\n\r\nStaff
    attitudes and institutional culture with regard to womenâ\x80\x99s choice\r\nalso
    play a part. In one Australian study, 62 per cent of women having a\r\ncaesarean
    in a private hospital said their healthcare provider had\r\nrecommended it. This
    contrasted with the 40 per cent in the public\r\nsector.\r\n\r\nA comparison of
    two British hospitals by the Parliamentary Office of\r\nScience and Technology
    found that caesarean rates were lower in the\r\ninstitution where women lacked
    the â\x80\x9Cfreedomâ\x80\x9D to â\x80\x9Cexpress a preference\r\nfor caesarean
    sectionâ\x80\x9D and higher where women were â\x80\x9Cgiven information\r\nabout
    the known relative risks of [caesarean] and vaginal birthâ\x80\x9Dand\r\nallowed
    to make â\x80¦ the final choice\".\r\n\r\nSuch findings should sound alarm bells
    to anyone interested in the right\r\nof women to make free and self-directed choices
    about their medical\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nThe â\x80\x9Ctoo posh to pushâ\x80\x9D claim
    is mostly myth. Anecdotal evidence from\r\nBritain suggests that some women request
    caesareans because they fear\r\nthe pain of labour. We know from Australian and
    overseas data that most\r\nwomen want to have their baby the old-fashioned way.
    Guesstimates of\r\nthose without medical indicators who choose caesarean are between
    3 and\r\n15 per cent. This fits with the observation of the International\r\nFederation
    of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) that most women will act\r\nto improve their
    chance of having a normal birth and healthy baby if\r\nthey have access to the
    necessary information and support. In other\r\nwords, most pregnant women will
    choose the option medical staff tell\r\nthem is in their and their foetusâ\x80\x99s
    best interest.\r\n\r\nBut what if they donâ\x80\x99t? There is no hard evidence
    on the relative risks\r\nand benefits of caesarean delivery for non-medical reasons
    compared with\r\nvaginal delivery. This makes emphatic assertions by health experts
    that\r\nvaginal birth is safer than elective caesarean for low-risk pregnant\r\nwomen
    worth less than a hill of beans.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of definitive data, there
    are arguments both ways. One\r\nstudy found 31 per cent of female obstetricians
    would chose a caesarean\r\nover vaginal delivery because of risks of stress incontinence,
    anal\r\nsphincter damage and compromised sexual function following vaginal\r\ndelivery.\r\n\r\nEven
    if medicos had the evidence on which to base an agreed\r\nrecommendation about
    elective caesarean, women would still have the\r\nright to decide differently.
    The freedom to review and evaluate the\r\nrisk/benefit profile of all available
    medical options and to make a\r\ndecision based on oneâ\x80\x99s own needs and
    values is what informed choice is\r\nall about.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that
    - short of engaging in self or child abuse -\r\nwomen do not have to prove to
    health professionals that their healthcare\r\nchoices are good or worthy ones
    to have the right to decide. This is as\r\ntrue about their choice of delivery
    method as it is about how they look\r\nafter themselves while pregnant, and how
    they mother once the baby is\r\nborn.\r\n\r\nPregnant women can choose a glass
    of wine with dinner, to have their\r\nbaby by caesarean and to feed by bottle
    instead of breast. As long as\r\nthey are making the decision freely, and on the
    basis of a substantial\r\nunderstanding of the issues, the choice belongs to them."

--- "Mention Australiaâ\x80\x99s caesarean section rate and collective tongues start\r\nwagging.
