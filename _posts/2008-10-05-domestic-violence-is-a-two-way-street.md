    they had the answer: single sex\r\naccommodation. The only problem was that the
    actual and threatened\r\nassaults the young women told me about were not just
    from angry young\r\nmen, but hardened young women whoâ\x80\x99d been on the streets
    for years. Over\r\nmany months I dutifully reported to my superiors what the young
    women\r\ntold me: that they were as afraid of assaults from their own sex as from\r\nthe
    opposite one, but my findings were rejected as lies and distraction.\r\nThe earth

    a broken rib. He was clearly upset and I was\r\n\\\\unsure what to say. So unsure
