    recently about the\r\ncontinuing crisis: â\x80\x9CThis [is] not primarily a story
    of wayward priests\r\nbut of an uncannily consistent pattern by individual bishops.

    revile it most. A\r\nformer staffer for federal and state Labor ministers has
    given an\r\ninsiderâ\x80\x99s account - replete with shadowy fund-raising events
    and\r\nnon-fee-paying members recruited en masse - of how factional bosses\r\ndetermine
    who will gain preselection in safe Labor seats.\r\n\r\nThe whistleblowerâ\x80\x99s
    motives may not be pure (he only came forward after\r\npayment for his branch-stacking

    persistent refusal to undertake the systemic\r\nchange its own experts said was
    necessary to fix the problem. As an\r\neditorial in *The Age* put it: â\x80\x9CThe
    cancerous effects on a party that\r\nbreaks its own rules and marginalises members
    were spelt out in 2002 by\r\nBob Hawke and Neville Wran but the branch stacking
    continued apace.\r\nDespite two damning independent reports last year on the Brimbank\r\nCouncil
    scandal in Victoria, the ALPâ\x80\x99s own internal review found little\r\nof
    concern.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nWhat should we do? First, admit that corruption is like
    mosquitoes near\r\na swamp - inevitable. Human nature is flawed and, left untutored
    or\r\nunattended, some people will ride roughshod over the rules and customs\r\nthat
    keep the rest of us in check. They will do so to enhance their own\r\npower, wealth
    or influence and with scant regard to how their actions\r\naffect others or the
    organisations they claim to serve.\r\n\r\nTo stop them hurting others and destroying
    the fabric of civil society,\r\nwe must build institutions that hope for the best
    but can weather the\r\nworst. Institutions armed with systems to minimise, detect
    and expose\r\nmalfeasance by checking power and compelling transparency and\r\naccountability.
    Such systems must be regularly reviewed and updated, so\r\njust as the rogues
    learn them, the rules that govern play change.\r\n\r\nOne final observation. Corruption
    is a culture. It thrives on\r\ninsularity. I know someone who defends political
    corruption on grounds\r\nthat the efficiencies are necessary and the ends justify
