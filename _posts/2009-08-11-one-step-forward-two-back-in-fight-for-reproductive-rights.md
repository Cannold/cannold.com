    weekâ\x80\x99s announcement by Marie Stopes International that clients of\r\nits
    clinics in Victoria, NSW, Queensland, the ACT and Western Australia\r\ncan now
    terminate pregnancies at less than nine weeks using RU486 is one\r\nmore step
    in Australian womenâ\x80\x99s struggle for full equality and\r\nreproductive rights.\r\n\r\nRU486
    has had a chequered history in this country. For many years it was\r\neffectively
    banned as a result of a deal brokered by both major parties\r\nto secure former
    senator Brian Harradineâ\x80\x99s vote to sell Telstra. Only in\r\n2006, as a
    result of the efforts of a cross-party group of female\r\nsenators was the law
    changed, allowing RU486 to be regulated like all\r\nother drugs.\r\n\r\nA pharmaceutical
    company will soon apply for and be granted a general\r\nlicence to import and
    market the drug. Medicos will finally be able to\r\ndispense the drug like all
    others, by prescription and on the basis of\r\npatient need. But just as one door
    opens, several others threaten to\r\nslam shut.\r\n\r\nThe most worrying development
    is in Queensland, where a teenage girl is\r\nbeing prosecuted for having an abortion.
    Yes, you heard right. Next\r\nmonth Tegan Leach, 19, will return to court with
    her boyfriend to defend\r\ncharges that he gave her RU486, and she used it, to
    abort an unwanted\r\npregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe couple seem certain to be found guilty.
    Abortion is in the criminal\r\ncode in Queensland, and the facts of the case suggest
    the young woman\r\nand her boyfriend did the â\x80\x9Ccrimeâ\x80\x9D. That is,
    having discovered they were\r\npregnant, and judging themselves too young to be
    parents, they obtained\r\nRU486 with the intention of causing her to miscarry.\r\n\r\nYou
    might think that in the face of this impending travesty pro-choice\r\nPremier
    Anna Bligh would be looking for ways to help. First and\r\nforemost, you might
    think that Bligh would be preparing a bill to\r\npresent to Parliament to reform
    an antiquated law that makes one of the\r\nsafest and most common medical procedures
    a felony.\r\n\r\nYou would be wrong. Instead, in a staggering display of ignorance
    and\r\nobfuscation, Bligh has done her damndest to convince Queenslanders that\r\nLeachâ\x80\x99s
    situation is anomalous. Something to do with the fact that the\r\ndrug she took,
    RU486, was not prescribed by a doctor or isnâ\x80\x99t approved\r\nfor general
    use. In reply to the truth - that what has happened to the\r\nteenager could happen
    to any Queensland man, woman or medico involved\r\nwith abortion as long as the
    procedure remains a crime - she has burbled\r\nabout the need for a private memberâ\x80\x99s
    bill to come before parliament for\r\nthe issue to be decided.\r\n\r\nBligh, and
    the Government she leads, could move to change the law\r\ntomorrow and should,
    given that removing abortion from the Crimes Act is\r\nLabor Party policy and
    Bligh made numerous backroom promises before the\r\nmost recent election that
    she would reform the law if she won.\r\nQueensland Labor: compromised one day,
    craven the next. One wonders\r\nexactly what has to happen to women in Queensland
    before their\r\npoliticians act to represent them.\r\n\r\nLuckily for women in
    Victoria, political integrity and guts are more\r\nplentiful at Spring Street.
    We are going to need them. After successful\r\nreform of Victoriaâ\x80\x99s abortion
    law last year - reform that means no\r\nVictorian teenager will ever have to endure
    what Tegan Leach is going\r\nthrough - pro-life forces are up in arms.\r\n\r\nAt
    a recent conference in Melbourne, on the subject of conscience no\r\nless, pro-life
    doctors lambasted Victoriaâ\x80\x99s Abortion Law Reform Act for\r\nrequiring
    them to perform an abortion in an emergency. Instead they seem\r\nto feel they
    have a right to let their female patients die. They plan to\r\ntake a test case
    to court.\r\n\r\nTheir chances of winning are nearly zero. Even the most restrictive\r\ndefinition
    of a medical professionalâ\x80\x99s duty of care requires assistance\r\nto be
    rendered in an emergency.\r\n\r\nBut truckloads of taxpayer resources will be
    consumed in defending the\r\ncase through the assertion, I would assume, that\r\n\r\nin
    a liberal, plural democracy, women have rights, too. Namely, a right\r\nto equality
    before the law and to be treated as more than human\r\nincubators whose lives
    are worth little, or nothing at all."
