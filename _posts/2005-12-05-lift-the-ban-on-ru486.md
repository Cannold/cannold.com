    the giving spirit might have affected the Prime Minister when it\r\ncame to the
    abortion drug RU 486 have found their stockings sadly empty.\r\nOn Tuesday, the
    Prime Minister emerged from a Liberal party room meeting\r\nto inform the media
    that the vote expected by the end of next week was\r\ncancelled. The Coalitionâ\x80\x99s
    pre-Christmas legislative agenda was crowded\r\nwith issues far more important
    than womenâ\x80\x99s health. Those hoping to find\r\nout whether Australian patients
    will finally get access to a\r\npharmaceutical that doesnâ\x80\x99t just terminate
    very early pregnancies, but\r\nis used in the treatment of breast cancer and endometriosis,
    would just\r\nhave to wait.\r\n\r\nBut the truth is that if the PM had strongly
    defined what the vote was\r\nreally about - and insisted the Coalition take a
    principled stand on the\r\nissue - the vote could have been wrapped up in less
    than an hour. The\r\nvote was never about abortion, or even the safety or effectiveness
    of RU\r\n486. It was about who should decide if RU 486 is safe and effective\r\nenough
    to be marketed in Australia: the Health Minister or the\r\nTherapeutics Goods
    Administration. This no-brainer of a question is\r\nessentially one about good
    governance. How worrying that the Prime\r\nMinister determined his colleagues
    needed the entire holiday period to\r\nconsider their answer, and a conscience
    vote on the issue when they\r\nreturn to work 2006.\r\n\r\nSo how are events likely
    to play out next year? John Howard has promised\r\na conscience vote, but whether
    it will take place on a Democrats\r\namendment to the Therapeutic Goods Act (TGA),
    or a Private Memberâ\x80\x99s Bill\r\nfacilitated by the Government, no one can
    say. All power lies with the\r\nPrime Minister. If the Government moves its own
    amendments to the TGA,\r\nthis will give the Democrats the chance to initiate
    a vote on the ban.\r\nAlternately, the Government can facilitate a Private Memberâ\x80\x99s
    bill\r\nmooting the necessary changes to the TGA.\r\n\r\nA private memberâ\x80\x99s
    bill in the new year carries significant risks for\r\nsupporters of womenâ\x80\x99s
    health and freedom. Having successfully delayed\r\nthe vote, the large coterie
    of anti-choice government ministers who\r\nsurround the Prime Minister may now
    be hoping to convince him that they\r\nneed a private memberâ\x80\x99s bill, too.
    Say, one that bans Medicare funding\r\nfor abortion, or mandates that women â\x80\x9Ccool
    offâ\x80\x9D for 2 days before being\r\neligible to claim the abortion rebate.
    If such proposals sound extreme\r\nor unlikely, guess again. Both have been floated
    in the last few years\r\nby prominent members of the Coalition government, and
    have the support\r\nof key members of the Labor party.\r\n\r\nSupporters of the
    ban are also pushing the PM to set up an inquiry into\r\nthe drugâ\x80\x99s safety.
    Hmmm, good idea. What about letting the TGA do it?\r\nIndeed, a research note
    published this week by the federal parliamentary\r\nlibrary service, which provides
    neutral information, analysis and advice\r\nto MPs, points out that the TGA is
    precisely the right agency to\r\nundertake such an evaluation as it is explicitly
    charged with evaluating\r\nand managing the risks associated with pharmaceuticals.
    The noteâ\x80\x99s\r\nauthor points out that â\x80\x9CThe TGA is regarded by the
    government as being\r\nqualified to manage the risks associated with any therapeutic
    good that\r\nis used (or proposed for use) in Australiaâ\x80¦[Why shouldnâ\x80\x99t
    one]\r\nreasonably assume that it is also qualified to manage the risks\r\nassociated
    with abortifacients such as RU486â\x80\x9D?\r\n\r\nSo what can those with a penchant
    for good governance and a distaste for\r\npolitical interference into the private
    decisions citizens make about\r\ntheir lives and health do to restore the integrity
    of the TGAâ\x80\x99s drug\r\nevaluation framework and to lift the ban on RU486?\r\n\r\nThe
    simple answer is to make more noise. The Governmentâ\x80\x99s TGA bill\r\nremains
    on their legislative agenda for this parliamentary session. The\r\nPrime Minister
    must be urged to bring the bill on and to allow a vote on\r\nthe Democratâ\x80\x99s
    amendment before the holiday break. And if a Private\r\nMemberâ\x80\x99s bill
    early next year is the best he can do, the unfairness of\r\nany tit-for-tat offerings
    to supporters of the ban must be made clear..\r\n\r\nHaving achieved their aim
    of delaying the bill, theyâ\x80\x99ve had their\r\nChristmas present already."
