    worked as a\r\njournalist and political press secretary before leading the successful\r\ncampaign
    against an Australian republic. He is associated with groups\r\nthat favour censorship
    but are opposed to legal abortion, dying with\r\ndignity, stem-cell research and
    gay rights. These include the National\r\nCivic Council, the Lyons Forum, the
    Endeavour Forum and the Australian\r\nChristian Lobby.\r\n\r\nAbbott recently
    described Aboriginal welcome to country ceremonies as a\r\nâ\x80\x9Cgenuflection
    to political correctnessâ\x80\x9D and â\x80\x9Cout-of-place tokenism.â\x80\x9D\r\nHowever,

    and policies on abortion renewed\r\nnational debate about the issue. He described

    as a â\x80\x9Cnational\r\ntragedyâ\x80\x9D that left a â\x80\x9Clegacy of unutterable
    shame.â\x80\x9D He said there was â\x80\x9Ca\r\nbizarre double standardâ\x80¦where
    someone who kills a pregnant womanâ\x80\x99s baby\r\nis guilty of murder but a
    woman who aborts an unborn baby is simply\r\nexercising choice.â\x80\x9D The figure
