    by Helen Garner. Carlton, Melbourne University Press, 2006. 214\r\npages. ISBN:
    0~~522~~85231â\x80\x939\r\n\r\nFor some, but perhaps not enough of us, time and
    people divide into two\r\ncategories: the time before abortion laws were liberalised,
    and the time\r\nafter; those who remember what it was like prior to decriminalisation,\r\nand
    those who donâ\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nLost is about the time before, written for those
    who came after, or who\r\nwish to pay tribute to the women they knew who lived
    through those\r\nterrible before-times by bearing witness to their stories. It
    is edited\r\nand introduced by Dr Jo Wainer whose own life, according to a somewhat\r\ndifferent
    chronology, also divides into before and after. Her first\r\n20-odd years before
    she became the inaugural treasurer of the Abortion\r\nLaw Reform Association in
    1967, and all thatâ\x80\x99s come after in which, as\r\nan activist, service-provider
    and now academic, she has dedicated to the\r\nâ\x80\x9Ctask of understanding the
    political, legal, religious, social and\r\nmedical issuesâ\x80¦buried in that
    one word - abortion.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nWainer and writer Helen Garner, who authors
    a short foreword to the\r\ncollection, vividly describe the stifling, puritan
    backdrop of 1950s\r\nMelbourne against which the dramas of individual women play
    out. But it\r\nis Lostâ\x80\x99s collection of 21 first-hand accounts by aborting
    women - some\r\nyoung, some old, nearly all poor - that captivate both attention
    and\r\nheart. Stories, as Garner notes, that even without descriptions of the\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99s
    appearance or the way her voice sounds and body moves as she\r\ntalks, still contain
    â\x80\x9Cmatter enough for a novelâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nAmy waited until marriage
    to have sex, only to discover sheâ\x80\x99d prefer to\r\nbake a â\x80\x9Clovely
    sponge cakeâ\x80\x9D than have intercourse with her violent\r\nalcoholic husband.
    She had several children in quick succession before -\r\nunable to find effective
    contraception or to resist her husbandâ\x80\x99s\r\nattention - she endured several
    anaesthetic-free curettes in a\r\nstrangerâ\x80\x99s lounge room.\r\n\r\n21-year
    old Belinda was denied the Pill by a doctor with a framed\r\npicture of Mother
    Mary on his desk, and was lectured for half an hour on\r\nthe mortal sin of single
    women using contraception. When she became\r\npregnant, she wanted to continue,
    but her boyfriend refused to support\r\nher. To get a safe abortion at 20 weeks
    she had to get a psychiatrist to\r\nwrite a letter - the existence of which on
    her medical files spooked her\r\nfor years afterwards - saying sheâ\x80\x99d be
    an unfit mother.\r\n\r\nSixteen year old Beverlyâ\x80\x99s instructions from the
    backyarder who\r\nconsented to terminate her were as follows: â\x80\x9CCome here
    Thursday morning\r\nwith $600, bring a packet of pads, a packet of Panadol and
    donâ\x80\x99t expect\r\nto go home until Friday nightâ\x80\x9D. When she hesitated
    before spreading her\r\nlegs on the manâ\x80\x99s kitchen table, he admonishes:
    â\x80\x9CDonâ\x80\x99t worry about your\r\npride and dignity now, girl. You lost
    that the day you got yourself into\r\nthis messâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nAnd on it goes.
    Bashed women. Scared women. Women so ignorant of the\r\nrudiments of sex they
    donâ\x80\x99t even realise theyâ\x80\x99re pregnant until in\r\nlabour and, even
    then, have little idea from what orfice the baby will\r\nemerge. Women who accepted
    the contempt and even sexual violence of\r\nabortion providers or the doctors
    they relied on for referrals to safer\r\npractitioners as apt punishment for the
    sexual â\x80\x9Csinsâ\x80\x9D that led to the\r\nabortion, or the abortion itself.
    And women who, inexplicably given the\r\ntone and tenor of the times, reject all
    efforts to make them feel like\r\ndirt: â\x80\x9CMind your own business and donâ\x80\x99t
    bother sending me a bill!â\x80\x9D\r\nBelinda told the Mother Mary doctor before
    slamming the door behind her.\r\nSays Beverly indignantly of her first interview
    with the backyard\r\nprovider: â\x80\x9CHe didnâ\x80\x99t even ask my nameâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nBut
    while it is each storyâ\x80\x99s particularity that rivets, it was the\r\ncommon
    elements of womenâ\x80\x99s stories - the secrecy, the exploitation, the\r\nviolence,
    the suffering, the death - that gave them political charge. Jo\r\nand Bert Wainer
    knew this, and while Bert solicited the stories in Lost\r\nin 1985 in a â\x80\x9Clest
    we forgetâ\x80\x9D spirit, he had used newspaper ads to urge\r\nwomen to speak
    their truths before, and had used the information he\r\nelicited to raise awareness
    of the costs to women and to society -\r\nthrough the flowering of police corruption
    - of prohibition. Womenâ\x80\x99s\r\nstories were at the heart of the Wainersâ\x80\x99
    agitation for a Royal\r\nCommission into police corruption, and their pursuit
    of test cases that\r\nestablished the reach of the common law ruling on which
    Victorian women\r\nstill rely for safe, legal services.\r\n\r\nBefore turning
    the first page of Lost, I hesitated. However worthy the\r\naim, I knew enough
    about the pre-legalisation era to know I was standing\r\non the threshold of a
    whole world of pain. But from Garnerâ\x80\x99s opening\r\nwords - â\x80\x9CItâ\x80\x99s
    an awe-inspiring force, the iron determination of a woman\r\nwho refuses to bear
    a child that she knows she cannot motherâ\x80\x9D - I was\r\nhooked. Unable to
    put the book down, I read straight through to the end.\r\n\r\nHow could I have
    forgotten the compelling privilege of being invited\r\ninto the most painful and
    intimate corners of other peopleâ\x80\x99s lives? In\r\nparticular, I felt touched
    by the way in which womenâ\x80\x99s fears, health and\r\nlives were unquestionably
    at the centre of the moral Rubicon of\r\npre~~1980s abortion politics. Then, like
    now, the fetus was never far\r\nfrom womenâ\x80\x99s minds: its potential to be
    their helpless, demanding and\r\ndesperately-loved baby the impetus for the abortion
    in the first place.\r\nBut unlike today, where women must battle to be seen and
    heard in the\r\npublic debate against chaste, silhouetted images of fetuses set
    off in\r\nsurrounds reminiscent of space capsules, the womb was opaque. Women\r\ndecided
    what doctors, husbands and others would know of the developing\r\nlife inside,
    and it was their experience of gestation and impeding\r\nmotherhood~~ wonder-filled
    or terrifying, desired or unwanted - that\r\nmediated its relationship with others.\r\n\r\nIndeed,
    at the heart of the contemporary abortion debate is one about\r\nthe moral frame.
    Are women at the centre of the story; those who should\r\nrightly evoke our compassion
    and hold the trumping rights, or is it\r\nfetuses? Are women autonomous choosers
    of abortion or duped and bereaved\r\nvictims of it?\r\n\r\nI feel confident about
    what the Wainers, and the women of Lost, would\r\nsay."
