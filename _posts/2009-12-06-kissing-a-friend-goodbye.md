    I use the term â\x80\x9Cfriendâ\x80\x9D advisedly here because friendship is what\r\nthis
    story is all about.\r\n\r\nEllen was asked by her school chum Cassandra to babysit
    her child so\r\nthat Cassandra could nip off to a networking work function. She
    said she\r\nwould be back no later than 4pm. In the event, Cassandra didnâ\x80\x99t
    turn up\r\nuntil near midnight, having sent Ellen just one text message advising
    of\r\nher changed plans. Cassandraâ\x80\x99s little boy missed Mummy, forcing
    Ellen to\r\nboth manage and â\x80\x9Ccover upâ\x80\x9D for what she felt was a
    serious case of bad\r\nmothering.\r\n\r\nWhen Ellen asked for the favour to be
    returned in kind, Cassandra\r\nagreed, then welshed on the deal. Ellen arrived
    to find her little girl\r\nin the care of Cassandraâ\x80\x99s hubby, when Ellen
    had specifically requested\r\nthat the child be minded by Cassandra herself. â\x80\x9CThatâ\x80\x99s
    it,â\x80\x9D Ellen\r\nshouted at her old friend. â\x80\x9CYou and I are through!â\x80\x9D
    And so things have\r\nstood, though now Ellen has doubts. Was she too hasty? Harsh?
    Or was she\r\nright to have taken a stand?\r\n\r\nEnding a long-standing friendship
    is hard to do. The reason why lies at\r\nthe heart of what we understand friendship
    to be - a do-or-die,\r\nthrough-thick-and-thin pledge to another person. As our
    faith in the\r\nperpetual nature of romantic partnerships declines, a forever
    dedication\r\nto our mates has arisen to take its place.\r\n\r\nBut if fidelity
    is part of the modern definition of friendship, then\r\ndumping a friend can be
    seen to reflect poorly not just on the\r\nCassandras of the world but the Ellens,
    too. I understand how we got to\r\na place where preserving old friendships feels
    like a moral duty. We got\r\nthere because however much we exalt the choice and
    contingency that\r\ndefines modern romantic relationships (we marry for love and,
    if\r\ndissatisfied with our choice, pull the plug and try again), it also\r\nmakes
    us nervous.\r\n\r\nIn the old days, everything was decided for us - work, who
    we would\r\nmarry, the community in which weâ\x80\x99d come of age, raise children
    and die.\r\nGossip was rife, jobs were for life and divorce as rare as the social\r\nisolation
    that these days can be the consequence of constant job, house\r\nand partner upgrades.\r\n\r\nInventing
    your life day after day offers significant upsides (doing what\r\nyou want, where
    you want and with whom you want) but also downside risks\r\n(wrong choices can
    leave you unemployable, isolated and alone). Into the\r\nbreach comes an increasingly
    non-contingent definition of friend. A\r\nperson to whom one owes a secure loyalty,
    not one contingent on the\r\nfailure of someone smarter, richer or funnier to
    come along.\r\n\r\nDespite this, there are circumstances where we are right to
    kiss an old\r\nfriend goodbye. If a friend abuses your trust and takes advantage
    of\r\nyou, they are not really a friend. Loyalty without limits sets the stage\r\nfor
    abuse and becomes a destructive feature of a personâ\x80\x99s moral psyche,\r\nnot
    a virtuous one. Ellen needs to set limits on the friendship and\r\nexplain these
    to Cassandra, as well as the consequences of their being\r\noverstepped. Cassandraâ\x80\x99s
    response will speak volumes about the value she\r\nputs on the friendship."
