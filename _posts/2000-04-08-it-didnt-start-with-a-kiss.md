    a perfect\r\ntwosome, the ultimate love? In his construction of the relationship\r\nbetween
    Gen-X FBI agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder, the Australian-born\r\ncreator of
    The X-Files, Chris Carter, has taken a leaf from the\r\nVictorian era, and added
    a distinctive 21st-century twist.\r\n\r\nSince the start of The X-Files, Carter
    has insisted there would be no\r\nshagging between the two agents, despite studio
    pressure for what he\r\nderisively refers to as a \\`\\`David and Maddyâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99
    thing. Carterâ\x80\x99s reason?\r\nHe wanted their relationship to be \\`\\`more
    interestingâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 than that.\r\n\r\nBut what could be more interesting
    than shagging? Throughout the early\r\ndays of the series, before all my energy
    went into staying on top of the\r\nconspiracy sub-plot, I yearned for the agents
    to consummate their\r\nrelationship. Judging from X-Files Internet bulletin boards
    and chatroom\r\nbuzz, I was far from alone. Neither character was with anyone
    else, at\r\nleast not for long, and each death-defying adventure tested and\r\nconfirmed
    the soundness of their trust in one another in a world\r\nincreasingly exposed
    as irrational and conspiracy-ridden. They were\r\nclearly falling in love; why
    didnâ\x80\x99t they just go to bed?\r\n\r\nOf course, Carter is not the first
    to explore the possibilities of\r\nplatonic love. Indeed, it is only in the past
    hundred or so years that\r\nWestern societies have seriously entertained the possibility
    of\r\ncombining true love, sexual desire and the business of marriage all in\r\none
    relationship. Before this, the person with whom one was passionately\r\n\\`\\`in
    loveâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99 was rarely either the person one desperately wanted to\r\nshag
    or to shack up with domestically. While spousal pairs saw to the\r\nbusiness of
    running a household and creating and raising children, messy\r\nand unpredictable
    sexual passions were the province of the lover. True\r\nlove was typically reserved
    for a special or \\`\\`sentimentalâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 friend of\r\nthe same gender.\r\n\r\nThis
    was not only because it was believed that sexual passions were\r\nephemeral and,
    thus, inappropriate in any relationship in which\r\nstability was required, but
    also because the meeting of mind and spirit\r\ncharacteristic of true love was
    unlikely to take place between members\r\nof the opposite sex. Upper-class men
    and women were raised and educated\r\nseparately and lived their lives in separate
    \\`\\`spheresâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99. Not only did\r\nthey have little in common, they
    also were raised to profoundly distrust\r\none another. Men were encouraged to
    think of women as their intellectual\r\ninferiors.\r\n\r\nScully and Mulder are
    also very different. In an inversion of the usual\r\nstereotype, Scully is the
    rational medical scientist, and Mulder the\r\ninstinct-driven paranormal expert.
    However, because their relationship\r\nis grounded in trust, intellectual respect
    and their shared search for\r\n\\`\\`the truthâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99, these differences
    are seen to draw the pair closer and\r\nenrich the meaning of their journey together,
    rather than estrange them.\r\nIndeed, it is the rock-solid nature of their trust
    - a trust that\r\ncontrasts strongly with their attitude to the rest of the world
    - that\r\nis the basis of their transcendent love. In my dreams, Mulder tells\r\nScully,
    you were the only one who told me the truth. Even when my world\r\nwas falling
    apart, you were my constant, my touchstone.\r\n\r\nWith these words, I felt my
    fervent desire to see them fall into bed\r\ntogether evaporate. They could; they
    didnâ\x80\x99t have to; who cared? Where\r\nelse could sex take them that they
    hadnâ\x80\x99t already been?\r\n\r\nTwo episodes later, having realised they no
    longer needed to avoid sex\r\nbecause of the Victorian fear - couched in modern-day
    lingo - of\r\n\\`\\`screwing up the relationshipâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99, Scully and
    Mulder kiss. It happens\r\nright after they have successfully vanquished a millennium
    cult and are\r\nwatching the ball descend in Times Square on television. Then
    they smile\r\nat one another. \\`\\`The world didnâ\x80\x99t end,â\x80\x99â\x80\x99
    Mulder mumbles. \\`\\`No, it\r\ndidnâ\x80\x99t,â\x80\x99â\x80\x99 Scully replies.
    And, with their arms around one another, they\r\nhead down the hall to begin the
    New Year.\r\n\r\nScully and Mulder are Gen-Xers engaged in the quintessential\r\n21st-century
    relationship - it takes place at work, is based in trust,\r\nrespectful of intellectual
    difference and shag-neutral. Such a prototype\r\nshould be unsurprising for a
    generation whose youthful reality, unlike\r\nthose who came immediately before,
    included venereal diseases that kill\r\nand increasing amounts of time spent in
    cyberspace, where the nature of\r\nsex - among other things - is constantly evolving.\r\n\r\nSo
    maybe this couple will shag and maybe they wonâ\x80\x99t. The important thing\r\nis
    that their relationship neither needs sex, nor needs sex kept out of\r\nit. This
    love is other than that."
