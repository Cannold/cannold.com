    Warner 2005). Callgirl: Confessions of a double life by Jeanette\r\nAngell (Schwartz,
    2005)\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s a big year for books on prostitution, with Call Me Elizabeth\r\nand
    Callgirl only some of the volumes weighing down gender studies\r\nshelves across
    the nation. At the start of Callgirl Angell gives us an\r\ninkling as to the cause
    of the current obsession when she writes that\r\nâ\x80\x9Cpeople look at me and
    get a little scared. I could be - I am - one of\r\nthem. I am their sister, their
    neighbour, their girlfriend. Iâ\x80\x99m nobodyâ\x80\x99s\r\nidea of what a whore
    looks like. Maybe thatâ\x80\x99s why Iâ\x80\x99m scary. They want\r\ncallgirls
    to be different, identifiable. That keeps them safe.â\x80\x9D\r\nThirty-five years
    after second-wave feminism and in the midst of rising\r\ndivorce rates, declining
    fertility and increasing numbers of women\r\nwilling and able - should a suitable
    male fail to appear - to go\r\nmotherhood alone, many of us are confused not just
    about what women\r\nwant, but who women really are. Exposes of the secret worlds
    of women\r\nwho appear average or even respectable on the outside tantalises us
    with\r\nthe prospect of finding out.\r\n\r\nIn important ways, the stories of
    both women - one British, the other\r\nAmerican - and the first-person narrative
    form in which they tell them,\r\nare strikingly similar. Women facing fiscal ruin
    from good-for-nothing\r\nmen, and making peanuts in their day job, give into the
    lure of the\r\n$200USD or 125 pounds per hour pay rate for women willing to have
    sex\r\nwith strangers. From their first encounter to the ongoing maintenance of\r\ntheir
    sanity, physical health and secrecy as they pursue their\r\nalternative career
    through long gruelling nights, both Call Me Elizabeth\r\nand Callgirl provide
    a straightforward and informative trek through the\r\ncomforts, tedium and insult
    of selling oneâ\x80\x99s body for a living.\r\n\r\nBut hereâ\x80\x99s where the
    similarities end. Call Me Elizabeth reads like one\r\nlong mea culpa from the
    incarnated stereotype of a whore with the heart\r\nof gold. Annandale claims that
    the only reason she works as an escort is\r\nto save her children being â\x80\x9Cdestabalisedâ\x80\x9D
    by changes to home and school\r\nthat would accompany the familyâ\x80\x99s financial
    ruin. For Annandale,\r\nprostitution is never anything but â\x80\x9Cexhausting,
    awful, degradingâ\x80\x9D but\r\nnecessary for a woman with a drawerful of bills
    and an selfless\r\ncommitment to doing whatever it takes to protect her family.
    Indeed, she\r\ndesperate is Annandale for us to see her as a good mother that
    she not\r\nonly repeats her family-oriented motives ad nauseum, but quotes others\r\nwho
    understand her behaviourthis way. At the end of her first night with\r\nher driver
    Kevin, for example, she tells how he helped her out of the\r\ncar and said something
    that stayed with her:\r\n\r\n[He] told me that he wished he had a mother like
    me, someone who had\r\nloved him in the way that I obviously loved my children.
    â\x80\x98Hold your head\r\nup, darlinâ\x80\x99, youâ\x80\x99re fuckinâ\x80\x99
    special, you areâ\x80\x99. In contrast, Angellâ\x80\x99s\r\ncredentials as an
    academic sociologist lead her to attempt a more\r\nsophisticated analysis of prostitution,
    though with somewhat mixed\r\nsuccess. In the early pages of the book, she pursues
    a\r\nprostitution-is-no-more-degrading-to-women-than-oppressive-low-paid-work\r\nand
    an all-sex-is-an-exchange-of-sorts line. Angell even suggests that\r\nher considerable
    sex drive and mastery at pleasuring others means her\r\nwork offers a double bonus
    of sexual pleasure and pay. But by chapter 3\r\nthis switches - with no explanation
    - to a more matter-of-fact\r\nunderstanding of prostitution as wearing, degrading
    and at times\r\ndangerous work that women only undertake because they desperately
    needs\r\nthe cash. â\x80\x9CThe fact is,â\x80\x9D writes Angell, â\x80\x9Cit was
    prostitution. You can\r\ndress it up however youâ\x80\x99d like; but for me to
    tell myself that earning\r\nmy living as a prostitute was a situation that couldnâ\x80\x99t
    get any better\r\nwas at best a little naÃ¯ve. At worst a little delusional.â\x80\x9D
    A callgirl,\r\nAngell tells us, gets about as much excitement out of a call as
    she does\r\ngoing out to the supermarket.\r\n\r\nI have no problem with the conclusion
    that prostitution is oppressive.\r\nIndeed, Angellâ\x80\x99s blow-by-blow description
    of her clientele - some of\r\nwhom manipulate, insult and even assault her - leaves
    little doubt as to\r\nhow she arrived there. But I was left wondering how such
    a conclusion\r\njived with her seeming rejection of classic feminist analysis
    of\r\nprostitution as degrading to women: a rejection she seems to transport\r\ninto
    the undergraduate class she teaches on the history and sociology of\r\nprostitution.
    Or her assertion that prostitution ought to be legalised.\r\nAnd how do Angellâ\x80\x99s
    repeated assertions that sheâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9Cnobodyâ\x80\x99s idea of\r\nwhat
    a whore looks likeâ\x80\x9D fit with her consistent line that any woman -\r\nour
    sisters, neighbours or girlfriends - could and may very well be\r\ncallgirls?
    Add to this an exasperatingly posey and staccato prose style,\r\nand it seems
    unlikely those interested in a sustained and satisfying\r\nexperiential exploration
    of prostitution will be satisfied with\r\nCallgirl."
