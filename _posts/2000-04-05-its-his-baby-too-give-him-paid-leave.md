    to Kathy Lette, in excruciating pain from labor, and awaiting the\r\nfather of
    her child in the ward: \\`\\`Donâ\x80\x99t worry. Some men just donâ\x80\x99t\r\nwant
    to be here.â\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLette, angrily: \\`\\`Hey. Iâ\x80\x98d prefer
    not to be here!â\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\n\r\nTONY BLAIR has admitted he isnâ\x80\x99t
    sure whether heâ\x80\x99ll take paternity leave\r\ninMay, when wife Cherie is
    due to drop the coupleâ\x80\x99s fourth bundle. While\r\nCherie was publicly expressing
    her interest in seeing Tony take\r\nadvantage of his right to leave, he was mumbling
    about his pressing\r\nresponsibilities to ensure the country was properly run.\r\n\r\nAn
    astounding 57 per cent of Britons agreed that, while it is a good\r\nidea for
    a new father to take time off to help, Tonyâ\x80\x99s job was too\r\nimportant
    for him to do so.\r\n\r\nOf course, Cherie also has an important job. Sheâ\x80\x99s
    a QC, a judge and a\r\nleading employment rights lawyer. However, no prizes for
    guessing how\r\nthe British public would have responded had she announced her
    intention\r\nto get straight back to work after the baby was born. \\`\\`I have
    a\r\ncourtroom to run,â\x80\x99â\x80\x99 one can hear her insisting, while she
    dodges rotten\r\ntomatoes and the deafening sound of public accusations of bad\r\nmotherhood.\r\n\r\nThe
    point, of course, is that despite the calendar showing the year\r\n2000, many
    people still hold distinctly 1950s views about the\r\ndifferences between the
    feelings mothers and fathers have about new\r\nbabies, and their respective responsibilities
    for child care.\r\n\r\nSuch dated mythology holds that the maternal instinct leads
    women to\r\nyearn to provide infant care, and to be uniquely suited to doing so.
    So\r\nfulfilled are women by nurturing babies in their bodies and at their\r\nbreasts
    that they donâ\x80\x99t even notice - little less mind - the devastating\r\nimpact
    the baby has on their former existence as a grown-up. They yearn\r\nto take time
    out from their careers and to be there at those 3am feeds.\r\nThe symbiotic nature
    of the maternal-child bond also means the baby is\r\ncompletely satiated by its
    motherâ\x80\x99s - but only its motherâ\x80\x99s - nurturing\r\nand love.\r\n\r\nSo
    where exactly does that leave Dad? Most likely folding the laundry,\r\nscreening
    calls and worrying about paying the mounting pile of bills\r\nwith no money coming
    in. No wonder he yearns to stay at work, or to get\r\nback as soon as possible.
    It is at work that his role outside and inside\r\nthe family is socially recognised
    and sanctioned: as paid worker and\r\nfamily breadwinner.\r\n\r\nWhile both the
    British and Australian Governments mandate the provision\r\nof parental leave
    (up to 52 weeks for Australian mums and dads, and 13\r\nweeks for British dads
    and 40 for mums), only British mums are entitled\r\nto be paid for any of that.
    While the enormous costs to working mothers\r\nof unpaid maternity leave are recognised,
    the cost to working fathers is\r\nless often discussed.\r\n\r\nThe governmentsâ\x80\x99
    refusal to ensure adequate paid paternity leave\r\nreinforces the view that men
    are dispensable at home, but not at work.\r\nFew families can afford to go without
    both earners for long, and\r\nmaternal mythology and the greater likelihood that
    a workplace agreement\r\nwill ensure the woman gets at least part of her maternity
    leave paid,\r\nmakes it more likely the person staying at home will be mum.\r\n\r\nThe
    Swedes solve this problem by providing a full year of parental leave\r\npaid at
    85per cent of the lost wage, at least a month of which must be\r\ntaken by the
    father or forfeited. By paying fathers and mothers to\r\nparent, the Swedish Government
    is reinforcing family-values talk with\r\nreal action - action that ensures parents
    understand that their\r\ncontribution as a parent as well as as a worker is socially
    valued.\r\n\r\nBlair has been criticised by some commentators for refusing to
    make what\r\namounts to the symbolic gesture of taking a week or two of paternity\r\nleave.
    But taking paternity leave must have more than symbolic value to\r\ntruly transform
    the social and parental roles of men and women.\r\n\r\nRegardless of which way
    Blair jumps, the behavior of British fathers\r\ntowards paternity leave - and
    paternity in general - is unlikely to\r\nchange until they are told, in both words
    and dollars, that they are as\r\nneeded and important at home as they are at the
    office."
