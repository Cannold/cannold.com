  content: "For me, the news of Steve Irwinâ\x80\x99s death caused a Diana moment:
    the\r\nmolasses, freeze-time moment of shock that sears whatever one was doing\r\n-
    going to lunch, cleaning the fridge, having a shower - on oneâ\x80\x99s\r\nconsciousness
    for ever. I sat at my computer and cried.\r\n\r\nWhy has Irwinâ\x80\x99s death
    hit many of us so hard? In the rush to eulogise\r\nhim, several explanations of
    what he meant to Australia and Australians\r\nhave been served up. According to
    the Opposition Leader, Irwin was the\r\nâ\x80\x9Cquintessential Aussie Battlerâ\x80\x9D
    who was a â\x80\x9Cterrific exponent of\r\nAustralian larrikin valuesâ\x80\x9D.
    Those in the tourist trade - at times\r\nseeming sadder about the loss of a product
    than a person - proclaimed\r\nhim the â\x80\x9Cambassadorâ\x80\x9D for Queensland
    and Australia.\r\n\r\nThis is rubbish and, ironically just the sort that was responsible
    for\r\nthe subdued response some Australians had to the Crocodile Hunter when\r\ncompared
    to the untrammelled celebrity he enjoyed in the US. Few\r\nnational groups, Australians
    included, are going to take kindly to being\r\nrepresented at home or abroad by
    a single individual, no matter who they\r\nare or what they do. Such resistance
    is only likely to increase when the\r\nsummary of national identity includes phrases
    like sunburnt, rugged,\r\nover-the-top and oafish, not necessarily in that order.\r\n\r\nIrwin
    never claimed to represent Australia or Australians overseas, or\r\nto in any
    way summarise how we think or who we are. The reality, which\r\nhe knew better
    than anyone, was that he was about as far from the\r\nquintessential Australian
    as you could get: a bush dweller and\r\nconservationist in a land of confirmed
    suburbanites indifferent to their\r\never-expanding environmental footprints;
    a warp-speed extravert whose\r\nchosen adverbs of degree - absolutely, extremely,
    really - contrasted\r\ntellingly to the preference of his compatriots for somewhat,
    rather and\r\nâ\x80\x9Ca bitâ\x80\x9D. In a telling interview with Andrew Denton
    in 2003, replayed on\r\nABC TV last night as a tribute, Irwin frankly acknowledged
    the\r\nembarrassment he caused his compatriots. Iâ\x80\x99m embarrassing, he explained\r\nbecause
    â\x80\x9Cthereâ\x80\x99s a little bit of me in everybodyâ\x80\x9D. In addition,
    what\r\nIrwin called the â\x80\x9Cyeah, yeah, take it or leave itâ\x80\x9D attitude
    of Aussies\r\nto everything, made them uncomfortable with his passionate embrace
    of\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nHe may have only got it half right. As far as I can see,
    thereâ\x80\x99s way too\r\nlittle of Irwin in most of us. Not only do we know
    it, we work damn hard\r\nto keep it that way, for precisely the reasons Irwin
    nominates: our fear\r\nof appearing too invested in or excited about anything.
    Itâ\x80\x99s all\r\nterribly English, really. Being so relaxed weâ\x80\x99re horizontal
    is a highly\r\nesteemed Australian characteristic, and if the upshot of our commitment\r\nto
    indifference is a loss of our own passion for the things that really\r\nmatter
    to us, and a disdain for the untrammelled enthusiasm of others,\r\nthan so be
    it.\r\n\r\nAre we afraid of failure? This is the classic analysis of those afraid\r\nof
    trying too hard, but I think what stymies us is more pedestrian: a\r\nfear of
    the unpredictable and potentially uncomfortable social\r\nsituations that could
    result if people drop roles and abandon lines.\r\nWild, larger-than-life characters
    like Irwin - hyper-extraverts - are\r\nunpredictable; you never know what they
    might say or do. They could ask\r\nyou for something you donâ\x80\x99t want to
    give, or beg conflict by saying\r\nsomething you donâ\x80\x99t want to hear. They
    must be subdued through ridicule\r\nor marginalisation, or frozen out completely
    to manage our collective\r\nfear of the awkward moment.\r\n\r\nAmericans have
    no such fear, and this may partially explain their\r\nunequivocal hero-worship
    of Irwin. In fact, I suspect the real source of\r\nAmericanâ\x80\x99s love-affair
    with Irwin was not what made him Australian, but\r\nthe Americanness of much of
    his personality. Hyper-extraversion, and its\r\nsuperlative sidekicks of uncontained
    passion and enthusiasm, are what\r\nAmericans love and admire about themselves.
    How flattering to see them\r\nemulated by the nationâ\x80\x99s good friends Down
    Under, and in a cute Aussie\r\naccent to boot.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps testament
    to the complexity of the Australian character\r\nthat while Irwinâ\x80\x99s energy
    and passion made us anxious, we also admired\r\nit. Many, myself included, couldnâ\x80\x99t
    help but feel terribly fond of the\r\nman. As he told Denton, he was the boy who
    never grew up, and we\r\ncouldnâ\x80\x99t help but smile at his boundless enthusiasm
    and energy,\r\nchildlike faith in his invincibility when it came to animal stings
    or\r\nbites, and his inability to be other than himself or to even waste time\r\ntrying.\r\n\r\nHe
    was one out of the box, and I know Iâ\x80\x99m going to miss him like hell."
