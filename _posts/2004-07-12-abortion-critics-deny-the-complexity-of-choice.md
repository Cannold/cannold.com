    wonâ\x80\x99t screen in\r\nAustralia until August 8, but debate has already begun
    about whether the\r\nfilm should be censored, and the impact it will have on political
    debate\r\nabout abortion.\r\n\r\nThe film, made while Black was pregnant with
    her first child,\r\nreconsiders an abortion she had over a decade earlier. It
    shows a\r\nfour-week pregnant woman having a suction termination, as well as foetal\r\nremains
    at 10, 11 and 21 weeks gestation. The filmmaker claims, in an\r\narticle in The
    Observer, to present both sides of the â\x80\x9Crealityâ\x80\x9D of\r\nabortion:
    balancing what she describes as â\x80\x9Cshocking, repulsive, and\r\nconfrontationalâ\x80\x9D
    images of aborted foetuses with the circumstances and\r\nemotions of the unhappily
    pregnant women forced to choose.\r\n\r\nThere is no question in my mind that My
    Foetus should be screened. For\r\none, it is an unprecedented opportunity for
    the public to see\r\nfoetal-remains accompanied by accurate captions and commentary.
    For too\r\nlong, the anti-choice movement has mislabelled images of older fetuses\r\nas
    those of 14 weeks gestational age or younger (not coincidentally, the\r\nperiod
    when approximately 95 per cent of abortions take place). For too\r\nlong, the
    anti-choice movement has used voice-overs in propaganda films\r\nsuch as The Silent
    Scream (in which the ultrasonographic images used are\r\nso fuzzy and unclear
    as to be unrecognisable without narrative\r\ndirection) to imply women who abort
    are heartless and cruel.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, pro-choice advocates have long
    seen the foetus as the\r\nproperty of the other side: accepting anti-choice claims
    that if the\r\nfetus is admitted to be both human and alive, abortion must be\r\nacknowledged
    as morally wrong and made illegal - again.\r\n\r\nYet, as fetal imagery becomes
    increasingly ubiquitous (who amongst us\r\nhasnâ\x80\x99t seen an ultrasound image
    or an anti-choice billboard?), this\r\nposition has become increasingly politically
    risky. Black is right to\r\nfeel that the pro-choice movement must reclaim the
    foetus, though I\r\ndisagree with her assertion that the reason the movement has
    shied away\r\nin the past is the â\x80\x9Crepulsivenessâ\x80\x9D of foetal remains.\r\n\r\nNo,
    the real problem with focusing on the fetus is that it leaves women\r\n- literally
    - out of the picture. A typical fetal image is of a\r\nballed-up cosmonaut in
    a circular, disembodied capsule. It is rare for\r\nthe line surrounding the fetus
    to even gesture at its reality as a\r\nwomanâ\x80\x99s womb, or to the geographical
    relationship of the capsule to the\r\nrest of the womanâ\x80\x99s body (is she
    sitting or standing? In which direction\r\nare her feet and face?)\r\n\r\nMore
    importantly than her body, a focus on the fetus leaves the womanâ\x80\x99s\r\nlife
    out of the picture: her partnership status; her ability to parent\r\nwell; her
    plans and ambitions for the future. Yet it precisely this\r\ncontext, and the
    way the woman approaches and makes her decision, that\r\nmakes her choice comprehensible,
    and provides its moral texture and\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nThe anti-choice movement
    knows this. That is why the â\x80\x9Chard casesâ\x80\x9D -\r\nunwanted pregnancies
    resulting from incest and rape, or those that\r\nthreaten a womanâ\x80\x99s life
    - split the movement in two. Because while such\r\nfoetuses are as alive and human
    as any other, most refuse to condemn\r\nwomen who abort in such circumstances.
    Better than any other, these\r\ncases show it is our judgements about womenâ\x80\x99s
    motives and intentions\r\nthat determine our moral evaluation of her particular
    abortion. And\r\nexperience shows such judgements to be harsher for strangers,
    and kinder\r\nfor friends. Abortion clinic staff repeatedly report doing terminations\r\nfor
    anti-choice protesters, only to find them - weeks later - on the\r\npicket lines
    again.\r\n\r\nAs Blackâ\x80\x99s film testifies, feeling bad about abortion (or,
    more\r\nprecisely, feeling bad about finding oneself in the position of having\r\nto
    face the decision at all) is testament that our moral sensibilities\r\nare finely
    tuned, not that abortion is wrong. Most people who choose\r\ndivorce, particularly
    those with children, feel less than exultant about\r\nhaving to make that decision;
    yet few believe this proves the choice was\r\nwrong, or should be legally denied.\r\n\r\nBlack
    rarely spoke of her long-ago abortion. Few of the one in three\r\nwomen who will
    have an abortion in their lifetime do. She says she wants\r\nher film to change
    that, and the laws that in both the UK and many\r\nstates in Australia that hand
    doctors ultimate control over whether a\r\nwoman can get an abortion; requiring
    women â\x80\x9Cto plead insanity to end an\r\nunwanted pregnancy.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThe
    truth is no one knows what the reaction of the Australian public\r\nwill be to
    the film. But there is no reason why, if Black has done her\r\nwork well - ensuring
    both women and foetuses remain in the frame - than\r\nsupporters of abortion rights
    have anything to fear. It is a anti-choice\r\nmyth that women donâ\x80\x99t really
    know what they are doing when they\r\nterminate, and that seeing foetal remains
    will reveal some previously\r\nunrealised â\x80\x9Ctruthâ\x80\x9D about the procedure.\r\n\r\nThe
    morality of abortion is, and will always be, far more complicated\r\nthan that."
