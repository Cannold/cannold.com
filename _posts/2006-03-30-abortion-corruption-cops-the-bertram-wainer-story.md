    deserted pregnant wives taking their children and jumping\r\noff the St Kilda

    Street for the strangerâ\x80\x99s car that would take\r\nthem, huddled beneath

    be dumped on the corner near the Royal\r\nWomenâ\x80\x99s in the hope that someone
    would find them in time. Many died.\r\n\r\nThis was the reproductive terrain that
    Victorian women were forced to\r\nnegotiate 35 years ago when their â\x80\x9Clittle
    friendâ\x80\x9D failed to arrive and,\r\nbecause they were sick, poor, young,
    bashed or simply unable to shoulder\r\nthe burdens of motherhood at that time,
    decided to seek an abortion. For\r\nwomen of means, the illegal procedure would
    be provided by a qualified\r\ngynaecologist in the comfort of a private hospital.
    Poor women took\r\ntheir chances with well-meaning neighbourhood â\x80\x9CVera
    Drakesâ\x80\x9D or similarly\r\nunqualified â\x80\x9Cbackyarders.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIn
    1967 Bertram Wainer, a Scottish-born St Kilda GP with a passionate\r\ncommitment
    to social justice and Jo Wainer, incipient feminist and\r\ninaugural secretary
    of the Abortion Law Reform Association, sought\r\nreform. In the process, they
    uncovered a web of corruption involving\r\ndoctors, backyard abortionists, high-ranking
    policemen and suspect\r\npoliticians. They ran three separate test cases to test
    the reach of the\r\nnewly-minted Menhennitt ruling that allowed abortion, prohibited
    in the\r\nVictorian Crimes Act, in a limited range of circumstances.\r\n\r\nBert
    Wainerâ\x80\x99s story is told in Abortion, Corruption & Cops, a film by\r\nwriter/director
    John Moore, whose previous credits include the\r\naward-winning documentary Guns
    & Roses and Thomas of Arnhem Land. Moving\r\nseamlessly between archival footage
    and dramatic recreations with Kurt\r\nGeyer as Bert Wainer and Genevieve Picot
    as\r\nbackyard-abortionist-turned-good Peggy Berman, Moore summons up the\r\nstifling
    prudery and religious moralism of the era. He interviews\r\ngrandmotherly-looking
    women whose eyes grow bright with fright as they\r\nremember having to spread
    their legs on a strangerâ\x80\x99s kitchen table while\r\ninstruments boiled away
    on the stove, or who still find it hard to laugh\r\nwhen they recall how an unwanted
    pregnancy gave a girl first-hand\r\nknowledge of the â\x80\x9Clies, exploitation
    and deviousnessâ\x80\x9D that accompany all\r\nillegal practices.\r\n\r\nBut Bert
    Wainerâ\x80\x99s story should resonate for more than just history\r\nbuffs. The
    Federal Governmentâ\x80\x99s ill-disguised antagonism towards womenâ\x80\x99s\r\nreproductive
    rights gives relevance to Wainerâ\x80\x99s assertion that â\x80\x9Cabortion\r\nwill
    continue and have little, if anything, to do with the Church, the\r\nlaw or the
    doctors, but have a very great deal to do with people and\r\nparticularly with
    womenâ\x80\x9D. His moral indignation about police\r\nconfiscation of medical
    files, which he saw as an attack patient privacy\r\nand dignity, seems a salutary
    reminder of the importance of these values\r\nin light of recent government proposals
    to introduce a specific Medicare\r\nitem number for abortion counselling that
    could enable tracking of\r\ndoctors and women. â\x80\x9CEvery child a wanted childâ\x80\x9D,
    the poster Wainer\r\nproudly hangs in his newly opened fertility clinic in East
    Melbourne,\r\nremains a pertinent reply to those who hand-wring about the number
    of\r\nabortions.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CStand for something or fall for anythingâ\x80\x9D,
    goes the old saying. Until\r\nhis death in 1987, Wainer stood for many things.
    It was his deep respect\r\nfor the police and their role in enforcing the rule
    of law that saw him\r\ndevastated by his discovery of corruption in the force,
    and his decision\r\nto turn whistle-blower. As a medical student and intern, heâ\x80\x99d
    had little\r\ninterest in abortion and, like other reputable doctors at the time,
    had\r\nsimply referred women to illegal provides when they came to him for\r\nhelp.
    But when a woman came into his surgery dying from a botched\r\nabortion but too
    terrified to go to hospital for fear of arrest, he\r\nrefused to look the other
    way. He got indignant, angry and - in the best\r\nfeminist tradition - active.
    But while sympathetic to women, Wainer was\r\nno feminist. The man Moore describes
    in Abortion Corruption & Cops is a\r\nsocial justice campaigner. A man whose own
    deprived upbringing had\r\nalerted him to the ways in which the rich could circumvent
    harsh and\r\nunjust laws, while the poor were forced to live with - or die from
    -\r\ntheir consequences.\r\n\r\nIn her new book about womenâ\x80\x99s stories
    of illegal abortion, timed for\r\nrelease to coincide with the screening of Abortion,
    Corruption & Cops,\r\nJo Wainer says that having â\x80\x9Ctweaked the tailâ\x80\x9D
    of the State, Bert\r\nsuffered its retributive power. In return for having forced
    a public\r\ninquiry into police corruption and opened the stateâ\x80\x99s first
    legal\r\nabortion clinic. Bert Wainer was bankrupted by the Australian Tax\r\nOffice,
