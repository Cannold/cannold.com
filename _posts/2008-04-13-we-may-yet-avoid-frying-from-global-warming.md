    You know how the Stern Report said weâ\x80\x99ve only got\r\neight to eighteen
    years left to significantly reduce global emissions or\r\nrisk costly and irreversible
    damage to the planet? And how, despite\r\nthis, global leaders continue to do
    bugger-all to fix the problem? To do\r\nso little, in fact, that most of us have
    concluded that either they are\r\nbooked on a well-furnished galactic space station
    that the rest of us\r\ndonâ\x80\x99t know about or, even more depressingly, that
    what is collectively\r\nrequired of us to save the planet is beyond our capacity
    to achieve?\r\n\r\nWell, turns out that despite this tragic state of affairs,
    we-or our\r\nchildren or grandchildren-may not have to die. Because there is a
    Plan\r\nC.\r\n\r\nPlan B requires governments to develop and commercialise carbon-neutral\r\nenergy
    and energy conservation technologies. A good idea but, like Plan\r\nA, still awaiting
    action on the policy front.\r\n\r\nEnter Plan C: climate engineering. Whether
    itâ\x80\x99s chucking\r\nlight-refracting sulphur particles into the stratosphere
    or using soot\r\nto create mini â\x80\x9Cnuclear winters,â\x80\x9D weâ\x80\x99re
    talking technology designed to\r\nfix what technology has wrought. Currently,
    such plans are\r\nunder-developed: a mix of educated speculation and back-of-the-envelope\r\ncalculations.
    But if they work, theyâ\x80\x99ll be cheap and quick to deploy.\r\n\r\nSo why
    have scientists, across these basic facts for at least fifteen\r\nyears, not begin
    seriously discussing them until last year?\r\n\r\nBecause they thought they shouldnâ\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nIn
    an extraordinary and perhaps unprecedented act of self-censorship,\r\nthey seem
    to have kept mum-shelving papers, shunning mavericks~~-\r\nbecause they believed
    that if political leaders knew there was a\r\nget-out-of-climate-change-free card
    in the offing, theyâ\x80\x98d never make the\r\nhard choices necessary to deal
    with the problem \"properlyâ\x80\x99~~-by reducing\r\nemissions.\r\n\r\nBut hereâ\x80\x99s
    the question: is such self-censorship the commendable action\r\nof a bunch of
    blokes (and yes, they are all blokes) to protect the\r\npublic good, or an unjustified
    act of paternalism? And what do we think\r\nof the fact that at least some scientists
    kept mum because they believed\r\nthat because a technological fix was relatively
    easy, it was necessarily\r\nbad?\r\n\r\nIf climate engineering is bad~~~~enabling
    us to sow carbon without\r\nreaping its negative consequences~~~~than self-censorsing
    was the\r\nhonourable thing to do. It may even have been required given the\r\nUniversal
    Ethical Codeâ\x80\x99s demand that scientists â\x80\x9Cminimise and justifyâ\x80\x9D\r\nany
    adverse effect their work may have on living creatures and the\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, if we think that a techno-fix is a bloody good idea,\r\nthen the
    delay self-censorship may have caused to the commencement of\r\nthe small reversible
    studies that will tell us whether the technology\r\nwill work, and about its side
    effects, is unconscionable.\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99ll be frank. People who oppose technology
