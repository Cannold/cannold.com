    house\r\nseveral weeks ago renewed controversy about the showâ\x80\x99s suitability
    for\r\nfree-to-air TV.\r\n\r\nOf course for some, the issue was decided long ago.
    Victorian Family\r\nCouncil Secretary Bill Muelenberg, Family First Senator Senator
    Steven\r\nFielding and Queensland Nationals MP Paul Neville have long condemned\r\nthe
    show as sleazy and dangerously sexually licentious. In the wake of\r\nthe weekendâ\x80\x99s
    â\x80\x9Cincidentâ\x80\x9D, this conga line was joined by the leaders of\r\nboth
    major parties. The Opposition Leader lamented the showâ\x80\x99s treatment\r\nof
    young women, while the Prime Minister asked Channel Ten to take the\r\nâ\x80\x9Cstupid
    programâ\x80\x9D off air.\r\n\r\nAre calls for media self-censorship evidence
    of feminist inroads into\r\nthe sensibilities of the nationâ\x80\x99s leaders,
    the relentless crusade of\r\nChristian moralists to control what the rest of us
    see, hear and read,\r\nor just plain commonsense? Was the two minutes that shook
    the world in\r\nthe collective bedroom of the Big Brother household evidence of
    the\r\ndepravity of todayâ\x80\x99s male youth, or just how far - in the sexual\r\npolitics
    stakes - theyâ\x80\x99ve come?\r\n\r\nDeciding requires us to disentangle the
    varied business and moral\r\nmandates in play. From a commercial point of view,
    itâ\x80\x99s arguable that\r\nChannel 10 had little choice but to follow the advice
    of media studies\r\nacademic Catherine Lumby and evict the men from the house
    for being on\r\nthe wrong side of what Lumby described as the line dividing â\x80\x9Csexual\r\nbehaviour
    and sexual assaultâ\x80\x9D. The recent axing of Big Brother Adults\r\nafter pressure
    from Coalition MPs proved the not inconsiderable sway of\r\nthe Christian right
    in this country, and appeasing them by turfing the\r\nmen out and inviting the
    Queensland police to investigate made good\r\nbusiness sense.\r\n\r\nThe networkâ\x80\x99s
    response, however, says little about whether the behaviour\r\nof the two men merited
    condemnation on moral grounds. Lumby said the men\r\nwere guilty of sexual assault,
    while Communications Minister Helen\r\nCoonan charged them with objectifying women.
    But in all the frenetic\r\ntut-tutting that surrounded the case, few have considered
    whether the\r\nyoung menâ\x80\x99s response to Camillaâ\x80\x99s objection to
    their unquestionably\r\ninappropriate behaviour shows a solid understanding of
    the key feminist\r\nprinciple that whatever she wears and wherever she goes, when
    a woman\r\nsays â\x80\x9Cnoâ\x80\x9D, she means â\x80\x9Cnoâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nThe
    footage confirms Big Brotherâ\x80\x99s deliberate construction of sexually\r\ncharged
    situations that the young people of the house are expected to\r\nsmoothly and
    consistently negotiate before a national audience. In the\r\nmoments leading up
    the incident, Camilla - wearing underwear and a\r\ncleavage-revealing skivvy -
    slides into John and Ashâ\x80\x99s bed. A moment\r\nlater, Johnâ\x80\x99s arm
    is pressing her to the bed, while Ash appears to whip\r\nout his genitals and
    rub them in her face. This part of the story we\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nWhat has received
    less attention is what comes next. Camilla vocally\r\nobjects to what is happening
    to her and the lads withdraw, immediately\r\nand fully.\r\n\r\nThere is no question
    that John and Ashâ\x80\x99s forceful act of restraint and\r\nsexual domination
    of\r\n\r\nCamilla should not - without her express and prior permission - have\r\ntaken
    place. For this, they owed her a sincere and profound apology.\r\nHowever, it
    seems an act of deliberate blindness to ignore the alacrity\r\nwith which the
    men responded to her insistence that they back off.\r\nSurveys continue to show
    a disturbing number of men continue to believe\r\nwomen really mean â\x80\x9Cyesâ\x80\x9D
    when they say â\x80\x9Cnoâ\x80\x9D. John and Ash, however, donâ\x80\x99t\r\nappear
    to be among them.\r\n\r\nMaintaining consent as the key arbiter of what constitutes
    assault or\r\notherwise deviant behaviour is critical to preserving the liberation
    of\r\nfemale desire and sexuality for which second-generation feminists\r\nstrove.
    Women can fancy a threesome, dig S& M or fantasise about\r\ngerbils. As long as
    they are competent, and freely give their consent,\r\nneither the label â\x80\x9Cvictimâ\x80\x9D
    or â\x80\x9Cslutâ\x80\x9D should apply.\r\n\r\nThe opposing point of view - endorsed
    by an uneasy colation of radical\r\nanti-porn feminist and Christian crusaders
    - is that some (mostly male)\r\nsexual behaviour is intrinsically aggressive or
    otherwise sinful, and\r\nneeds to be curtailed, for the sake of women and/or civilisation
    as a\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nWe can laugh at the arrogance and narrow-mindedness of such
    views, but\r\nthe barbarians are at the gate. Maintaining individual control over
    what\r\nwe watch, the privacy of our bedroom and how we define and express our\r\ndesires
    and capacities as men and women requires that we consistently\r\naffirm, in art
    as well as in life, the important of consent in defining\r\nwhat we do - and is
    done to us â\x80\x94 as right or wrong."
