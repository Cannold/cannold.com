    not sure, though one thing he did make clear during the\r\npress conferences clocking
    his demise was that the answer was none of\r\nour business. His behaviour was
    a â\x80\x9Cprivate matter,â\x80\x9D and his â\x80\x9Cfailingsâ\x80\x9D\r\nwere
    private, too.\r\n\r\nI couldnâ\x80\x99t agree more. If Spitzer says - which he
    does - that he failed\r\nhis Harvard-trained attorney wife Silda, his children
    and his entire\r\nfamily by sleeping with a prostitute, who am I to disagree?

    an Australian politician in Spitzerâ\x80\x99s shoes,\r\nthough in New South Wales
    and Victoria it would be unlikely that such an\r\nofficial would ever be charged.
    Indoor commercial sex was decriminalised\r\nn NSW, and partially legalised in
    Victoria, years ago. Among the reasons\r\nwhy is the distaste small-l liberals
    feel for the state sticking its\r\nbeak into peopleâ\x80\x99s private affairs.
    What two consenting adults get up to\r\nin bed is no oneâ\x80\x99s business but
    their own.\r\n\r\nThose on board - or should I say in bed? - with this philosophy
    may feel\r\nthat Spitzerâ\x80\x99s exit from public life is a shame, given all
    he had given\r\nto it. So he had sex with a prostitute. How exactly does this
    impact on\r\nhis ability to do his job?\r\n\r\nAmericans may be wondering about
    this, too. Throughout the semen stains,\r\ncigar speculations and impeachment
    proceedings that constituted the\r\nLewinsky affair, roughly 75% told pollsters
    they thought Bill Clinton\r\nwas fit to govern, and should remain as President.\r\n\r\nBut
    isnâ\x80\x99t it wrong for those meant to uphold the law to break it?\r\nAbsolutely.
    Doesnâ\x80\x99t Spitzerâ\x80\x99s behaviour show a failure of judgment or an\r\narrogant
    belief that he wouldnâ\x80\x99t be caught? Yep. Doesnâ\x80\x99t his zealous\r\npursuit
    of those running brothels - in the US and abroad - make him a\r\nhypocrite? Possibly,
    though he only prosecuted operators, never â\x80\x9Cjohns.â\x80\x9D\r\nWhat about
    Spitzerâ\x80\x99s repeated use of the name of a friend and donor -\r\nGeorge Fox

    to assertions that Spitzerâ\x80\x99s behaviour goes to character, I need to\r\nask,
    whose? In Australia, 19% of men have paid for sex at some point,\r\nwith reasons
    and situations varying. To my mind, itâ\x80\x99s those who cast\r\naspersions
    on all these menâ\x80\x99sâ\x80\x99 characters without knowing a thing abut\r\nthem
    or their situation - some cancer-stricken wives give their husbands\r\ntheir blessing
    - who have character questions to answer.\r\n\r\nSpitzer broke the law and for
    this he will rightly be made to pay. But\r\nhis story reminds us why laws that
