    lives.*\r\n\r\nIF YOU donâ\x80\x99t know it yet, you will soon. This year in the
    US, Bayer\r\nSchering Pharma is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the oral\r\ncontraceptive
    pill. Our turn comes next. The company launched the pill\r\nin Australia in 1961.\r\n\r\nAs
    head of a womenâ\x80\x99s reproductive rights advocacy group, I got the news\r\nearly,
    in a letter from Bayerâ\x80\x99s business unit telling of their planned\r\nâ\x80\x9Cnational
    communication programâ\x80\x9D to inform the public of â\x80\x9Cthis important\r\nmilestone
    in womenâ\x80\x99s healthcareâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nIt invited me to â\x80\x9Cbegin
    a dialogue of collaborationâ\x80\x9D that involved, as\r\nfar as I could tell
    when I rang the number supplied, my group singing\r\nfrom the Bayer song sheet
    about the companyâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9Cproud heritageâ\x80\x9D and\r\ncurrent practice
    of â\x80\x9Cproviding women with reliable and trusted\r\ncontraceptive optionsâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nAlready
    the media blitz has begun, with reports of a study showing that\r\nwomen taking
    the pill have a lower risk of dying from any cause when\r\ncompared with women
    who have never taken it. In fact, the research,\r\npartly funded by Schering -
    and with authors who list as competing\r\ninterests the receipt of payments from
    Schering Plough and Wyeth\r\nPharmaceutical - concludes only that â\x80\x9Cat
    least in â\x80¦ [a] relatively\r\nhealthy â\x80¦ cohort, oral contraception is
    not significantly associated\r\nwith a major public health problemâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nA
    more critical non-profit-driven analysis of the pillâ\x80\x99s impact on\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99s
    health and lives reveals long-standing feminist scepticism about\r\nthe first
    drug in history to be approved for long-term use by a healthy\r\nperson. It was
    known before the first pill ever hit the market that\r\nestrogen increased the
    risk of cancer, but the first pill contained\r\nmassive amounts of it - seven
    times as much as is used today.\r\n\r\nIn 1969, investigative journalist Barbara
    Seaman blew the whistle with\r\n*The Doctorâ\x80\x99s Case against the Pill*.
    The book prompted a US Senate\r\ninvestigation that saw the pill become the first
    prescription drug to be\r\naccompanied by package insert warnings. Seaman was
    blacklisted for her\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nMagazines, under pressure from the pharmaceutical
    industry threatening\r\nto withdraw advertising dollars, refused to run her stories.\r\n\r\nThe
    pill provides no protection against sexually transmitted infections,\r\nas some
    of those who came of age in the era of HIV/AIDS learned at their\r\nperil.\r\n\r\nSecond
    and third-generation pills may put users at increased risk of\r\ndeep vein thrombosis
    (especially if they are overweight), heart trouble\r\n(if they smoke), breast
    cancer (in the short term) and cervical cancer\r\n(in the longer term), although
    for some cancers, the drug seems\r\nprotective.\r\n\r\nThe pill is contraindicated
    for women with a history of migraines,\r\njaundice or liver problems and safety
    scares are not a thing of the\r\npast. In the midâ\x80\x931990s, women in some
    parts of Europe were told that\r\nâ\x80\x9Cthird generationâ\x80\x9D pills posed
    a greater risk of potentially fatal blood\r\nclots than their just-as-effective
    predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of such data led Public Citizen, a US consumer
    advocacy\r\ngroup, to petition the US Food and Drug Administration in 2007 to
    remove\r\nthe pills from sale.\r\n\r\nDespite all this, Seaman said shortly before
    her death in 2008 that if\r\nher daughters had wanted to go on the pill, she might
    have cried, but if\r\nher granddaughters should choose to, she could â\x80\x9Clive
    with thatâ\x80\x9D. Not\r\nthat she believed no questions remained, including
    those about possible\r\ninteractions between the pill and antidepressants, the
    most common drug\r\nprescribed to Australian women.\r\n\r\nIndeed, what becomes
    clear from looking at what data exists, is the\r\ncorruptive effect of pharmaceutical
    money on the knowledge necessary to\r\ngive women the information they need to
    make informed medical choices.\r\nDrug company-sponsored research tends to focus
    on potential new\r\nindications for old pharmaceuticals, or the relative benefits
    of a\r\ncompanyâ\x80\x99s new drug, compared with older offerings. Little research
    is\r\navailable that compares drugs with non-pharmaceutical responses to\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99s
    healthcare needs.\r\n\r\nThe sexual revolution underwritten by the pill was, on
    balance, a boon\r\nfor women, though it too came with downsides. The enthusiastic
    promotion\r\nof the pill by population control agencies, the medical establishment\r\nand
    the pharmaceutical industry - a tripartite cheer squad that\r\ncontinues to this
    day - led quickly to a view that all women were or\r\nshould be â\x80\x9Con itâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nThis
    has largely absented men from fiscal and social responsibility for\r\ncontraception
    and the consequences of unplanned pregnancies (bye-bye\r\nshotgun marriages),
    despite the persistence of unlawful abortion\r\n\r\nand the stigma of single motherhood.\r\n\r\nDrug
    companies arenâ\x80\x99t feminist organisations, nor deliberate drivers of\r\nradical
    social innovation designed to benefit women. They are\r\nbusinesses, seeking profits
    for shareholders through the creation and\r\nmarketing of pills that, ideally,
    we can be persuaded to ingest every\r\nday for much of our lives.\r\n\r\nThe anniversary
    of the contraceptive pill is indeed a time for\r\nreflection on the role of Big
    Pharma in our health and lives. Just\r\nremember what the aptly named band Public
    Enemy says: *Donâ\x80\x99t Believe the\r\nHype*."
