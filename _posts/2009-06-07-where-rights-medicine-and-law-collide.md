    and her boyfriend will face court because of it, charged with a\r\ncrime. If found
    guilty, the 19-year-old and her 21-year-old boyfriend\r\ncould get 10 yearsâ\x80\x99
    jail.\r\n\r\nThe names of the couple donâ\x80\x99t matter. They could be any one
    of us. The\r\nprosecution is taking place in Australia for the crime of abortion.\r\n\r\nThat
    in 2009 an Australian citizen can be found guilty of undertaking a\r\nmedical
    procedure and face jail is a scandal. A scandal that neither\r\npoliticians in
    Queensland (where this weekâ\x80\x99s prosecution will take\r\nplace) or in NSW
    (where a doctor was convicted of the crime of unlawful\r\nabortion in 2006) intend
    to do anything about. Not unless they are\r\nforced to take action by a resolute
    medical profession and ordinary folk\r\nlike you and me.\r\n\r\nAbortion is in
    the Crimes Act in both NSW and Queensland. The statutes\r\nare roughly similar,
    making it a crime for a woman to seek an abortion\r\nand for anyone else to help
    her procure one.\r\n\r\nThis is not the case elsewhere. In 2002 the ACT removed
    abortion from\r\nthe Crimes Act and last year Victoria did the same. Politicians
    in NSW\r\nand Queensland have been ignoring advice that they clarify, modernise\r\nand
    liberalise abortion law for years. This includes recommendations\r\nmade in a
    report by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and in a\r\nQueensland report
    on women and the criminal code.\r\n\r\nSome doctors have had enough. Respected
    Cairns gynaecologist Dr Caroline\r\nde Costa and her colleagues are now refusing
    to provide safe medical\r\nabortions to women for fear they, or their patients,
    will wind up in\r\njail. If other providers in Queensland, and across the border
    in NSW,\r\nare smart, they will follow suit. Because, as this weekâ\x80\x99s court
    case\r\nproves, whispered assurances by craven politicians that doctors have\r\nnothing
    to fear from antiquated, conservative and unclear laws are\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\nFor
    their own peace of mind and the long-term best interest of their\r\npatients,
    health-care workers must insist that politicians reform the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nDetermined
    and resolute doctors can compel reluctant politicians to act.\r\nThey have done
    it before. In 1998 in Western Australia abortion was in\r\nthe criminal code and
    two doctors were charged. Political leaders\r\ninsisted - in the face of obvious
    evidence to the contrary - that the\r\nlaw didnâ\x80\x99t need reform. But when
    providers at Perthâ\x80\x99s main hospital\r\ndowned tools, refusing to provide
    terminations in all but emergency\r\nsituations, and two women wound up in casualty
    from botched attempts to\r\nself-abort less than 48 hours later, the government
    was forced to act.\r\n\r\nDoctors canâ\x80\x99t be expected to agitate on their
    own. Striking doctors in\r\nWestern Australia had a multitude standing behind
    them. Supporters\r\nincluded courageous Labor, Liberal and minor party politicians,
    the AMA,\r\nfamily planning and legal advocacy organisations, progressive Christian\r\ngroups,
    a well-organised and dedicated group of grassroots activists and\r\nthe people
    of Western Australia, 82 per cent of whom told pollsters they\r\nthought abortion
    should be legal.\r\n\r\nSuch coalitions are only starting to form in NSW and Queensland.
    Only\r\ntime will tell if they will be successful.\r\n\r\nIf not, the other chance
    for law reform will be if the NSW Government\r\nlooks to history and makes a magnanimous
    gesture. If the Premier\r\nreferred the issue to the NSW Law Reform Commission,
    then acted on its\r\nrecommendations before the next election, women choosing
    abortion in NSW\r\nmight finally lose the â\x80\x9Ccriminalâ\x80\x9D tag."
