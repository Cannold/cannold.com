    Senator\r\nBarnaby Joyce. I hope heâ\x80\x99s telling the truth.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CAbout
    Tesltra?â\x80\x9D you might ask. Or Voluntary Student Unionism, where\r\nJoyce
    has sworn to vote against any Coalition bills that will reduce\r\nstudent services.
    Or perhaps you think Iâ\x80\x99m referring to Joyceâ\x80\x99s seeming\r\nwillingness
    to block some aspects of the governmentâ\x80\x99s proposed changes\r\nto industrial
    relations?\r\n\r\nNope, my thoughts are somewhere else, though any confusion could
    be\r\nforgiven. The extensive media coverage of Joyce (including somewhere\r\naround
    1297 articles since his election including at least 25 profiles)\r\nhas focused
    almost exclusively on Joyceâ\x80\x99s publicly stated position on\r\nthese issues
    to the exclusion of his repeated assertions on a subject of\r\nsimilar - if not
    greater - importance to the 50% of Australians not\r\ncurrently running the world.
    That subject is abortion.\r\n\r\nMy fervent hope - prayer really - that Joyce
    will be as good as his word\r\nrefers to the Senatorâ\x80\x99s hand-on-heart pledge
    that he would never\r\nhorse-trade his vote on other issues to secure concessions
    on abortion\r\nlaws or funding. Or so he told intrepid Fairfax journalist Misha\r\nSchubert
    who diligently relayed his comments in a recent news item\r\nmainly concerned
    with the recent scuttling by anti-choice MPs (Joyce\r\namongst them) of a routine
    parliamentary motion reaffirming Australiaâ\x80\x99s\r\nbacking for reproductive
    health services in developing nations.\r\n\r\nThose with a good grasp of recent
    political history will know why\r\nsupporters of reproductive choice are so anxious
    about Joyceâ\x80\x99s\r\nveritableness. They will remember the backroom deal struck
    by both major\r\npolitical parties with anti-choice Senator Brian Harradine in
    1996 to\r\nensure his vote for the partial privitisation of Telstra. In exchange,\r\nand
    to their eternal shame, both Labor and the Coalition voted with the\r\nTasmanian
    Senator to effectively ban Australian women from accessing a\r\ndrug called mifepristone
    or RU486 by requiring the Health Minister to\r\npersonally approve the importation,
    evaluation, registration and listing\r\nof the drug and to table that approval
    in parliament.\r\n\r\nOf course, the effective banning of mifepristone has not
    only denied\r\nwomen access to a safe effective non-surgical method of abortion
    able to\r\nbe used the moment an unwanted pregnancy is discovered (surgical\r\nterminations
    can not be done before the 5th or 6th week of pregnancy).\r\nIt has also led women
    needing emergency contraception with fewer\r\nside-effects, and women seeking
    an effective method of oestrogen-free\r\ncontraception to miss out. As well, the
    ban has left patients with\r\nbreast cancer, prostate cancer, inoperable meningiomas
    and Cushingâ\x80\x99s\r\nSyndrome in the lurch. Indeed, so important is mifepristone
    to\r\nAustralian patients in general, and female patients in particular, that\r\nthe
    Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and\r\nGynaecologists
    recently called on the government to review the drugâ\x80\x99s\r\navailability.
    A call the anti-choice Health Minister Tony Abbott seems\r\ndestined to ignore.
    Indeed, prior to Joyceâ\x80\x99s capitulation on Telstra,\r\ndefenders of reproductive
    freedom were aghast at the possibility that\r\nyet another Senator who preached
    justice and fairness would trade their\r\nvote on the telco for a policy outcome
    that ignores just those values\r\nwhere women are concerned.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    Harradine was a wily and experienced legislator who knew\r\nprecisely how to wield
    his power for the tiny communities he represented\r\nat the expense of the less
    ably-represented majority. But Joyce is no\r\ndolt either. At least not according
    to Professor Brian Costa, a\r\npolitical scientist at Swinburne, who describes
    him as a â\x80\x9Cquite\r\nwell-educated, articulate, smart operatorâ\x80\x9D.
    And Senator Joyce is firmly\r\nopposed to womenâ\x80\x99s reproductive freedom.
    Having told a Right to Life\r\nConference in July that his greatest goal in public
    life was to ban â\x80\x9Cthe\r\nunfortunate carnageâ\x80\x9D of abortion, he used
    his first speech in parliament\r\nto identify abortion as the â\x80\x9Cslavery
    debate of our timeâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nAnd while the full sale of Telstra is a done
    deal, the danger for\r\nAustralian women has not passed. Throughout the entire
    term of this\r\nHoward government Joyceâ\x80\x99s vote will be needed to achieve
    the\r\ngovernmentâ\x80\x99s legislative agenda. As each piece of legislation goes\r\nbefore
    the party room ~~- to ban compulsory student unionism,\r\nreconfigure industrial
    relations, revamp the tax system~~ Joyce will be\r\nthere, demanding a pound of
    flesh for his support.\r\n\r\nThe only question is whose flesh will be for sale?"
