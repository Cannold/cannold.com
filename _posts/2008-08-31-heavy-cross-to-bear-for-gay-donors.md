    disabled athletes to Beijing, but at least itâ\x80\x99s easy to ask your\r\ncolleagues

    Cain is a 26 year-old gay man living in Tasmania who has stuck\r\nhis head above
    the parapet to make a stand on an issue of equity and\r\njustice. But the battle
    Cainâ\x80\x99s picked is one that not only opens him to\r\nscorn and aggression
    because it reveals his sexual orientation, but of\r\naccusations that he is putting
    his own interests ahead of the public\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nNothing could be further
    from the truth.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, the Australian Red Cross Blood Service refused
    Michael Cainâ\x80\x99s\r\noffer to donate blood because he has sex with men. Cain
    thinks the\r\ngrounds for this refusal amount to unjust discrimination, and he
    has\r\ntaken his case to the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Tribunal. The\r\nquestion
    he wants the Red Cross to answer is simple. Why, given that he\r\npractises safe
    sex, wonâ\x80\x99t they let him donate, when the Red Cross leaves\r\nthe welcome
    light on for donors who are sexually promiscuous and never\r\ncome within coo-ee
    of a condom, as long as they are straight.\r\n\r\nIt doesnâ\x80\x99t make sense.
    Australia is widely acknowledged as having one of\r\nthe most intelligent and
    effective public health strategies to combat\r\nthe spread of the virus in the
    world. At the core of our policies is a\r\nconsistent and clear message about
    safe sex.\r\n\r\nThe risk of transmission of HIV/AIDS through the blood supply
    is\r\nnegligible, thanks to tests able to determine whether the virus is\r\npresent.
    To guard against the teeny, tiny risk that human error could\r\nsee infected blood
    mistakenly released into the blood supply, the Red\r\nCross tries to stop donors
    at risk of HIV/AIDS from holding out their\r\narm in the first place.\r\n\r\nWell
    and good, but the question is: who is at risk of catching HIV/AIDS?\r\n\r\nWhat
    public health experts have been telling us since the 1980s is that\r\nthose who
    have unsafe sex are at risk. What Cain wants the Red Cross to\r\ndo is screen
    out only those donors who practice unsafe sex, regardless\r\nof the gender of
    their sexual partners.\r\n\r\nIn a happy coincidence, screening policies based
    on the riskiness of\r\nsexual activity are both discrimination-free and effective.
    When Italy\r\nswitched from a screening policy based on the gender of the sexual\r\npartner
    to one focused on risky behaviours, their transmission rates of\r\nHIV through
    blood donation fell.\r\n\r\nUsing figures provided by one of the Red Crossâ\x80\x99s
    own witnesses, Cainâ\x80\x99s\r\nlegal team have shown that an Australian donor
    policy based on safety of\r\nsexual activity would see an HIV positive donation
    from a gay man slip\r\nthrough donor screening and clinical testing once every
    5769 years. In\r\nother words, never.\r\n\r\nDiscrimination on the basis of characteristics
    over which we have no\r\ncontrol, and which do not impact on our capacity to do
    the job, is\r\nalways wrong. The law does not, and should not, allow it.\r\n\r\nThe
    fact that when it comes to blood donation, doing the right thing may\r\nmake the
    blood supply safer, and more safe blood available, means change\r\ncanâ\x80\x99t
    come soon enough."
