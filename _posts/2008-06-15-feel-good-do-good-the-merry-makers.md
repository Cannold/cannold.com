    a flood. Even k.d. langâ\x80\x99s version of Hallelujah can do it. When\r\nthe
    face of the little fella in the Worksafe Victoria ad lights up\r\nbecause his
    Dad is safe and home, I break down in sobs.\r\n\r\nBut this week was a first.
    This week I saw a documentary so moving that\r\neven now, days later, the thought
    of it brings tears to my eyes.\r\nReviewing the trailer in preparation for writing
    this column, I broke\r\ndown again. Pushing my keyboard aside I put my head on
    the desk, and\r\nbawled.\r\n\r\nThe Music in Me, presented by that national treasure
    Andrew Denton,\r\nfeatures the Merry Makers, a troupe of intellectually and physically\r\ndisabled
    performers aged six to 56, and the two wonderful women-mother\r\nand daughter
    team, Janet and Lucinda, who have dedicated their lives to\r\nputting these dancers
    on stage.\r\n\r\nWhen the credits rolled I found myself pondering, tissue-box
    in lap, why\r\nthe Merry Makes tale is so inspiring. While articulate about all
    other\r\naspects of the troupe, neither Lucinda nor Janet could explain why-in\r\nJanetâ\x80\x99s
    words-a Merry Makersâ\x80\x99 performance â\x80\x9Cjust generates love and joy\r\nand
    happiness, and no one wants to go home.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nI think I know. Firstly,
    is because the Merry Makers replace disgrace\r\nwith pride. The film is unflinching
    in its exploration of the shame\r\nparents feel, or are made to feel by others,
    when a disabled child-one\r\nwith Downâ\x80\x99s syndrome or Fragile X or cerebral
    palsy-is born. â\x80\x9CI felt\r\nsick. My legs went to jelly. This canâ\x80\x99t
    be happening to me, sheâ\x80\x99s too\r\nbeautiful,â\x80\x9D recalls one mother.
    Another was told by her grandfather, as\r\nthe rest of her assembled family silently
    examined the new arrival,\r\nâ\x80\x9Cnothing like this ever happened in our family.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nBut
    the Merry Makers is about celebrating ability, not disability. In\r\ndoing so,
    it allows the parents of special children to experience what\r\nthe rest of us
    take for granted: set-piece moments where we are\r\npermitted to glory and gloat
    in our childrenâ\x80\x99s accomplishments, and\r\naccept the admiration of others
    for what they have achieved.\r\n\r\nThe climax of The Music in Me is the Merry
    Makersâ\x80\x99 2005 performance in\r\nthe Sydney Entertainment Centre alongside
    Marcia Hines, Todd McKenney\r\nand John Paul Young.\r\n\r\nWhen the Merry Makers
    take their bows to rapturous applause, you get the\r\nfeeling that this may be
    the first time in these peopleâ\x80\x99s lives where\r\nthey are the object of
    honest admiration and praise. When the camera\r\nfollows Merry Makers into the
    audience where they are hugged and\r\ncongratulated by ecstatic family members,
    you wonder if this is the\r\nfirst time these parents have been given permission
    to publicly revel in\r\ntheir childâ\x80\x99s accomplishments.\r\n\r\nA Merry
    Makers performance offers something unique to audiences, too. We\r\nlive in a
    world designed to make people with disabilities and those who\r\ncare for them
    invisible. When we do see the disabled and their carers,\r\nit is usually because
    something is wrong. Disabled people abused in\r\nspecialized accommodation or
    carers who lack respite care or are having\r\ntheir allowances slashed.\r\n\r\nThis
    near-exclusive representation of the disabled in the wider\r\ncommunity as those
    in plight, deserving our pity and rescue (and, in the\r\nevent we fail to provide
    either, our guilt) put paid to the â\x80\x9Clove, joy\r\nand happinessâ\x80\x9D
    offered by the Merry-Makers.\r\n\r\nFeel good, do good. It works for the Merry
    Makers and, so it seems for\r\nus, too."
