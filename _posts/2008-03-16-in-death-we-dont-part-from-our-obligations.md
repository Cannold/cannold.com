    after disputes about burial between non-indigenous and Maori\r\nrelatives. The
    distress of Ms Ngahooroâ\x80\x99s family was extensively covered\r\nin the New
    Zealand press, with the willâ\x80\x99s executor, niece Trish Scoble,\r\nsaying
    that the loss of the body made her feel both â\x80\x9Csickâ\x80\x9D and\r\nâ\x80\x9Cfrightenedâ\x80\x9D.
    Scoble said that she would not stop until her Auntie May\r\nwas laid to rest as
    she had wanted.\r\n\r\nThe body snatching cases raises interesting legal issues.
    One is that\r\nbecause New Zealand (like Australia) does not recognize bodies
    as\r\nproperty, the unauthorized removal of Ngahooroâ\x80\x99s remains did not\r\nconstitute
    theft or justify police intervention (though lawmakers in New\r\nZealand now appear
    ready to change this).\r\n\r\nThe moral issues are just as compelling. For some,
    the Auntie May case\r\nwas a storm in a teacup. Who cared where the woman was
    buried? Auntie\r\nMay wouldnâ\x80\x99t because she was dead.\r\n\r\nBut is it
    really that simple? Can we simply disregard the wishes of the\r\ndeceased? Or
    are there things we owe to the dead?\r\n\r\nMany moral thinkers, including Aristotle
    and Confucius, believed we did\r\nhave obligations to the dead. Every time we
    refuse to speak ill of them\r\nor work to carry out their last wishes or insist
    they get justice when\r\ntheir demise was the result of foul play, we strenuously
    agree.\r\n\r\nBut while we know that it would be wrong to override Dadâ\x80\x99s
    request to be\r\nan organ donor or for staff at the morgue to violate Mumâ\x80\x99s
    body, itâ\x80\x99s\r\nhard to explain why. After all, being dead, neither Dad
    nor Mum are\r\nlikely to care.\r\n\r\nBut the end of a body doesnâ\x80\x99t mean
    the end of a relationship. Just\r\nbecause my motherâ\x80\x99s dead doesnâ\x80\x99t
    mean sheâ\x80\x99s not my mother. So while the\r\nrelationship demands of the
    dead are few, what demands there are can be\r\nsaid to create obligations in the
    living.\r\n\r\nIn the same way that relationships carry forward beyond death,
    so too do\r\nthe interests of the dead person. Itâ\x80\x99s not hard to see why
    dead people\r\nwould maintain an interest in the fate of their body and organs,
    and the\r\nprotection of their memory, legacy and reputation. The law recognizes\r\nthese
    things by enforcing the terms of the deceasedâ\x80\x99s will.\r\n\r\nThe fact
    that the dead wonâ\x80\x99t know of our failure to protect their\r\ninterests
    doesnâ\x80\x99t mean those interests donâ\x80\x99t exist, and our failure\r\ndoesnâ\x80\x99t
    count. If you pledge fidelity to your partner when you marry,\r\nthen sleeping
    with someone else make you a cheat and causes your partner\r\nhurt, even if they
    never find out. And if you donâ\x80\x99t scatter Dadâ\x80\x99s ashes\r\nin the
    Blue Mountains like he asked, the fact that heâ\x80\x99ll never know\r\ndoesnâ\x80\x99t
    mean he wasnâ\x80\x99t harmed when you let him down.\r\n\r\nThe upshot? That even
    if the dead donâ\x80\x99t know weâ\x80\x99ve harmed them, they\r\nhave legitimate
    interests that can be harmed. These interests are ones\r\nthose of us bound by
    relationship to the dead are obligated to defend.\r\n\r\nOf course, many of the
    laws and customs surrounding death protect the\r\ninterests and wellbeing of the
    living, too. For instance, restrictions\r\non savaging the dead protect those
    who loved them from the helpless hurt\r\nof watching their memory and legacy tarnished.\r\n\r\nBut
    our obligations to the dead are stand-alone, too. Things we must do\r\nbecause
    despite the loss of their bodies, the dead are still people,\r\ntoo."
