    violence\r\nthat cost David Hookes his life.\r\n\r\nBut if early reports are correct,

    â\x80\x94 a woman who had been abused or\r\nslighted by someone in another group

    because he was defending\r\nanotherâ\x80\x99s honour.\r\n\r\nActing, you might
    say, like a good Samaritan.\r\n\r\nThe parable of the good Samaritan is usually
    seen as a biblical lesson\r\non the virtue of helping strangers. In fact, the
    tale - about a\r\nSamaritan who overlooks the longstanding and deeply felt enmity
    between\r\nSamaritans and Israelites to help a Jew in need - contends that earning\r\nGodâ\x80\x99s
    love requires us not just to put ourselves out for strangers, but\r\nalso for
    mortal foes. But what about loving yourself, or more precisely,\r\nbeing able
    to look at yourself in the mirror? What about making the\r\nworld the kind of
    place that you, and those you care about, want to live\r\nin: a place not just
    to survive, but to thrive?\r\n\r\nFor some, good Samaritans are fools: naive suckers
    or idiots lacking\r\ndiscretion who will surely, given enough time, get themselves
    hurt or\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nBut I see the Samaritan as righteous, even heroic.\r\n\r\nTo
    understand why, you need only picture a world in which neither the\r\nconcept
    nor reality of the good Samaritan exists. Sadly, this exercise\r\ndoesnâ\x80\x99t
    require imagination, just some historical recollection.\r\n\r\nIn 1964, Kitty
    Genovese, a waitress in her late 20s, was murdered on the\r\nstreets of a working-class
    suburb of Queens while 38 of her neighbours\r\nlistened, looked on, and even discussed
    among themselves the mayhem\r\nbelow, but did nothing to help - not even phone
    the police. The attack\r\nlasted for more than 30 minutes, the assailant fleeing
    and returning\r\nthree times - feeling unsatisfied, he later told the court, that
    he had\r\nnot finished what he set out to do. During the final phase, the attacker\r\nused
    the knife with which heâ\x80\x99d been stabbing Genovese to cut off her bra\r\nand
    underwear so he could rape her.\r\n\r\nFew of Genoveseâ\x80\x99s neighbours expressed
    regret for their inaction;\r\ninstead, they justified it by an unwillingness to
    â\x80\x9Cget involvedâ\x80\x9D.\r\nShocked, in pain and dazed by blood loss, one
    can only imagine what\r\nKitty Genovese felt in the final moments of her life.
    â\x80\x9CAloneâ\x80\x9D must\r\nsurely have been high on the list.\r\n\r\nGenoveseâ\x80\x99s
    death offered all New Yorkers a glimpse of what life would\r\nbecome - what they
    would become - in a world without the non-specific\r\ncaring and general decency
    of good Samaritans. Because when we give to\r\nanother person, not because they
    are our child or a friend, and not\r\nbecause we expect something back, but because
    they need our help, we\r\nmake that person live and matter in our eyes.\r\n\r\nNot
    only do we dignify them in this way, but we let them know they are\r\nnot alone,
    and in so doing, reduce our own sense of isolation, too.\r\n\r\nReaching for the
    good Samaritan in ourselves is about being all we can\r\nbe, instead of the least
    we can get away with; about moving towards a\r\nworld that trades on love, instead
    of fearfully shuffling backwards\r\ntowards the abyss.\r\n\r\nBut regardless of
    what prompted this weekâ\x80\x99s tragedy, to many, David\r\nHookes is already
    a hero. One of the paramedics who struggled to revive\r\nhim at the scene said
    as much.\r\n\r\nAn inspired player, incisive coach, and straight-shooting commentator,\r\nhis
    life was too short and unfairly taken. He will be missed."
