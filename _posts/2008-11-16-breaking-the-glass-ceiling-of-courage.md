    I found it hard to shed tears. These men were murderers and\r\ntears are evidence
    of compassion. My opposition to the death penalty is\r\nmotivated by more principled
    and practical concerns.\r\n\r\nMuch attention was paid in coverage of the story
    of the courage-or lack\r\nthereof-of one of the condemned men. Amrozi was described
    as â\x80\x9Cpale and\r\nafraidâ\x80\x9D and the â\x80\x9Cleast braveâ\x80\x9D
    of the three men. He was also, we were\r\ninformed, the â\x80\x9Cquickest to die.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s
    easy to read between the lines. The Bali Bombers were cowards. They\r\ntalked
    tough but when tested turned out to be piss weak. Barely men at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nSuch
    reportage dismays me. Firstly, because it wrongly suggests that the\r\nmurderous
    behaviour of religious fanatics is brave. Secondly, because it\r\nimplies that
    the absence of courag-or cowardice-is a particularly\r\ngrievous moral failing
    when seen in men.\r\n\r\nIs courage a particularly male virtue? My teenage son
    seems to think so.\r\nThe dictionary defines courage as the capacity to withstand
    pain, danger\r\nand uncertainty. Perhaps this is what he thinks he is doing when
    he\r\nleaves the house throughout the winter months in a thin collared shirt\r\nbecause
    the warm parts of the school uniform are â\x80\x9Cfor girls.â\x80\x9D He may\r\nalso
    think himself both male and brave when he returns from school with\r\na skateboard
    broken in two from some daredevil stunt performed before\r\nthe lunchtime crowd,
    then shares a smirk with this father when I worry\r\nthat it might have been his
    head. When he grows up, heâ\x80\x99ll probably\r\nrefuse to go the doctor. Just
    like dad.\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s all mindless peacock strutting in my view. Real
    courage is unisex,\r\na virtue of which both women and men are capable. To act
    with courage is\r\nto act after some deliberation in a manner consistent with
    what we\r\nbelieve, feel or know is right. Confronting a racist at a dinner party,\r\ndespite
    the risk of embarrassment, takes courage. Coming out as a\r\nlesbian, as a colleague
    of mine did recently, so that younger gays in\r\nher conservative profession would
    not feel so isolated takes courage. If\r\none is a homebody it takes courage to
    travel overseas and if one fears\r\ngetting hurt, falling in love is admirably
    brave. Former senator Linda\r\nKirk showed courage, with lashing of personal integrity,
    when she\r\nsupported stem-cell research and the removal of the Ministerial veto\r\nover
    RU486 despite Catholic elements of the Labor party warning her she\r\nwould lose
    her preselection. In her book on the subject, Maria Tumarkin\r\nreminds us of
    the courage of migrants, those who leave their language\r\nand culture behind
    to seek a better life for themselves and their\r\nchildren in the â\x80\x9Cruinous
    unknown.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nGender may play a small role in courage and its more
    impulsive cousin,\r\nheroism. Women learn to give their lives for their children.
    Men learn\r\nthat women, children and frail aged men come first. Mathematically,
    this\r\ngives men more people to protect, and so more opportunities to display\r\ncourage,
    when the bullets start flying.\r\n\r\nBut the gender connection with courage may
    be on its way out, if its not\r\npart of the past already. Women today are doctors
    and emergency service\r\nworkers, while men can be the primary carers of their
    kids. Using gender\r\nas a shorthand way of deciding who should be the hero in
    a modern crisis\r\nmay be past its use -by date."
