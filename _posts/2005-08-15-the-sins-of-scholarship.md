  content: "Few academics would have slept through the long-running Australian\r\nhistory
    wars. Sparked by claims made by retired academic Keith\r\nWindshuttle that several
    prominent scholars - among them Henry Reynolds\r\nand Lyndall Ryan - misrepresented
    or falsified data in order fabricate a\r\nversion of Aboriginal history consistent
    with pre-existing political\r\nagendas, the debate threw a sharp and very public
    spotlight on the\r\nfallibility of scholars and scholarly methods.\r\n\r\nReynolds
    and Ryan, as well as multiple and eminent defenders, have done\r\nwell to demolish
    the fabrication claim, and in doing so, provided the\r\npublic with a rare and
    fascinating glimpse into fractious disagreement\r\namongst historians about what
    constitutes valid historical method and\r\ninterpretive truth.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    less certainty surrounded the treatment of their errors of\r\nattribution and
    referencing. Errors that Windshuttle claimed were at the\r\nheart of his assault
    on the veracity of the two historiansâ\x80\x99 claims.\r\nEminent historian Stuart
    Macintyre, for example, saw Windshuttleâ\x80\x99s\r\nidentification of sources
    that did not â\x80\x9Csupport what the historians\r\nreported [and] others [that
    did] not even existâ\x80\x9D as â\x80\x9Cdamaging,â\x80\x9D while\r\nprize-winning
    historian Inga Clendinnen ultimately dismissed what she\r\ndescribed as Ryanâ\x80\x99s
    â\x80\x9Cmultiple and consequentialâ\x80\x9D referencing errors as\r\nâ\x80\x9Cfew,
    explicable and trivialâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Reynolds and Ryan are
    human. This means that like all\r\nacademics, it is likely they will err at some
    point in their career.\r\nThat this is the case doesnâ\x80\x99t necessarily make
    the consequences of such\r\nerrors less serious, but it does go to motive, and
    thus critically bears\r\non the way those mistakes should be judged and the legitimacy
    of\r\nproposed responses. The challenge for academics and those who judge them\r\n-
    usually other academics and the public at large - is to distinguish\r\nbetween
    honest mistakes, scholarly incompetence and various forms of\r\nacademic criminality.
    Interestingly, while questions of motive are at\r\nthe heart of public and institutional
    scrutiny of academic error, few\r\nprofessional codes or guidelines distinguish
    mistakes on the basis of\r\nintention or, indeed, anything else. Indeed, most
    discussions about\r\nproper academic conduct are addressed to students, with scholars
    seen as\r\nthe enforcers - never the violators - of accepted codes.\r\n\r\n**Honest
    Mistakes**\r\n\r\nThese are likely to be one-off errors, rather than part of a
    pattern.\r\nThey also seem more explicable by human fallibility (a momentary lack
    of\r\nconcentration, a transcription error in the publication process missed\r\nduring
    the proofing process) than a deliberate attempt to deceive. An\r\nexample might
    be a sole paragraph in an otherwise lengthy book lacking\r\nproper attribution
    by an academic with an otherwise unblemished record\r\nand a plausible story about
    how the footnote got lost.\r\n\r\nPunishment: None. The public shaming and unavoidable
    damage to\r\nreputation more than adequate.\r\n\r\n**Scholarly Incompetence**\r\n\r\nHere
    a pattern may exist (of paraphrasing without proper attribution or\r\nof footnotes
    referring to incorrect sources) but intention to steal, lie\r\nor otherwise deceive
    appears lacking. Instead, a plausible story can be\r\ntold of note-taking or attribution
    practices where such errors seem\r\nlikely, if not inevitable. Academics are culpable
    for failings resulting\r\nfrom incompetence because their consequences are damaging
    and\r\nunacceptable. However, such errors must be distinguished from those that\r\nresult
    from immoral motives.\r\n\r\nPunishment: None, but remediation (retraining, counseling)
    necessary.\r\n\r\n**Academic Criminality**\r\n\r\nMay be one-off, or part of a
    pattern of academic errors that includes\r\nplagiarism, falsification of experimental
    results or other data/sources\r\nand the use of knowingly false data to draw conclusions.
    Such\r\nwrongdoings may be compounded by the use of knowingly false results to\r\nearn
    rewards, like high-level publications or grants. What is shared by\r\nall academic
    acts of criminality is the intention by the scholar to\r\ncommit them, or a post-haste
    knowledge they were committed without an\r\nattempt to rectify the error.\r\n\r\nPunishment:
    In addition to shaming through exposure of the crime to\r\ncolleagues and the
    wider public, the academic criminal should be\r\nexpelled from the scholarly community,
    losing grants, jobs and other\r\npositions of respect and trust.\r\n\r\nThe bottom
    line is that not all academic mistakes are the same. Some are\r\nonly human, with
    sympathy and forgiveness the only legitimate response.\r\nBut when there is a
