    bills itself as a book in which Australian women\r\nâ\x80\x9Crevel their true

    experienced by todayâ\x80\x99s mothers.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the book is the
    myriad of womenâ\x80\x99s voices found on each\r\npage. Both celebrity and â\x80\x9Cordinaryâ\x80\x9D
    mothers confess their parental sins\r\nand doubts, and express their views on
    a wide range of maternal\r\nexperiences (mothering the â\x80\x9Cnot-so-perfectâ\x80\x9D
    child, the experience of\r\nbreastfeeding, maternal competitiveness in the playgroup).\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s
    not easy for women to admit theyâ\x80\x99ve found mothering unbearably\r\nboring,
    or that theyâ\x80\x99ve sometimes put their childâ\x80\x99s need second to their\r\nown,
    when such admissions can lead them to be labelled a â\x80\x9Cbadâ\x80\x9D mother.\r\nYet,
    69-year old Jean risks this by sharing her disappointment with her\r\nearly mothering
    experience. â\x80\x9CI can remember thinking,â\x80\x9D, she recounts,\r\nâ\x80\x9Câ\x80\x98If
    this is my life, my God, Iâ\x80\x99d rather be deadâ\x80\x99.â\x80\x9D Journalist
    Adele\r\nHorin take us into her confidence with her tale of sending a sick child\r\nto
    school so she could get to work, while presenter Joanna Griggs\r\nconfesses that
    she has the â\x80\x9Ctime of her lifeâ\x80\x9D when away from her\r\nchildren
    covering sport for Channel 7. As the authors rightly note,\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99s
    sharing of their maternal battle stories â\x80\x9Chas a curative power\r\nall
    of its ownâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nSadly, the rest of Motherguilt seems dedicated to
    wounding, rather than\r\nhealing. Instead of alleviating womenâ\x80\x99s guilt
    feelings about motherhood,\r\nit appears dedicated to affirming their current
    levels of moral angst,\r\nor even making them worse. For example, the authors
    assert without a\r\nshred of research evidence that contemporary mothers use abortion
    as\r\ncontraception, see babies as â\x80\x9Cfashion accessoriesâ\x80\x9D and,
    in failing to be\r\nrelaxed and happy mothers, deny their children the carefree
    childhood\r\nthat is their â\x80\x9Cinalienable rightâ\x80\x9D. Stay-at-home mothers
    are castigated\r\nfor giving up their professional careers and allowing their
    kidsâ\x80\x99 school\r\nlives to take on exaggerated importance, as well as providing
    a poor\r\nrole model to their children by helping them cheat on homework\r\nassignments.\r\n\r\nBut
    it is working mothers who really need to duck for cover. According\r\nto the authors,
    their reliance on prepared and fast foods coupled with\r\ntheir failure to serve
    up a family meal every night is the cause of\r\nincreased rates of childhood obesity;
    their busy lives and\r\ncompetitiveness causes stressed, depressed and ADHD kids
    who miss out on\r\ntime to â\x80\x9Cgaze at the clouds drifting by, watch a butterfly
    flit around\r\nthe garden or throw pebbles in a pondâ\x80\x9D; while their lack
    of time to\r\nlisten to their teenagers increases adolescent drinking and anorexia.\r\n\r\nSimilarly
    alarming â\x80\x9Cfactsâ\x80\x9D and accusations appear throughout the book,\r\nthough
    they must always be taken on faith as no sources - either in the\r\ntext or in
    notes - are provided.\r\n\r\nBut most disturbing are the authorsâ\x80\x99 conclusions
    about the causative\r\nrole contemporary mothers are playing in the downfall of
    the nationâ\x80\x99s\r\nchildren. This is Ita:\r\n\r\n> The growth in childrenâ\x80\x99s
    illnesses and mood disturbances has occurred\r\n> in line with mothersâ\x80\x99
    greater participation in the workforce. Could\r\n> this be coincidental? Can any
    intelligent woman seriously believe such\r\n> a thing without doubt of any kind?
    Surely it is impossible to overlook\r\n> something many mothers would prefer to
    close their eyes to - that\r\n> perhaps children have become the \\`victimsâ\x80\x99
    of the female ambition to\r\n> have it all.\r\n\r\nShe continues:\r\n\r\n> Many
    women got it wrong, and I include myself in this indictment. It\r\n> is all too
    obvious that children need more of their motherâ\x80\x99s time than\r\n> we have
    been able to give themâ\x80¦.Perhaps, most of all they need their\r\n> mums to
    be in less of a hurryâ\x80¦.If, as mothers, we need to feel guilty\r\n> about
    anything it is children. We have short-changed them. They have\r\n> been sending
    out signals for years now but we have preferred to be\r\n> blind to what has been
    going on.\r\n\r\nThis quote tidily encapsulates all that is wrong with Motherguilt.
    The\r\nunsupported alarmist claims; the uncritical acceptance of complex and\r\nheavily-freighted
    ideas like â\x80\x9Chaving it allâ\x80\x9D without any interrogation\r\nof the
    sexist 1950s norms they encode; the imputation that children need\r\nonly their
    mothers and the corresponding silence about father-absence\r\nand its impact on
    womenâ\x80\x99s work and guilt-loads as well as children; the\r\nfirm yet tautological
    claim that the one thing mothers should feel\r\nguilty about is children (what
    else would women feel motherguilt about?)\r\n\r\nA recent letter to the Australian
    Book Review noted that â\x80\x9Ceven a badly\r\nwritten book has cost the author
    blood and sweatâ\x80\x9D. It was not a plea for\r\nmerciful reviewing, but could
    be read as one, and as a non-fiction\r\nwriter myself, I am sensitive to the harm
    done by a bad review.\r\n\r\nBut whatever compassion I feel for the authors, I
    feel much more for\r\ntheir potential female readership. Indeed, I feel obligated
    to do what I\r\ncan to warn women of the disconnect between what this book promises
    and\r\nwhat it delivers.\r\n\r\nBecause I just canâ\x80\x99t bear the thought
    of a young mother - anxious,\r\ninsecure, perhaps even teetering on the edge of
    depression - wandering\r\ninto her local bookshop in search of something that
    might help her to\r\nunderstand her situation better and lift her spirits, leaving
    instead\r\nwith a load of Motherguilt."
