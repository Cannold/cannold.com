  content: "I caught up with a girlfriend in New York recently. She gave me a rundown
    on the lives of those with whom we'd gone to school. \"She's divorced\", was a
    description attached to many, though I was struck by the implicit judgment that
    came with my friend's sad face and sigh. As if divorce was evidence of a failure
    of character and proof of a life lived less well. \r\n\r\nTell that to my two
    friends â\x80\x93 both mothers of daughters â\x80\x93 who left their emotionally
    abusive husbands the minute these men began belittling the girls. As one of friends
    put it: \"How could I tell my daughter she deserved better than that when I stayed
    and let him do it to me?\" \r\n\r\nThe reasons we look down on divorce are not
    just historically outdated, they call on moral values that are behind the times
    too. \r\n\r\nJesus' prohibition on divorce is a touchpoint for those who live
    in Christian cultures, but the historical context for these views gives them an
    entirely different flavour. \r\n\r\nTwo thousand years ago in Israel, men could
    set their wives aside unilaterally and with ease (women had no right to divorce).
    Without a man's name or protection, the divorced woman and her children were unseen
    by God and so shunned by men, unable to make their way economically and at risk
    of being cast out beyond the city walls. Jesus' attempt to limit men's freedom
    to leave their wives â\x80\x93 radically feminist for the time â\x80\x93 offered
    women an unprecedented degree of marital and social security. \r\n\r\nBut with
    the historical justification of the prohibition lost in time and women's relatively
    newfound social and economic independence meaning they no longer have to rely
    on marriage for their social and economic survival, why does the stigma surrounding
    divorce persist? \r\n\r\nThink of a person you consider morally virtuous. Would
    you describe them as brave? Honest? As good as their word? What about someone
    who practises self-denial not necessarily to benefit others but because she believes
    it makes her more godly? \r\n\r\nFew Australians would include asceticism in their
    list of moral virtues, yet this seems to be the source of the admiration expressed
    for those who persist in loveless marriages, even after the kids are gone. \"They
    stuck it out\", I've heard it said, as if the endurance of suffering and the sacrifice
    of one's potential for happiness is â\x80\x93 in and of itself â\x80\x93 a righteous
    act. \r\n\r\nSuch self-flagellatory morality becomes even more bizarre when we
    consider how long we are condemning ourselves, and others, to suffer.\r\n\r\nJust
    over 100 years ago, most of us died in our 50s. Access to contraception was limited,
    as was the effectiveness of available methods. This meant that by the time a woman
    was through bearing and raising the last of her kids, she had a few years at most
    with her husband before both of them passed on. \r\n\r\nNow, most of us can expect
    to live well into our 80s, giving us about 30 years of life beyond the structure
    provided by education, partnering and parenting. \r\n\r\nInstead of additional
    time in marital purgatory, these extra 30 years should be seen as a chance to
    turn the \"you only live once\" adage on its head â\x80\x93 at least when it comes
    to romantic partnerships. \r\n\r\nWhat may be required during our nearly 90 years
    on earth is not one romantic partnership, but three. This is to match the three
    distinct stages of contemporary life. \r\n\r\nIn the first stage, spanning the
    late teens and 20s, we need a partner who helps us discover who we are and will
    nourish us as we get an education and begin the task of earning a living. \r\n\r\nThe
    second stage requires a person with whom we want to have and raise children. \r\n\r\nThe
    third stage provides the miraculous opportunity for us to pull together all we
    know â\x80\x93 who we are and what we want â\x80\x93 and, with a bit more money
    and wisdom behind us, to search for a partner who truly touches our soul. \r\n\r\nFar
    from being a disaster, the possibility of late-life divorce makes me dizzy with
    possibility and crazy with gratitude. If I'd been born in nearly any other time
    but now â\x80\x93 or in another part of the world at any time â\x80\x94 I would
    have had to settle for what I chose the first time around. Because I didn't know
    enough to choose wisely, I would have gone to my grave never having had the chance
    to find a man who could receive the love I was now capable of giving and who could
    love me the way I now understand I need to be loved back. \r\n\r\nThe take-home
    is simple. Marriage can be heaven or hell, and if yours is making you miserable,
    get out. You're not too old and you're not too fat. What you are is blessed to
    live in a place and at a time when you get a second chance. And as the American
    baseballer Pete Rose once said: \"If somebody is gracious enough to give me a
    second chance, I won't need a third.\""
