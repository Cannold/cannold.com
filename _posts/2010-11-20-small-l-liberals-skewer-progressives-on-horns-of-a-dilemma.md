    not conservative?\r\n\r\nIn the wake of the chess-like analysis of the Victorian
    Liberalsâ\x80\x99\r\ndecision to preference Labor before the Greens in next Saturdayâ\x80\x99s
    state\r\nelection, Victorians voters must now confront their own tactical\r\nconundrum.
    In particular, the quandary facing those who take a\r\nprogressive line on issues
    such as abortion, physician-assisted dying,\r\nstem cell research, artistic censorship
    and multiculturalism.\r\n\r\nSuch voters face a hard choice. They can vote for
    Ted Baillieu, who is\r\nprogressive on all these issues, or, by not doing so,
    risk confining him\r\nand his small-l brand of liberalism to historyâ\x80\x99s
    dustbin.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement: Story continues below\\\r\nMembers of the Liberal
    Party share a radically individualistic, socially\r\nconservative economic agenda.
    But, just like Labor, they splinter on\r\nissues of individual rights, equality
    and the role religious beliefs\r\nshould have in shaping the laws that govern
    us.\r\n\r\nThe fall of federal Liberal leader Malcolm Turnbull to the sword of
    a\r\nman colleagues have dubbed Captain Catholic has arguably left Baillieu\r\nthe
    last small-l Liberal leader across the nation. If he loses next\r\nweekend, it
    wonâ\x80\x99t just finish him as Leader of the Opposition but may\r\nalso spell
    the end of small-l liberalism in Australia.\r\n\r\nWho cares? To quote a tweet
    from feminist cartoonist Judy Horacek, many\r\nof the progressive voters who share
    Baillieuâ\x80\x99s stance on matters of\r\nindividual freedom, equality, diversity
    and the secular state would â\x80\x9Cno\r\nmore vote Liberal than flyâ\x80\x9D.
    Why should they care who leads the party,\r\nnow or in the future, or whether
    liberal or conservative brands of\r\nLiberals are elected to Parliament?\r\n\r\nWell,
    they should care for the simple reason that the stance of the\r\nLiberals determines
    the tone, tenor and parameters of debate on\r\nprogressive issues. Where numbers
    are tight or a conscience vote will\r\ndetermine the outcome, the number of small-l
    Liberal votes in the\r\nchamber will determine whether progressive policy falters
    or thrives.\r\n\r\nA progressive stance from the Liberals enhances the power of
    the\r\nprogressive wing of the Labor Party while a conservative opposition\r\nemboldens
    its conservative religionists to frustrate change and advance\r\ntheir illiberal
    agenda.\r\n\r\nThe abortion debate in the state in 2008 is a case in point. As
    former\r\nVictorian premier Joan Kirner has acknowledged, Baillieu played an\r\nimportant
    role in the success of the decriminalisation push. He made his\r\nintention to
    vote for reform early in the piece, and each time\r\nconservative religious Liberals
    sought to derail the process, he put\r\nthem in their place. When Peter Costello
    tried to stir up community\r\ndisquiet about the legislation, Baillieu did what
    is all to too rare in\r\nthe male-dominated world of politics: he kept faith with
    his small-l\r\nLiberal principles even when it came to women. He told The Age
    that\r\nwomen deserved to be free to choose to have an abortion â\x80\x9Cwithout
    fear of\r\nunwarranted persecution, prosecution or stigmaâ\x80\x9D, and added:
    â\x80\x9CItâ\x80\x99s time\r\nto provide some certainty, and for the women of
    Victoria this is a very\r\nimportant [time].â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nOne has only to look
    at the inaction on law reform in Queensland and New\r\nSouth Wales - states lumbered
    with the same antiquated and unclear\r\ncriminal provisions on abortion that reigned
    in Victoria - to recognise\r\nthe key role of a small-l Liberal opposition.\r\n\r\nEven
    in Queensland, where last month a young woman and her boyfriend\r\nwere charged
    and tried for the crime of abortion (a jury found them not\r\nguilty), there is
    no political will to repeal criminal provisions that\r\nhark back to 1861. The
    reason? In Queensland, the Liberals, in coalition\r\nwith the Nationals, have
    a highly religious conservative bent and have\r\njoined forces with those of similar
    persuasion in Queensland Labor to\r\nstymie change.\r\n\r\nBaillieu is not progressive
    on every issue (although itâ\x80\x99s easy for him\r\nto appear this way when
    his federal counterparts continue to move - to\r\nquote former prime minister
    Malcolm Fraser - â\x80\x9Cfurther and further to the\r\nrightâ\x80\x9D). He is
    against gay marriage, a stance that undercuts his usual\r\ncommitment to equity
    and diversity. But John Brumby opposes gay\r\nmarriage, too. Unlike the Premier,
    Baillieu supports physician-assisted\r\ndying, an issue likely to occupy the attention
    of the new Victorian\r\nParliament if the Greens have their way.\r\n\r\nSo where
    does that leave Victorians who want to act in a principled\r\nfashion, but also
    tactically and with an eye to the future, when casting\r\ntheir vote?\r\n\r\nI
    think anyone who wants Victoria to remain the most sane and\r\nforward-looking
    state in the nation, anyone who wants the Liberal Party\r\nto remain a party of
    liberalism - not religious conservatism - has to\r\nlook hard at Baillieuâ\x80\x99s
    Liberals this time around because the stark\r\ntruth is that unless a small-l
    Liberal opposition can win its way\r\nthrough to government - and soon - there
    wonâ\x80\x99t be any small-l Liberals\r\nleft."
