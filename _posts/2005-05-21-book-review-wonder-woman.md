    to read Virginia Haussegger, or to listen to her on radio - as\r\nshe has been
    in the last week, plugging Wonder Woman - and not find\r\nyourself liking her.
    In particular, I admire her honesty. Since 2002,\r\nwhen she threw open the doors
    on her reproductive journey and its\r\nunwanted destination, Haussegger has never
    been anything less than\r\nforthright about the pain she feels over finding herself
    unintentionally\r\nchildless.\r\n\r\nHausseggerâ\x80\x99s ongoing personal journey
    both structures and animates\r\nWonder Woman. In it, Haussegger tries to make
    sense of the â\x80\x9Ccreeping\r\nnon-choicesâ\x80\x9D that led to the moment
    in the doctorâ\x80\x99s surgery where she\r\nwas briskly told sheâ\x80\x99d left
    her run to motherhood too late. The book\r\nalso represents the authorâ\x80\x99s
    working through of her grief about missing\r\nout on motherhood, and her efforts
    to reconstruct a new imagined future,\r\nand identity, for herself as a woman
    without children.\r\n\r\nHaussegger writes movingly of the events leading up to
    the opinion piece\r\nthat shook the world (then-Opinion editor Paul Austin nominated
    it as\r\nthe piece published in recent years that generated the most response),\r\nand
    about the distress that can be found in unexpected places when\r\nlife-long habits,
    like the carting of carefully labelled boxes full of\r\njournals and photos from
    city to city, are recognised as having been\r\ngeared towards children who arenâ\x80\x99t
    to be. Writes Haussegger:\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CWhen I was very young I was entranced
    by the few old photos we had of\r\nmy mother and father when they were youngâ\x80¦I
    desperately wanted to know\r\nwhat my mother was like when she was littleâ\x80¦The
    fading photos gave some\r\nclues, as did the precious jewellery box my mother
    kept hidden\r\nawayâ\x80¦Every piece held a story, every story I would demand
    to hear over\r\nand over againâ\x80¦Now at forty years old, Iâ\x80\x99ve built
    up a box of treasures\r\nof my own. I just donâ\x80\x99t know who to show them
    toâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nI cried at this line, which comes near the bookâ\x80\x99s
    end. The cleanness of\r\nthe emotion a welcome relief from the turbulent confusion
    engendered by\r\nthe preceding (and subsequent, as it turned out) text. Because
    while\r\nHaussegger it a wonderful raconteur, and demonstrates a clear gift for\r\nexploring
    emotions - her own and, through interview, those of others -\r\nshe desperately
    lacks any capacity to think her way out of the complex\r\nproblems she explores
    in Wonder Woman. Despite having read most seminal\r\nand popular feminist texts
    - from the Second Sex to the Female Eunich to\r\nBacklash - she clearly failed
    to absorb their central and most important\r\nmessage: that the personal is political.
    And without this understanding,\r\nor some structural framework to make sense
    of her experience and those\r\nof other women in terms other than those proffered
    by liberal\r\nindividualism, Haussegger lacks the tools to extricate herself from
    the\r\ncircular path of self-blame and DIY solutions that have characterised\r\nher
    journey, and to cut a clear path forward for her female readers.\r\n\r\nThis is
    not to say that she does not, on rare occasions, allude to such\r\npolitics and
    their potential for womenâ\x80\x99s liberation. Having begun the\r\nbook with
    her familiar refrain that itâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9Chigh time to re-think\r\nfeminismâ\x80\x99s
    messages and the \\`have it allâ\x80\x99 mantra thatâ\x80\x99s been thumped\r\ninto
    the brains and parlance of post-feminist womenâ\x80\x9D, Haussegger then\r\ntentatively
    contradicts the implications of this claim - that feminism\r\nneeds a less ambitious
    message - with a one-line assertion that\r\nâ\x80\x9Cencourag[ing] young women
    to lessen their expectations, rather than\r\nraise them by demanding more equity
    and support, is doomedâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nBut this theme quickly drops away, only
    to be briefly and somewhat\r\nincoherently resurrected in the bookâ\x80\x99s last
    few pages (Iâ\x80\x99m afraid I have\r\nno idea what the approvingly quoted Nicola
    Roxon means when she asserts\r\nthat contemporary feminists must fight â\x80\x9Cto
    be ourselvesâ\x80\x9D).\r\n\r\nAnd so we are left with the bizarre hypothesis
    that the real problem\r\nfacing contemporary women is that feminists didnâ\x80\x99t
    tell them they\r\ncouldnâ\x80\x99t have it all, rather than the fact that even
    in post-feminist\r\ntimes, they still canâ\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nThe job of articulating
    this obvious truth was left to Shadow Health\r\nMinister Julia Gillard who launched
    the book at the National Press Club\r\nearly this month. Gillard spoke eloquently
    of the need to move â\x80\x9Cbeyond\r\nthe lamentâ\x80\x9D and to â\x80\x9Cgo
    forward, to carve out more change and to do what\r\nwe need to do now so [that
    the life of girls] is more full of real\r\nchoice than that of todayâ\x80\x99s
    woman.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nYou said it, sister. The question is: why didnâ\x80\x99t
