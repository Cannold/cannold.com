  content: "Why do some women hate others who use Botox and other ''liquid'' facelift
    techniques but give men who use the stuff a free pass?\r\n\r\nWe like to think
    of ourselves as individuals and the decisions we make about how we keep our skin,
    hair and body as based on personal preferences but the truth is more complex than
    that. In fact, what an individual comes to consider de rigueur on her personal
    grooming ''to do'' list is the outcome of complex social processes taking place
    in the wider society and her personal social group.\r\n\r\nTake body weight. Studies
    show that women judge their body weight by reference to cultural and fashion models
    with whom they identify and - more importantly - by the immediate social group.
    If the icons and peers with whom they identify are larger women, then they deem
    a larger body to be ''normal'' and feel fine about it.\r\n\r\nIn the same way,
    the collective influences the judgments individuals make about what constitutes
    ''ageing gracefully'' and ''letting oneself go''. Nearly all the middle-class,
    educated women I know dye their hair, apply face cream and wear make-up. The mantra
    is that 50 is the new 40 and, from what I observe, this means that women broaching
    50 don't just want to feel 10 years younger - they want to look it, too.\r\n\r\nSome
    find this easier to achieve than others. For those without genetics on their side,
    cosmetic interventions such as Botox and injectable skin fillers can help.\r\n\r\nBut
    while women in my social milieu speak openly about their next root-dyeing appointment,
    few admit to getting their Botox topped up. Indeed, as one cosmetic nurse told
    me, gift certificates that her surgery donated to a private school charity auction
    for facial fillers were passed in without a single bid, despite many women in
    the room being clients of the practice.\r\n\r\nWhere's there's silence, you'll
    often find shame and the shame surrounding surgical and liquid cosmetic interventions
    in Australia is legion.\r\n\r\nBut who's peddling it, and why?\r\n\r\nRadical
    feminists - and their Christian pseudo-feminist cousins - blame men. As one angry
    young woman put it in response to a piece I wrote on the issue several years ago:
    ''Women get plastic surgery, as well as spend endless time and money on all of
    the other beauty practices listed, because men require us to â\x80¦ Men invent
    new and higher standards of beauty for us to live up to because they need new
    and different ways of knowing that we're still playing the game.''\r\n\r\nMy experience
    is that the shaming and silencing around Botox has nothing to do with men and
    everything to do with other women. Not the vast majority of women - who are lovely
    to one another and respectful of each other's hang-ups, shortcomings and choices
    - but two sub-groups of the pursed-lipped I'll call '''the holier-than-thou''
    and ''the controlling wenches''.\r\n\r\n**The holier-than-thou\r\n**\r\nIt's hard
    to take this subspecies seriously. First, because the ''men make us do it'' argument
    is so factually flawed. It is estimated that one-third of wrinkle-reduction procedures
    are done on men, which suggests that consumerism - not sexism - is a key driver
    of demand.\r\n\r\nSecond, because holier-than-thou politics are so hopelessly
    â\x80¦ unpolitical. If it is true that social forces - not individual choices
    - are piloting women's decisions to undertake cosmetic surgery, then it seems
    hopelessly regressive to shame individual women from abstaining as a means of
    effecting global changes to female behaviour.\r\n\r\n**The controlling wenches\r\n**Despite
    the name, I have a fair bit of sympathy for this lot. As the use of cosmetic surgical
    interventions becomes the norm, expectations of what a ''typical'' 50-year-old
    looks like are changing, too.\r\n\r\nFrom a situation where a woman who chooses
    to use cosmetic interventions may be lauded for looking ''great for her age'',
    we may be arriving at a place where a more youthful appearance is expected. Women
    who choose not to intervene may no longer be seen as ''ageing gracefully'' but
    instead be viewed as looking ''old'', or even judged for ''letting themselves
    go''.\r\n\r\nThis is why the wench snaps at the heels of women who admit to using
    injectables in an attempt to slow or halt the changes to social norms resulting
    from the collective consequences of individual decisions that increasingly ''normalise''
    such use.\r\n\r\nSo why do some women have a problem with others who use Botox,
    but no issues with men? Because we are social creatures and compare ourselves
    to other women, not men.\r\n\r\nAnd - as is the way with social phenomenon - it
    is the decisions some women are making to add liquid facelift procedures to their
    grooming regime that is changing the nature and types of choices available to
    others."
