  content: "BREASTFEEDING: what could be more simple? Best for mother, best for\r\nbaby,
    the obvious and necessary feeding choice for all mums, and the\r\nonly one ethical
    health professionals can support. Most women reading\r\nthis would find such \"factsâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99
    familiar.\r\n\r\nThe gut-wrenching feelings of guilt and inadequacy that accompany
    such\r\npronouncements might also feel familiar. Because when it comes to\r\nbreastfeeding,
    most of us feel like failures: either because we didnâ\x80\x99t\r\ntry to or didnâ\x80\x99t
    succeed at breast-feeding our babies, or we fear we\r\ndidnâ\x80\x99t feed for
    long enough.\r\n\r\nWomen are consistently told that the nutritional superiority
    of breast\r\nmilk makes breastfeeding the only \\`\\`choiceâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99
    for any mother who really\r\ncares about her baby. To ensure the maximum number
    of women \\`\\`chooseâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\nbreastfeeding, public health officials,
    health professionals and\r\nbreastfeeding advocates see themselves as justified
    in doing whatever it\r\ntakes to \\`\\`supportâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99 breastfeeding
    and to \\`\\`actively discourageâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\nformula feeding.\r\n\r\nWomen
    may decide not to initiate or to continue breastfeeding for a\r\nrange of reasons.
    They may not feel comfortable exposing their breast in\r\npublic, they may \\`\\`failâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99
    because of supply problems or mastitis, or\r\nthey may have had enough after three
    or four months and want to hand\r\nover primary care to Dad.\r\n\r\nThe bar that
    todayâ\x80\x99s \\`\\`successfulâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99 breastfeeders must leap is\r\nconsiderably
    higher than that needing to be vaulted by previous\r\ngenerations. Twenty years
    ago, breastfeeding was recommended for three\r\nmonths. Soon after target was
    set at six months. Now the World Health\r\nOrganisation says all women (regardless
    of where they live and the\r\nadequacy of alternative food supplies) should breastfeed
    \\`\\`into the\r\nsecond year and beyondâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99. Accordingly, many
    Australian researchers have\r\nbegun pushing the government to adopt one-year
    targets.\r\n\r\nThe benefits claimed for breastfeeding are also on the rise, although\r\nadvocates
    consistently fail to disclose the significant controversies\r\namong researchers
    about whether such benefits exist and whether they are\r\ncaused (or just correlated)
    with breastfeeding. Selective reporting of\r\nresearch findings is also rife.\r\n\r\nMy
    favorite is a recent study that showed that while breastfeeding\r\nlowered breast
    cancer rates in pre-menopausal women, it appeared to\r\nraise the incidence of
    breast cancer in post-menopausal women. Youâ\x80\x99ll\r\nfind the former finding
    in the fact sheets distributed by the La Leche\r\nLeague; the latter is strangely
    absent.\r\n\r\nBut the biggest problem is that breastfeeding advocates confuse\r\ndecisions
    about breast milk with decisions about breastfeeding. Even\r\nwomen who have no
    doubts that breast milk is nutritionally superior to\r\nformula may make an informed
    and caring decision that, in their\r\nsituation, breastfeeding is not the best
    choice.\r\n\r\nThis is because women donâ\x80\x99t base infant-feeding decisions
    only on the\r\nrespective qualities of the milk, but also on the costs and benefits
    of\r\neach feeding method to their infant, their other children, themselves,\r\ntheir
    partners and their family as a whole. For example, a woman may\r\nweigh up the
    \\`\\`riskâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 to her infant of giving some formula at three\r\nmonths
    so she can return to her full-time job, against that of losing\r\nher job altogether
    or falling out of the loop because of the extensive\r\namount of time needed during
    the work day to express milk. Not only\r\nmight the woman value her job as an
    important source of self-esteem and\r\nfinancial independence, her income may
    be essential to the familyâ\x80\x99s\r\nmeeting its commitments to a mortgage
    or private school.\r\n\r\nWhen a woman makes a decision according to her own values
    about how she\r\nis going to feed her infant, this decision merits support and
    respect\r\nregardless of what it is. For this to happen, a number of policies,\r\npractices
    and attitudes are going to need to change.\r\n\r\nThe first is the accuracy of
    the information disseminated to women about\r\nbreast and formula feeding. Such
    information needs to distinguish\r\nbetween infant milk (breast and formula) and
    infant-feeding decisions.\r\nIt must also either reveal all the confusing and
    contradictory findings\r\nand debates about the relative merits of breast milk
    and formula, or\r\nreport only those findings about which there is little disagreement.\r\n\r\nThere
    also needs to be changes in workplace structure and attitudes to\r\nenable women
    who want to breastfeed to do so for as long as they wish\r\nwithout fear of losing
    their job. Extended paid parental leave is the\r\nmost critical of these, but
    proper workplace facilities in which women\r\ncan take adequate nursing breaks
    during the day are also important.\r\n\r\nBut such changes do not mean all women
    will choose to initiate\r\nbreastfeeding or to feed for extended periods of time.
    Health officials\r\nand professionals who believe it would be unethical to support
    anything\r\nbut breastfeeding must seriously rethink the meaning of ethical and\r\nprofessional
    behavior when it comes to caring for new mothers. It is\r\nunethical for health
    professionals to use their considerable power and\r\nauthority to coerce (subtly
    or otherwise) competent and informed women\r\nto make decisions that accord with
    the health professionalâ\x80\x99s view of\r\nwhat is right.\r\n\r\nIt is even
    more unethical for such professionals to refuse to respect,\r\nto withdraw support
    from, or seek to undermine womenâ\x80\x99s decisions they\r\ndeem \\`\\`wrongâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99.
    Their moral and professional responsibility is to help\r\nwomen understand the
    information women see as relevant to their\r\ndecision, and then to respect womenâ\x80\x99s
    capacity as competent informed\r\nadults to make the best decision for them.\r\n\r\nAh,
    respect for female autonomy and moral agency. What could be more\r\nsimple?"
