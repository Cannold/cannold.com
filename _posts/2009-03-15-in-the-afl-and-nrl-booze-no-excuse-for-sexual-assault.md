    chief executive David Gallop\r\nblamed alcohol again when standing Stewart down.\r\n\r\nWeakness
    and ill discipline do not cause sexual assault. Retrograde\r\nattitudes about
    women and the acceptability of violence do. While the\r\nstrain on the careers
    and reputations of the accused are a concern,\r\nsurely anyone counting the costs
    of sexual violence should mention\r\nwomen, too. Alcohol loosens inhibitions,
    but unless you are the kind of\r\nbloke who is barely containing an urge to punch
    a woman, or force her to\r\nhave sex, too much drink wonâ\x80\x99t make you a
    danger to anyone.\r\n\r\nThe real source of sexual violence in male sporting codes
    is the\r\nattitudes many elites athletes have about women and sex, and their sense\r\nof
    entitlement to both. These attitudes are shared and perpetuated by\r\nthe men
    who advise, coach, treat and manage players.\r\n\r\nMale sporting culture is much
    as it ever was. Young, alpha-males with an\r\nover-inflated sense of their own
    importance and capacities being swarmed\r\nat every opportunity by fawning women
    keen to add a notch to their belt\r\nby bedding a star.\r\n\r\nWhat has changed
    is the attitudes women, and some sections of society,\r\nhave about the legitimacy
    and limits of such engagements. Once such\r\nwomen might have been labeled groupies
    or whores looking to bolster a\r\nflagging sense of self-esteem or bag a husband
    through calculated\r\ndispersal of sexual favours.\r\n\r\nNow women who put themselves
    in the way of footy or rugby players\r\nhave-or feel they ought to have-the same
    sense of entitlement to sexual\r\ngratification as men. They are not floozies
    or victims, but modern girls\r\npursuing sexual satisfaction on mutually agreed
    terms.\r\n\r\nThis conceptualization, one seemingly lost on the far-from-modern
    boys\r\nwho permeate every layer of the macho-male leagues, explains why women\r\nare
    quick to cry foul when what they understand as the new sexual\r\ncontract between
    the genders is violated.\r\n\r\nA fish rots from the head down. Those who mentor
    and manage elite male\r\nathletes are role models to the next generation of players.
    These men\r\nneed to take a good, hard look at themselves. Sexual politics are\r\ncomplicated
    and this is a new world. Itâ\x80\x99s about attitude, not booze.\r\nItâ\x80\x99s
