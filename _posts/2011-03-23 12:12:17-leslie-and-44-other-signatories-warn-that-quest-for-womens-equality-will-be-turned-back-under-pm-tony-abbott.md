title: "Leslie and 44 Other Signatories Warn That Quest for Womenâ\x80\x99s Equality
  Will Be Turned Back Under PM Tony Abbott"
---
The gender divide in support for Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott is
significant. Media analysis views it as women supporting a woman. This
sidesteps the real concerns women have about Abbott’s views and past
policies.

Tony Abbott wants to take divorce laws back to the 1970s, with an idea
that aggrieved spouses could be required to prove offences like
adultery, habitual drunkenness or cruelty to be granted a divorce.

Abbott blocked Australian women’s access to RU486 because he opposes
legal abortion. He has said Christian politicians cannot check their
faith into the parliamentary cloakroom.

His musings on female virginity and premarital sex are also troubling.
He needs to reassure Australian women that Parliament is not the place
to impose religious rules or beliefs.

Abbott’s views and past policies have and will continue to give rise to
policies that undermine the respect and equality women have fought so
hard to achieve.

Women may be unsure how far Julia Gillard wants to move us forward, but
we know that Abbott will take us back.

We don’t care that Abbott has religious beliefs. But we have good reason
to worry that should he become PM, he will impose his religious values
on us.
