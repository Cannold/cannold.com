    living in poverty and catastrophic levels of violence in some\r\nindigenous communities.
    These are just some current issues of national\r\nimportance that most Australians
    would see as legitimate topics for\r\ndebate.\r\n\r\nSadly, the womb watchers
    think otherwise.\r\n\r\nIt is no secret that former Prime Minister Howard gave
    unprecedented\r\nlicense to the Christian fundamentalists in his party to use
    Australian\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99s fertility decisions as a means of wedging and distracting
    the\r\ncommunity. Single women with the temerity to want a child, and divorced\r\nmothers
    dependent on the dole to raise one were the Governmentâ\x80\x99s\r\nfavourite
    whipping girls.\r\n\r\nWhen Howard fell, taking with him his incendiary choice
    of Health\r\nMinister Tony Abbott - a.k.a. the \\`mad monkâ\x80\x99 - many sighed
    with relief.\r\nSurely the Ministerial appointments of Julia Gillard and Nicola
    Roxon,\r\nand the elevation of former AMA President Brendan Nelson to Opposition\r\nleader
    signalled the demise of womb-watching as a national sport, and\r\nthe re-assertion
    of the commonsense belief that women and their partners\r\nhave the right to decide
    if and when they bear children.\r\n\r\nBut the view that the new Federal landscape
    represents a new dawn in\r\nfertility politics is about to be tested. On 18 June,
    Tasmanian Liberal\r\nSenator Guy Barnett gave notice of plans to table a motion
    in parliament\r\nthat would make women more than 14 weeks pregnant undergoing
    labour for\r\nan â\x80\x9Cintrauterine fetal death, gross fetal abnormality or
    life\r\nthreatening maternal diseaseâ\x80\x9D pay for the procedure themselves.
    Medicare\r\nfunding, just for these women undertaking just this procedure, would
    no\r\nlonger be available.\r\n\r\nSo what if a woman has a dead fetus festering
    in her womb, or one\r\naffected by what Barnett himself describes as a â\x80\x9Ccommon
    disabilities\r\nsuch as Down syndrome and spina bifida.â\x80\x9D Who cares if
    her condition puts\r\nher life at risk? Where do such women get off thinking they
    not only\r\nhave a right to such medical care, but to have Medicare fund it? If
    Guy\r\nBarnett, a self-described man of â\x80\x9Cconscience,â\x80\x9D has his
    way, such feral\r\nfeminists will be coming down off that high horse, and quick.\r\n\r\nThe
    issue will come to a vote in September. Whether, and how strenuously\r\nhis Liberal
    and Labor colleagues will say much about the future of\r\nwomb-watching in this
    country.\r\n\r\nWill Brendan Nelson maintain his long-held view that exiting Medicare\r\narrangements
    must stay in place to avoid backyard abortion, or will he\r\nsquib - as he did
    earlier this month when it came to lifting the ban on\r\nforeign aid paying for
    abortion - in a fruitless attempt to please the\r\npartyâ\x80\x99s right wing?
    Will Deputy PM Gillard and Health Minister Nicola\r\nRoxon, two women whose hearts
    are clearly in the right place on this\r\nissue stand up and be counted - both
    behind the scenes and in front of\r\nthe cameras - or will their ambition get
    in the way?\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99ve heard that when Barnett declared his intentions
    in the party room,\r\nmost of his colleagues rolled their eyes. Not just because
    most\r\nLiberals-like most members of the ALP and 81% of Australians-support the\r\nright
    of individuals to decide, but because they are sick to death of\r\ndiscussing
    abortion.\r\n\r\nGuy Barnett, if you donâ\x80\x99t want to have an abortion, itâ\x80\x99s
    OK. You donâ\x80\x99t\r\nhave to have one. Now, can you get out of the conversational
    way so the\r\nrest of the nation can discuss the issues that really matter."
