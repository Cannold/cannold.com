title: Letters Page, The Australian, RU486
---
What woman would want to have an unsafe, illegal abortion when she could
have a safe and legal one? Health minister Tony Abbott (Opinion, 6/2)
claims to be worried that making RU486 available in Australia would lead
to backyard miscarriages and an internet-based black market.

Yet Australian history tells us that making abortion illegal doesnâ€™t
stop women having abortions, it just increases the risks they take doing
so. If he really wanted to avoid backyard abortion and a black markert
internet trade, the minister should do all he can to ensure medical
abortion with RU486 is done in the front yard. He and his colleagues
should vote yes so that the drug can be properly evaluated and
regulated.
