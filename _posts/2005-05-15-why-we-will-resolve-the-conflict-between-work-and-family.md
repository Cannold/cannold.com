    life\r\n\r\nIf debate on this page over the last few weeks has made anything clear,\r\nit
    is that motherhood has driven a red-hot stake through the heart of\r\nthe sisterhood
    - if such a thing ever existed in the first place. Equal\r\npay for equal work,
    more funding for womenâ\x80\x99s diseases like breast\r\ncancer, tougher sentences
    for rapists: on these things most women agree.\r\nBut as Naomi Wolf discovered
    during her jaunt through Australiaâ\x80\x99s\r\ncapital cities last week, mention
    motherhood and the claws come out.\r\n\r\nYet despite the difficulties women and
    the womenâ\x80\x99s movement have talking\r\nabout motherhood - or more precisely
    the nature of the conflict mothers\r\nexperience between work and family and how
    it should be resolved - it\r\nremains an issue of major issue concern for contemporary
    women. Not just\r\nwomen who already have children, but the 92% of young women
    who want to\r\nhave them, as well as a steady partner and career, in the future.\r\n\r\nFeminists
    have been the ones who have identified womenâ\x80\x99s unhappiness\r\nabout work/family
    imbalance and the main ones to suggest solutions to\r\nthe problem, yet the womenâ\x80\x99s
    movement is unlikely to ever muster the\r\npolitical muscle to compel change.
    This is because the transformations\r\nrequired - no less than the structural
    reorganisation of paid employment\r\nand an increasingly globalised economy -
    are too major, and the forces\r\narrayed against such change too powerful.\r\n\r\nYet
    change will come. Indeed, profound changes in the size and makeup of\r\nAustraliaâ\x80\x99s
    population that are already underway make it inevitable.\r\n\r\nAustralian women
    now have on average only 1.73 children each, a\r\nfertility rate far below the
    2.1 children per woman needed for steady\r\npopulation growth. And according to
    the ABS, the rapid dive of our\r\nfertility rate is set to continue. On one estimate,
    it will fall to 1.3\r\nby 2008. During this time, our already rapidly aging population
    will\r\ncontinue to age. Indeed, by 2051 the ABS predicts there will be three\r\ntimes
    as many Australians aged 65 to 84, and half the number of\r\nchildren, than was
    the case in 1971.\r\n\r\nWhat this means is that as the children of the largest
    generation weâ\x80\x99ve\r\nhad in quite some time, the Baby-Boomers, make their
    way from their\r\ncurrent starting positions in the labour force to the positions
    of power\r\ntheir parents and those from Generation X now occupy, there will be\r\nincreasingly
    smaller pools of applicants from which to select their\r\nreplacements. Sure,
    business will do as it currently does today, compete\r\nlike mad for skilled migrants
    to make up the difference, but given the\r\nlow fertility scenario is happening
    across the western world, Australian\r\nbusiness is unlikely to be successful
    enough to significantly relieve\r\nthe skilled labour shortage.\r\n\r\nThis is
    when things will get interesting. Because - unlike today -\r\nemployers will no
    longer have the luxury to say, favour a childless\r\napplicant or a man with a
    full-time wife at home over a working mother\r\nto fill a given vacancy, the current
    practice of marginalizing workers -\r\nmostly mothers - who canâ\x80\x99t arrive
    at 7:00 in the morning and put in\r\nface-time until 8:00 at night will end. As
    is always the case when\r\nlabour is short, workers will have far more control
    than they do\r\ncurrently over their conditions of employment.\r\n\r\nSome will
    no doubt make the trade that global capitalism favours:\r\nexchanging increased
    productivity (read: more time every week at work)\r\nfor higher wages. But I suspect
    many more will bargain for what is\r\nalready and will continue to be the scarcest
    commodity in contemporary\r\nlife - time. Along with their secure career-track
    jobs, these workers\r\nwill demand capped time, fractional time, flexible time,
    work-at-home\r\ntime and time to go visit their kids on the days the other parent
    -\r\ndemanding the same conditions - is not at home with them at the\r\nsubsidised
    work-place based cr&egrave;che. And it wonâ\x80\x99t just be working\r\nmothers
    demanding such conditions, it will be dads, too. Because if\r\nthere is one way
    in which feminism has changed the world, it is in\r\nchanging menâ\x80\x99s beliefs
    not only about womenâ\x80\x99s right to paid employment,\r\nbut their own responsibility
    to share in the work of running a household\r\nand raising the kids.\r\n\r\nEmpty
    nesters wanting time to help care for their grandkids, childless\r\nworkers wishing
    to donate quality time to a cherished social cause or\r\nhobby, the unemployed.
    All these groups, as well as parents, will\r\nbenefit from the long overdue reversal
    of global capitalismâ\x80\x99s relentless\r\npush towards the â\x80\x9Cdownsizingâ\x80\x9D
    that means little more in their day-to-day\r\nlives than more time at the office
    doing two jobs instead of one. In the\r\nnew world, it is more likely that two
    jobs will be shared between two\r\nand one half people, or even three.\r\n\r\nRapidly
    declining fertility rates not only indicate the unhappiness of\r\ncontemporary
    women and men with work/family imbalance, it points to the\r\nway the problem
    will be solved.\r\n\r\nAnd I for one, canâ\x80\x99t wait."
