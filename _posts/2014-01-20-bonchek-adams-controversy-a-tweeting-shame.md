  content: "*Now is the time for informed debate on patient choices.*\n\nThe Lisa
    Bonchek Adams tweet story is a morality tale, but not one about patient choices
    at the end of life. Bonchek Adams is a blogger and tweeter living with metastatic
    breast cancer. Her condition can be treated but not cured. A woman in her 40s
    with three children at home, she has pursued medical care that both extends her
    life and improves its quality.\n\nShe has been living with her diagnosis for years
    and while the condition will likely end her life, her final days could be months
    or years away.\nLate-stage cancer is tricky, and the progression of each patient's
    disease is different. \n\nWith the time left to her, Bonchek Adams has chosen
    to do ''as much as I can for as long as I can''.\n\nShe is one of a growing group
    of patients using social media to share their experience of breast cancer diagnosis,
    treatments and - for those who do not recover - their last weeks and months on
    earth.\n\nNothing controversial. Or so you would think. For some patients, sharing
    their story with followers, and receiving support in return, reduces the isolation
    and shame that can accompany the illness. This is especially the case, as writer
    Zeynep Tufecki put it, when their journey does not ''fit into happy narratives
    of survivors showered in pink paraphernalia''.\n\nFor followers who are not comfortable
    with this way of coping, there is no compulsion to participate. But this was not
    the decision made by husband and wife columnists Emma and Bill Keller. In a piece
    in The Guardian, Emma Keller uses Bonchek Adams' tweets as a jumping off point
    for ruminations about the rectitude of ''dying out loud''.\n\nIn his regular column
    in The New York Times four days later Bill used Bonchek Adams' medical situation
    (she was in hospital for radiation treatment and pain caused by tumours on her
    spine) as a hook to discuss the wisdom of ''heroic measures that may or may not
    prolong life''. \n\nThe social media backlash was fast and furious. In subsequent
    days, it was joined by bloggers and columnists who expanded on the myriad ways
    the Kellers got it wrong. In response, The Guardian removed Emma's comments ''pending
    investigation'', and Times editor Margaret Sullivan made rare and pointed comments
    about factual errors and tonal problems with Bill's piece.\n\nBoth journalists
    have a case to answer. Emma Keller exchanged emails with Bonchek Adams, and quoted
    direct messages she was sent on Twitter, without disclosing to Bonchek Adams she
    was writing a column. Both Emma and Bill got important facts wrong, the most critical
    of which was their presumption that Lisa is near death.\n\nAs an academic who
    has followed Lisa for a year says: ''Lisa Adams is not prolonging her last few
    weeks of life with a cascade of interventions. She's getting treatment for pain
    in her bones - the type of tumours that won't kill her till they spread elsewhere,
    which may be soon, or may be years away.''\n\nOr as Lisa herself reprimanded Bill
    from her hospital bed: ''@nytkeller The main thing is that I am alive. Do not
    write me off and make statements about how my life ends TIL IT DOES, SIR.''\n\nAmong
    the many regrettable aspects of this incident is the loss of the opportunity to
    have a conversation about patient choices at the end of life that Bill Keller
    clearly wanted to have, but his and his wife's misuse of Bonchek Adams' story
    cut short.\n\nAcross the Western world, populations are ageing. Enormous amounts
    of resources are spent on aggressive and invasive care of elderly patients in
    the final months of their lives. Most patients in dialysis programs and intensive-care
    units are aged over 70 and many are already burdened with serious chronic illness.\n\nWhen
    patients are still able to make decisions for themselves, they may not realise
    a current illness heralds the end of life. When they lose the capacity to decide
    for themselves, their families will determine whether each additional intervention
    is worth the cost, or only postpones the inevitable.\n\nReligious values and defensive
    medical behaviour can shape the choices doctors make, but families racked by grief,
    in dispute with one another, or suspicious of the system, also block compassionate
    care. The result, says one doctor, is a loved one condemned to ''die in isolation,
    pain and fear'' in hospitals and intensive-care units rather than comfortably
    at home.\n\nPart of the solution is advanced care planning, which allows patients
    to clarify their values by discussing them with their family and doctor. A written
    plan makes sure their wishes are understood and designates a trusted person to
    carry them out.\n\nThe Bonchek Adams story is a timely reminder of how profoundly
    technology has reshaped our world. It was never acceptable for journalists to
    mislead sources, make sloppy errors of fact or misappropriate someone's personal
    tragedy. But the web's capacity to connect readers to one another enables knowledge
    of such professional misdemeanours to be shared, while collective outrage works
    the levers of power to ensure violators are called to account.\n\nSadly, advancing
    medical technology can disempower the average punter at the end of life. She must
    make her wishes known to avoid a cascade of distressing medical interventions
    that do not save life but merely prolong death.\n"
