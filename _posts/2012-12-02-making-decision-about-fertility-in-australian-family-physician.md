    countries have been below two children per woman for the past 3 decades. The reasons
    behind womenâ\x80\x99s childbearing behaviour are complex. However, a lack of
    awareness regarding the consequences of delayed childbearing and the inability
    of reproductive technologies to overcome the â\x80\x98biological clockâ\x80\x99
    may be contributory factors.\r\n\r\n**Objective**\r\nA narrative review guided
    by the research question: What do women need to know about the consequences of
    delayed childbearing in order to make informed decisions about their fertility?\r\n\r\n**Discussion**\r\nThere
    are three facts that women need to know in order to make informed decisions around
    their fertility: Some women want to have more children than they are able to have
    because they postpone childbearing; there can be medical consequences to delaying
    childbearing and; some womenâ\x80\x99s ideas about their fertility donâ\x80\x99t
    match the â\x80\x98the scientific factsâ\x80\x99. General practitioners are well
    placed to play a strategic role in the provision of timely, relevant information
    to help women make informed decisions about their fertility. Further research
    is needed to identify the most appropriate ways for GPs to communicate this information.\r\n\r\nAverage
    annual fertility rates in almost all industrialised countries have been below
    two children per woman for the past 3 decades.1 Such sustained low fertility can
    be associated with complex social, economic and population management issues as
    the population ages. More importantly, the rates may be less an expression of
    â\x80\x98what women want when it comes to motherhood and more of a reflection
    of what women are gettingâ\x80\x99.2\r\n\r\nLow fertility rates can result from
    women progressively postponing the first time they give birth. Such postponement
    may be due to aspirations for education, career and financial security; the challenges
    women face in finding and securing care arrangements (whether in heterosexual,
    gay/lesbian or single parent families); and the effect of experiences of first
    pregnancy, physical infertility, and poor pregnancy outcomes on future fertility.
    In practical terms, postponement increases the age of first motherhood, reducing
    the remaining time in which women can have a child and increasing their likelihood
    of ending up childless, or with fewer children than they wanted and planned to
    have. The recent trend in delayed childbearing, and consequent overall reduced
    fertility, has led to what is often called an â\x80\x98epidemic of pregnancy in
    middle ageâ\x80\x99.3 This has been observed among women in many parts of the
    developed world, including the United States,4 Canada,5 Europe6 and Australia.7
    Of significant concern is that women may be delaying their first pregnancy without
    knowing or understanding the consequences of this decision on their future fertility.\r\n\r\nThis
    article, focusing on the Australian setting, argues that there are three critical
    facts that women need to know in order to make informed decisions around their
    fertility.\r\n\r\nSome women want to have more children than they are able to
    have because they postpone childbearing\r\nThere can be medical consequences to
    delaying childbearing\r\nSome womenâ\x80\x99s ideas about their fertility donâ\x80\x99t
    match the â\x80\x98scientific factsâ\x80\x99.\r\nIn presenting these facts, we
    highlight gaps in the research that require further investigation. Currently,
    much of the evidence about the â\x80\x98chosenâ\x80\x99 nature of womenâ\x80\x99s
    fertility comes from population based studies. Little is known about how women
    conceptualise their fertility journey, what they understand about the opportunities
    and limits of their fertility, and how they react emotionally and practically
    to final fertility outcomes that differ from the maternity desires and intentions
    they had at the start of their childbearing years.\r\n\r\nGeneral practitioners
    are well placed to play a strategic role in the provision of this information
    (Table 1). Incontrovertibly, womenâ\x80\x99s decision to delay childbearing is
    often influenced by wider sociopolitical contexts and debates around patient autonomy
    and reproductive rights. It is important that GPs acknowledge these contexts when
    aiming to communicate the facts to women patients. Some GPs may feel that this
    role is not within their ambit. However, we argue that it is necessary for women
    to have all the available information in order to make informed decisions about
    their fertility and that GPs are in an ideal position to provide this information.\r\n\r\nTable
    1. The strategic role of GPs in providing fertility information\r\nEach year,
    Australian GPs consult with 86% of the population38 and 3.6 of every 100 consultations
    between GPs and patients involves contraception management39\r\n\r\nGPs are often
    the first point-of-contact for an infertile couple and play an important role
    in referral, ordering further tests, and ensuring individuals receive appropriate
    and timely fertility care40\r\n\r\nBuilding on their existing relationship with
    patients, GPs have an opportunity during a wide range of consultations (eg. during
    routine Pap tests, health check-ups, and contraceptive consultations) to gain
    an understanding of their patientsâ\x80\x99 short and long term reproductive goals\r\n\r\nBy
    engaging in positive family planning and taking a patient centred approach, GPs
    can offer relevant â\x80\x98fertility factsâ\x80\x9941 to patients as part of
    their responsibility to assist the patient to make informed decisions\r\n\r\nFurther
    research is needed to identify the most appropriate way for GPs to deliver these
    fertility facts without sounding condescending or patronising\r\n\r\nFact 1: Some
    women want to have more children than they are able to have because they postpone
    childbearing\r\nLow fertility rates are a consequence of some women having no
    children and others having fewer children. Research suggests that many women have
    clear aspirations by their late teens or early 20s with regard to future parenthood.2,8
    The Australian Longitudinal Study on Womenâ\x80\x99s Health found that over 85%
    of young women aged 18â\x80\x9323 years aspired to be married, have one child
    and be in paid employment by the age of 35 years.9 This finding confirms earlier
    work10 which found that only 6â\x80\x938% of Australian women aspire to childlessness.
    There is, however, a significant gap between the number of children women tell
    researchers they want, and the number they achieve. This gap between fertility
    aspirations and fertility attainment has led to predictions that in Australia,
    up to a quarter of women will end their fertile years childless.11 Such realities
    suggest that â\x80\x98choiceâ\x80\x99 and infertility may not be the only factors
    affecting womenâ\x80\x99s reproductive outcomes. Importantly, the sustained low
    fertility rates in industrialised countries may be partly explained by circumstances
    that constrain womenâ\x80\x99s freedom to mother at all, or to have as many children
    as they plan and desire.2\r\n\r\nThe factors behind contemporary womenâ\x80\x99s
    childbearing behaviour are multifactorial and complex.12 Contributing factors
    include effective contraception, liberalised abortion laws, womenâ\x80\x99s increased
    involvement and commitment to the workforce and a desire to achieve both financial
    security and a suitable partner before parenting. The result is that increasing
    numbers of women in Western countries are delaying their first pregnancy until
    around age 30 years.7,13 In 1998, just under a third of Australian women aged
    30 years or over had their first birth; 2011 data from the Australian Institute
    of Health and Welfare14 indicates this proportion has increased to over 54%, with
    23% of all firstchild births occurring in women aged 35 years and over.\r\n\r\nFact
    2: There can be medical consequences to delaying childbearing\r\nFemale fertility
    declines with increasing age. Age related fertility problems increase after 35
    years and significantly after 40 years.3 Pregnancies in older women are more likely
    to result in adverse outcomes such as stillbirth, miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy15
    as well as multiple births and congenital malformations.16 Pregnancies in women
    aged over 40 years are also associated with more nonsevere complications, premature
    births and interventions at birth.17 Women over the age of 35 years have an increased
    risk of specific fetal abnormalities, including structural18 and chromosomal19
    abnormalities. While some tests are noninvasive, others require invasive techniques
    that are associated with an additional miscarriage risk.20\r\n\r\nIncreasing numbers
    of women are using assisted reproductive technology (ART) to improve their conception
    outcomes. The average age of Australian women using ART to achieve a pregnancy
    has risen from 31 years in 1993 to just under 34 years in 2009, and one in 4 women
    have used ART by 40 years of age.21 However, some younger women may not realise
    that ART cannot entirely or reliably compensate for the decline in fecundity associated
    with age and delayed attempts at conceiving.17 For women over 30 years of age
    using ART, each additional year in age was associated with an 11% reduction in
    the likelihood of achieving pregnancy and a 13% reduction in the chance of a live
    delivery.22 In addition, the stress related to fertility treatment may discourage,
    and ultimately deter, women and their partners from further attempts at conception.23\r\n\r\nFact
    3: Some womenâ\x80\x99s ideas about their fertility donâ\x80\x99t match the â\x80\x98scientific
    factsâ\x80\x99\r\nResearch has shown that women are ill informed about the relationship
    between age and infertility. An Australian study of women aged over 35 years seeking
    ART found that 18% were unaware of the impact of age on fertility.7 Similarly,
    in the USA, 88% of women overestimated by 5â\x80\x9310 years the age at which
    fertility begins to decline24 while in Sweden, researchers found that university
    students planned to have children at ages when female fertility is decreased without
    being sufficiently aware of the age related decline in fertility.25\r\n\r\nIn
    addition, women may be misinformed about the ability of ART to overcome the â\x80\x98biological
    clockâ\x80\x99 and its efficacy more generally and may overestimate their chance
    of having a baby by using these techniques.26,27 Weston and colleagues10 found
    that 60% of men and women believed that they or their partners were likely, or
    very likely, to conceive if they used in vitro fertilisation (IVF) with only 8%
    saying success was unlikely. They also found that despite the declining live birth
    rate from IVF with increasing age, those aged in their late 30s were just as likely
    as those in their 20s or early 30s to be optimistic about their ability to have
    a child using IVF techniques.10 This suggests that people of childbearing age
    may be unaware of the importance of the female and male partnerâ\x80\x99s age
    in determining the chance of having an IVF baby and may see it as a fallback option.28\r\n\r\nWomen
    may also have limited knowledge of the association between fetal abnormality and
    increasing maternal age,29 as well as the role of prenatal testing for the fetal
    abnormalities associated with maternal age.29 One study found that while nearly
    all women had heard of Down syndrome, less than half were aware that the condition
    involved intellectual disability.30\r\n\r\nPatient autonomy, informed decision
    making and reproductive rights\r\nPatient autonomy, or â\x80\x98self ruleâ\x80\x99,
    is a key, if not an overriding consideration in contemporary medical practice
    and medical law.31,32 An autonomous patient is one who is able to make voluntary
    and informed decisions about their healthcare.32,33 Fostering patient autonomy
    is a key objective of ethical medical care, a responsibility that includes an
    obligation on the part of medical practitioners to ensure that their patients
    obtain an understanding of all relevant information so that they may participate
    in, and make informed choices about, their healthcare. Where fertility is concerned,
    the principle of autonomy dictates that women have a right to know and understand
    their fertile body.34 This requires medical professionals to assist their patients
    to develop an adequately sophisticated understanding of their fertility and its
    limits so that they can make reproductive health decisions consistent with their
    short and long term fertility life plans. The World Health Organization identifies
    sexual and reproductive health as a human right and a priority that should be
    promoted through woman centred care in comprehensive primary care settings.35\r\n\r\nWith
    this in mind, some have advocated intervention by GPs calling for â\x80\x98positive
    family planningâ\x80\x99.36 Bachrach36 argues that when a childless woman comes
    for a health check-up or for contraceptive advice or prescription, GPs should
    use the opportunity to refresh the womanâ\x80\x99s understanding of her reproductive
    lifespan, discuss her plans regarding childbearing and make contraceptive and
    other recommendations commensurate with those plans. However, others argue that
    positive family planning approaches are inconsistent with a GPâ\x80\x99s ethical
    obligation to promote patient autonomy, and that where reproductive information
    giving is perceived as encouragement by GPs for female patients to get pregnant
    at a younger age, it would be paternalistic and â\x80\x98politically incorrectâ\x80\x99.24\r\n\r\nSome
    research suggests that GPs may be unwilling to participate in these types of discussions
    with patients.37 However, little is known about whether GPs are undertaking such
    interventions, their capacity to do this work, the obstacles to effective and
    ethical communication on such sensitive issues and whether such efforts would
    be welcomed by, and prove informative to, patients. More research into this important
    area is needed (Table 2).\r\n\r\nTable 2. Areas for further research by population

    effects of implementing positive family planning in general practice\r\nBarriers
    and enablers to implementing positive family planning in general practice\r\nPerceptions
    by patients of GPs delivering positive family planning\r\nSummary\r\nMedical professionals
    and society in general should support women to achieve their individual reproductive
    goals, whether those goals include a desire for many children or none at all.
    While there are many socioeconomic factors that influence womenâ\x80\x99s reproductive
    decision making, lack of appropriate knowledge about age related decline in fertility
    and the inability of reproductive technologies to overcome diminished fecundity
    in later life may be contributory factors. By informing women of the gap between
    fertility desires and reproductive outcomes, the medical consequences of delayed
    childbearing, and the discrepancy between lay knowledge and current scientific
    knowledge of age related fertility issues, primary care providers are promoting
    informed decision making as a means of fostering patient autonomy. However, GPs
    and other primary care providers may perceive imparting this information as paternalistic
    or overstepping professional boundaries.\r\n\r\nLimited research has been undertaken
    in this area and there is need to investigate how best to provide this information
    to women (ie. via individual or public health-type approaches). Research should
    also be directed at understanding how GPs and primary care providers perceive
    discussions with female patients around childbearing and fertility intentions
    and how decisions to delay childbearing affect family structure and womenâ\x80\x99s
    physical and mental health. Only then can evidence based supports be implemented
    to better enable women to achieve their fertility goals. Irrespective of the particular
    reproductive outcome for any given woman, medicine has an important role to play
    in ensuring womenâ\x80\x99s fertility outcomes are a matter of choice, not chance.\r\n\r\nConflict

    the population ages. More importantly, the rates may be less an expression of
    â\x80\x98what women want when it comes to motherhood and more of a reflection
    of what women are gettingâ\x80\x99.2</p>\n\n<p>Low fertility rates can result
    from women progressively postponing the first time they give birth. Such postponement
    may be due to aspirations for education, career and financial security; the challenges
    women face in finding and securing care arrangements (whether in heterosexual,
    gay/lesbian or single parent families); and the effect of experiences of first
    pregnancy, physical infertility, and poor pregnancy outcomes on future fertility.
    In practical terms, postponement increases the age of first motherhood, reducing
    the remaining time in which women can have a child and increasing their likelihood
    of ending up childless, or with fewer children than they wanted and planned to
    have. The recent trend in delayed childbearing, and consequent overall reduced
    fertility, has led to what is often called an â\x80\x98epidemic of pregnancy in
    middle ageâ\x80\x99.3 This has been observed among women in many parts of the
    developed world, including the United States,4 Canada,5 Europe6 and Australia.7
    Of significant concern is that women may be delaying their first pregnancy without
    knowing or understanding the consequences of this decision on their future fertility.</p>\n\n<p>This
    article, focusing on the Australian setting, argues that there are three critical
    facts that women need to know in order to make informed decisions around their
    fertility.</p>\n\n<p>Some women want to have more children than they are able
    to have because they postpone childbearing\nThere can be medical consequences
    to delaying childbearing\nSome womenâ\x80\x99s ideas about their fertility donâ\x80\x99t
    match the â\x80\x98scientific factsâ\x80\x99.\nIn presenting these facts, we highlight
    gaps in the research that require further investigation. Currently, much of the
    evidence about the â\x80\x98chosenâ\x80\x99 nature of womenâ\x80\x99s fertility
    comes from population based studies. Little is known about how women conceptualise
    their fertility journey, what they understand about the opportunities and limits
    of their fertility, and how they react emotionally and practically to final fertility
    outcomes that differ from the maternity desires and intentions they had at the
    start of their childbearing years.</p>\n\n<p>General practitioners are well placed
    to play a strategic role in the provision of this information (Table 1). Incontrovertibly,
    womenâ\x80\x99s decision to delay childbearing is often influenced by wider sociopolitical
    contexts and debates around patient autonomy and reproductive rights. It is important
    that GPs acknowledge these contexts when aiming to communicate the facts to women
    patients. Some GPs may feel that this role is not within their ambit. However,
    we argue that it is necessary for women to have all the available information
    in order to make informed decisions about their fertility and that GPs are in
    an ideal position to provide this information.</p>\n\n<p>Table 1. The strategic
    role of GPs in providing fertility information\nEach year, Australian GPs consult
    with 86% of the population38 and 3.6 of every 100 consultations between GPs and
    patients involves contraception management39</p>\n\n<p>GPs are often the first
    point-of-contact for an infertile couple and play an important role in referral,
    ordering further tests, and ensuring individuals receive appropriate and timely
    fertility care40</p>\n\n<p>Building on their existing relationship with patients,
    GPs have an opportunity during a wide range of consultations (eg. during routine
    Pap tests, health check-ups, and contraceptive consultations) to gain an understanding
    of their patientsâ\x80\x99 short and long term reproductive goals</p>\n\n<p>By
    engaging in positive family planning and taking a patient centred approach, GPs
    can offer relevant â\x80\x98fertility factsâ\x80\x9941 to patients as part of
    their responsibility to assist the patient to make informed decisions</p>\n\n<p>Further
    research is needed to identify the most appropriate way for GPs to deliver these
    fertility facts without sounding condescending or patronising</p>\n\n<p>Fact 1:
    Some women want to have more children than they are able to have because they
    postpone childbearing\nLow fertility rates are a consequence of some women having
    no children and others having fewer children. Research suggests that many women
    have clear aspirations by their late teens or early 20s with regard to future
    parenthood.2,8 The Australian Longitudinal Study on Womenâ\x80\x99s Health found
    that over 85% of young women aged 18â\x80\x9323 years aspired to be married, have
    one child and be in paid employment by the age of 35 years.9 This finding confirms
    earlier work10 which found that only 6â\x80\x938% of Australian women aspire to
    childlessness. There is, however, a significant gap between the number of children
    women tell researchers they want, and the number they achieve. This gap between
    fertility aspirations and fertility attainment has led to predictions that in
    Australia, up to a quarter of women will end their fertile years childless.11
    Such realities suggest that â\x80\x98choiceâ\x80\x99 and infertility may not be
    the only factors affecting womenâ\x80\x99s reproductive outcomes. Importantly,
    the sustained low fertility rates in industrialised countries may be partly explained
    by circumstances that constrain womenâ\x80\x99s freedom to mother at all, or to
    have as many children as they plan and desire.2</p>\n\n<p>The factors behind contemporary
    womenâ\x80\x99s childbearing behaviour are multifactorial and complex.12 Contributing
    factors include effective contraception, liberalised abortion laws, womenâ\x80\x99s
    increased involvement and commitment to the workforce and a desire to achieve
    both financial security and a suitable partner before parenting. The result is
    that increasing numbers of women in Western countries are delaying their first
    pregnancy until around age 30 years.7,13 In 1998, just under a third of Australian
    women aged 30 years or over had their first birth; 2011 data from the Australian
    Institute of Health and Welfare14 indicates this proportion has increased to over
    54%, with 23% of all firstchild births occurring in women aged 35 years and over.</p>\n\n<p>Fact
    2: There can be medical consequences to delaying childbearing\nFemale fertility
    declines with increasing age. Age related fertility problems increase after 35
    years and significantly after 40 years.3 Pregnancies in older women are more likely
    to result in adverse outcomes such as stillbirth, miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy15
    as well as multiple births and congenital malformations.16 Pregnancies in women
    aged over 40 years are also associated with more nonsevere complications, premature
    births and interventions at birth.17 Women over the age of 35 years have an increased
    risk of specific fetal abnormalities, including structural18 and chromosomal19
    abnormalities. While some tests are noninvasive, others require invasive techniques
    that are associated with an additional miscarriage risk.20</p>\n\n<p>Increasing
    numbers of women are using assisted reproductive technology (ART) to improve their
    conception outcomes. The average age of Australian women using ART to achieve
    a pregnancy has risen from 31 years in 1993 to just under 34 years in 2009, and
    one in 4 women have used ART by 40 years of age.21 However, some younger women
    may not realise that ART cannot entirely or reliably compensate for the decline
    in fecundity associated with age and delayed attempts at conceiving.17 For women
    over 30 years of age using ART, each additional year in age was associated with
    an 11% reduction in the likelihood of achieving pregnancy and a 13% reduction
    in the chance of a live delivery.22 In addition, the stress related to fertility
    treatment may discourage, and ultimately deter, women and their partners from
    further attempts at conception.23</p>\n\n<p>Fact 3: Some womenâ\x80\x99s ideas
    about their fertility donâ\x80\x99t match the â\x80\x98scientific factsâ\x80\x99\nResearch
    has shown that women are ill informed about the relationship between age and infertility.
    An Australian study of women aged over 35 years seeking ART found that 18% were
    unaware of the impact of age on fertility.7 Similarly, in the USA, 88% of women
    overestimated by 5â\x80\x9310 years the age at which fertility begins to decline24
    while in Sweden, researchers found that university students planned to have children
    at ages when female fertility is decreased without being sufficiently aware of
    the age related decline in fertility.25</p>\n\n<p>In addition, women may be misinformed
    about the ability of ART to overcome the â\x80\x98biological clockâ\x80\x99 and
    its efficacy more generally and may overestimate their chance of having a baby
    by using these techniques.26,27 Weston and colleagues10 found that 60% of men
    and women believed that they or their partners were likely, or very likely, to
    conceive if they used in vitro fertilisation (IVF) with only 8% saying success
    was unlikely. They also found that despite the declining live birth rate from
    IVF with increasing age, those aged in their late 30s were just as likely as those
    in their 20s or early 30s to be optimistic about their ability to have a child
    using IVF techniques.10 This suggests that people of childbearing age may be unaware
    of the importance of the female and male partnerâ\x80\x99s age in determining
    the chance of having an IVF baby and may see it as a fallback option.28</p>\n\n<p>Women
    may also have limited knowledge of the association between fetal abnormality and
    increasing maternal age,29 as well as the role of prenatal testing for the fetal
    abnormalities associated with maternal age.29 One study found that while nearly
    all women had heard of Down syndrome, less than half were aware that the condition
    involved intellectual disability.30</p>\n\n<p>Patient autonomy, informed decision
    making and reproductive rights\nPatient autonomy, or â\x80\x98self ruleâ\x80\x99,
    is a key, if not an overriding consideration in contemporary medical practice
    and medical law.31,32 An autonomous patient is one who is able to make voluntary
    and informed decisions about their healthcare.32,33 Fostering patient autonomy
    is a key objective of ethical medical care, a responsibility that includes an
    obligation on the part of medical practitioners to ensure that their patients
    obtain an understanding of all relevant information so that they may participate
    in, and make informed choices about, their healthcare. Where fertility is concerned,
    the principle of autonomy dictates that women have a right to know and understand
    their fertile body.34 This requires medical professionals to assist their patients
    to develop an adequately sophisticated understanding of their fertility and its
    limits so that they can make reproductive health decisions consistent with their
    short and long term fertility life plans. The World Health Organization identifies
    sexual and reproductive health as a human right and a priority that should be
    promoted through woman centred care in comprehensive primary care settings.35</p>\n\n<p>With
    this in mind, some have advocated intervention by GPs calling for â\x80\x98positive
    family planningâ\x80\x99.36 Bachrach36 argues that when a childless woman comes
    for a health check-up or for contraceptive advice or prescription, GPs should
    use the opportunity to refresh the womanâ\x80\x99s understanding of her reproductive
    lifespan, discuss her plans regarding childbearing and make contraceptive and
    other recommendations commensurate with those plans. However, others argue that
    positive family planning approaches are inconsistent with a GPâ\x80\x99s ethical
    obligation to promote patient autonomy, and that where reproductive information
    giving is perceived as encouragement by GPs for female patients to get pregnant
    at a younger age, it would be paternalistic and â\x80\x98politically incorrectâ\x80\x99.24</p>\n\n<p>Some
    research suggests that GPs may be unwilling to participate in these types of discussions
    with patients.37 However, little is known about whether GPs are undertaking such
    interventions, their capacity to do this work, the obstacles to effective and
    ethical communication on such sensitive issues and whether such efforts would
    be welcomed by, and prove informative to, patients. More research into this important
    area is needed (Table 2).</p>\n\n<p>Table 2. Areas for further research by population
    group\nWomen\nPerceptions and beliefs about fertility\nPerceptions regarding the
    opportunities and limitations of achieving desired number of children\nEmotional
    and pragmatic responses to final fertility outcomes\nGeneral practitioners\nThe
    effects of implementing positive family planning in general practice\nBarriers
    and enablers to implementing positive family planning in general practice\nPerceptions
    by patients of GPs delivering positive family planning\nSummary\nMedical professionals
    and society in general should support women to achieve their individual reproductive
    goals, whether those goals include a desire for many children or none at all.
    While there are many socioeconomic factors that influence womenâ\x80\x99s reproductive
    decision making, lack of appropriate knowledge about age related decline in fertility
    and the inability of reproductive technologies to overcome diminished fecundity
    in later life may be contributory factors. By informing women of the gap between
    fertility desires and reproductive outcomes, the medical consequences of delayed
    childbearing, and the discrepancy between lay knowledge and current scientific
    knowledge of age related fertility issues, primary care providers are promoting
    informed decision making as a means of fostering patient autonomy. However, GPs
    and other primary care providers may perceive imparting this information as paternalistic
    or overstepping professional boundaries.</p>\n\n<p>Limited research has been undertaken
    in this area and there is need to investigate how best to provide this information
    to women (ie. via individual or public health-type approaches). Research should
    also be directed at understanding how GPs and primary care providers perceive
    discussions with female patients around childbearing and fertility intentions
    and how decisions to delay childbearing affect family structure and womenâ\x80\x99s
    physical and mental health. Only then can evidence based supports be implemented
    to better enable women to achieve their fertility goals. Irrespective of the particular
    reproductive outcome for any given woman, medicine has an important role to play
    in ensuring womenâ\x80\x99s fertility outcomes are a matter of choice, not chance.</p>\n\n<p>Conflict

title: Making Decision About Fertility in Australian Family Physician
--- "**Background**\r\n\r\nAverage annual fertility rates in industrialised countries
  have been below two children per woman for the past 3 decades. The reasons behind
  womenâ\x80\x99s childbearing behaviour are complex. However, a lack of awareness
  regarding the consequences of delayed childbearing and the inability of reproductive
  technologies to overcome the â\x80\x98biological clockâ\x80\x99 may be contributory
  factors.\r\n\r\n**Objective**\r\nA narrative review guided by the research question:
  What do women need to know about the consequences of delayed childbearing in order
  to make informed decisions about their fertility?\r\n\r\n**Discussion**\r\nThere
  are three facts that women need to know in order to make informed decisions around
  their fertility: Some women want to have more children than they are able to have
  because they postpone childbearing; there can be medical consequences to delaying
  childbearing and; some womenâ\x80\x99s ideas about their fertility donâ\x80\x99t
  match the â\x80\x98the scientific factsâ\x80\x99. General practitioners are well
  placed to play a strategic role in the provision of timely, relevant information
  to help women make informed decisions about their fertility. Further research is
  needed to identify the most appropriate ways for GPs to communicate this information.\r\n\r\nAverage
  annual fertility rates in almost all industrialised countries have been below two
  children per woman for the past 3 decades.1 Such sustained low fertility can be
  associated with complex social, economic and population management issues as the
  population ages. More importantly, the rates may be less an expression of â\x80\x98what
  women want when it comes to motherhood and more of a reflection of what women are
  gettingâ\x80\x99.2\r\n\r\nLow fertility rates can result from women progressively
  postponing the first time they give birth. Such postponement may be due to aspirations
  for education, career and financial security; the challenges women face in finding
  and securing care arrangements (whether in heterosexual, gay/lesbian or single parent
  families); and the effect of experiences of first pregnancy, physical infertility,
  and poor pregnancy outcomes on future fertility. In practical terms, postponement
  increases the age of first motherhood, reducing the remaining time in which women
  can have a child and increasing their likelihood of ending up childless, or with
  fewer children than they wanted and planned to have. The recent trend in delayed
  childbearing, and consequent overall reduced fertility, has led to what is often
  called an â\x80\x98epidemic of pregnancy in middle ageâ\x80\x99.3 This has been
  observed among women in many parts of the developed world, including the United
  States,4 Canada,5 Europe6 and Australia.7 Of significant concern is that women may
  be delaying their first pregnancy without knowing or understanding the consequences
  of this decision on their future fertility.\r\n\r\nThis article, focusing on the
  Australian setting, argues that there are three critical facts that women need to
  know in order to make informed decisions around their fertility.\r\n\r\nSome women
  want to have more children than they are able to have because they postpone childbearing\r\nThere
  can be medical consequences to delaying childbearing\r\nSome womenâ\x80\x99s ideas
  about their fertility donâ\x80\x99t match the â\x80\x98scientific factsâ\x80\x99.\r\nIn
  presenting these facts, we highlight gaps in the research that require further investigation.
  Currently, much of the evidence about the â\x80\x98chosenâ\x80\x99 nature of womenâ\x80\x99s
  fertility comes from population based studies. Little is known about how women conceptualise
  their fertility journey, what they understand about the opportunities and limits
  of their fertility, and how they react emotionally and practically to final fertility
  outcomes that differ from the maternity desires and intentions they had at the start
  of their childbearing years.\r\n\r\nGeneral practitioners are well placed to play
  a strategic role in the provision of this information (Table 1). Incontrovertibly,
  womenâ\x80\x99s decision to delay childbearing is often influenced by wider sociopolitical
  contexts and debates around patient autonomy and reproductive rights. It is important
  that GPs acknowledge these contexts when aiming to communicate the facts to women
  patients. Some GPs may feel that this role is not within their ambit. However, we
  argue that it is necessary for women to have all the available information in order
  to make informed decisions about their fertility and that GPs are in an ideal position
  to provide this information.\r\n\r\nTable 1. The strategic role of GPs in providing
  fertility information\r\nEach year, Australian GPs consult with 86% of the population38
  and 3.6 of every 100 consultations between GPs and patients involves contraception
  management39\r\n\r\nGPs are often the first point-of-contact for an infertile couple
  and play an important role in referral, ordering further tests, and ensuring individuals
  receive appropriate and timely fertility care40\r\n\r\nBuilding on their existing
  relationship with patients, GPs have an opportunity during a wide range of consultations
  (eg. during routine Pap tests, health check-ups, and contraceptive consultations)
  to gain an understanding of their patientsâ\x80\x99 short and long term reproductive
  goals\r\n\r\nBy engaging in positive family planning and taking a patient centred
  approach, GPs can offer relevant â\x80\x98fertility factsâ\x80\x9941 to patients
  as part of their responsibility to assist the patient to make informed decisions\r\n\r\nFurther
  research is needed to identify the most appropriate way for GPs to deliver these
  fertility facts without sounding condescending or patronising\r\n\r\nFact 1: Some
  women want to have more children than they are able to have because they postpone
  childbearing\r\nLow fertility rates are a consequence of some women having no children
  and others having fewer children. Research suggests that many women have clear aspirations
  by their late teens or early 20s with regard to future parenthood.2,8 The Australian
  Longitudinal Study on Womenâ\x80\x99s Health found that over 85% of young women
  aged 18â\x80\x9323 years aspired to be married, have one child and be in paid employment
  by the age of 35 years.9 This finding confirms earlier work10 which found that only
  6â\x80\x938% of Australian women aspire to childlessness. There is, however, a significant
  gap between the number of children women tell researchers they want, and the number
  they achieve. This gap between fertility aspirations and fertility attainment has
  led to predictions that in Australia, up to a quarter of women will end their fertile
  years childless.11 Such realities suggest that â\x80\x98choiceâ\x80\x99 and infertility
  may not be the only factors affecting womenâ\x80\x99s reproductive outcomes. Importantly,
  the sustained low fertility rates in industrialised countries may be partly explained
  by circumstances that constrain womenâ\x80\x99s freedom to mother at all, or to
  have as many children as they plan and desire.2\r\n\r\nThe factors behind contemporary
  womenâ\x80\x99s childbearing behaviour are multifactorial and complex.12 Contributing
  factors include effective contraception, liberalised abortion laws, womenâ\x80\x99s
  increased involvement and commitment to the workforce and a desire to achieve both
  financial security and a suitable partner before parenting. The result is that increasing
  numbers of women in Western countries are delaying their first pregnancy until around
  age 30 years.7,13 In 1998, just under a third of Australian women aged 30 years
  or over had their first birth; 2011 data from the Australian Institute of Health
  and Welfare14 indicates this proportion has increased to over 54%, with 23% of all
  firstchild births occurring in women aged 35 years and over.\r\n\r\nFact 2: There
  can be medical consequences to delaying childbearing\r\nFemale fertility declines
  with increasing age. Age related fertility problems increase after 35 years and
  significantly after 40 years.3 Pregnancies in older women are more likely to result
  in adverse outcomes such as stillbirth, miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy15 as well
  as multiple births and congenital malformations.16 Pregnancies in women aged over
  40 years are also associated with more nonsevere complications, premature births
  and interventions at birth.17 Women over the age of 35 years have an increased risk
  of specific fetal abnormalities, including structural18 and chromosomal19 abnormalities.
  While some tests are noninvasive, others require invasive techniques that are associated
  with an additional miscarriage risk.20\r\n\r\nIncreasing numbers of women are using
  assisted reproductive technology (ART) to improve their conception outcomes. The
  average age of Australian women using ART to achieve a pregnancy has risen from
  31 years in 1993 to just under 34 years in 2009, and one in 4 women have used ART
  by 40 years of age.21 However, some younger women may not realise that ART cannot
  entirely or reliably compensate for the decline in fecundity associated with age
  and delayed attempts at conceiving.17 For women over 30 years of age using ART,
  each additional year in age was associated with an 11% reduction in the likelihood
  of achieving pregnancy and a 13% reduction in the chance of a live delivery.22 In
  addition, the stress related to fertility treatment may discourage, and ultimately
  deter, women and their partners from further attempts at conception.23\r\n\r\nFact
  3: Some womenâ\x80\x99s ideas about their fertility donâ\x80\x99t match the â\x80\x98scientific
  factsâ\x80\x99\r\nResearch has shown that women are ill informed about the relationship
  between age and infertility. An Australian study of women aged over 35 years seeking
  ART found that 18% were unaware of the impact of age on fertility.7 Similarly, in
  the USA, 88% of women overestimated by 5â\x80\x9310 years the age at which fertility
  begins to decline24 while in Sweden, researchers found that university students
  planned to have children at ages when female fertility is decreased without being
  sufficiently aware of the age related decline in fertility.25\r\n\r\nIn addition,
  women may be misinformed about the ability of ART to overcome the â\x80\x98biological
  clockâ\x80\x99 and its efficacy more generally and may overestimate their chance
  of having a baby by using these techniques.26,27 Weston and colleagues10 found that
  60% of men and women believed that they or their partners were likely, or very likely,
  to conceive if they used in vitro fertilisation (IVF) with only 8% saying success
  was unlikely. They also found that despite the declining live birth rate from IVF
  with increasing age, those aged in their late 30s were just as likely as those in
  their 20s or early 30s to be optimistic about their ability to have a child using
  IVF techniques.10 This suggests that people of childbearing age may be unaware of
  the importance of the female and male partnerâ\x80\x99s age in determining the chance
  of having an IVF baby and may see it as a fallback option.28\r\n\r\nWomen may also
  have limited knowledge of the association between fetal abnormality and increasing
  maternal age,29 as well as the role of prenatal testing for the fetal abnormalities
  associated with maternal age.29 One study found that while nearly all women had
  heard of Down syndrome, less than half were aware that the condition involved intellectual
  disability.30\r\n\r\nPatient autonomy, informed decision making and reproductive
  rights\r\nPatient autonomy, or â\x80\x98self ruleâ\x80\x99, is a key, if not an
  overriding consideration in contemporary medical practice and medical law.31,32
  An autonomous patient is one who is able to make voluntary and informed decisions
  about their healthcare.32,33 Fostering patient autonomy is a key objective of ethical
  medical care, a responsibility that includes an obligation on the part of medical
  practitioners to ensure that their patients obtain an understanding of all relevant
  information so that they may participate in, and make informed choices about, their
  healthcare. Where fertility is concerned, the principle of autonomy dictates that
  women have a right to know and understand their fertile body.34 This requires medical
  professionals to assist their patients to develop an adequately sophisticated understanding
  of their fertility and its limits so that they can make reproductive health decisions
  consistent with their short and long term fertility life plans. The World Health
  Organization identifies sexual and reproductive health as a human right and a priority
  that should be promoted through woman centred care in comprehensive primary care
  settings.35\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, some have advocated intervention by GPs calling
  for â\x80\x98positive family planningâ\x80\x99.36 Bachrach36 argues that when a
  childless woman comes for a health check-up or for contraceptive advice or prescription,
  GPs should use the opportunity to refresh the womanâ\x80\x99s understanding of her
  reproductive lifespan, discuss her plans regarding childbearing and make contraceptive
  and other recommendations commensurate with those plans. However, others argue that
  positive family planning approaches are inconsistent with a GPâ\x80\x99s ethical
  obligation to promote patient autonomy, and that where reproductive information
  giving is perceived as encouragement by GPs for female patients to get pregnant
  at a younger age, it would be paternalistic and â\x80\x98politically incorrectâ\x80\x99.24\r\n\r\nSome
  research suggests that GPs may be unwilling to participate in these types of discussions
  with patients.37 However, little is known about whether GPs are undertaking such
  interventions, their capacity to do this work, the obstacles to effective and ethical
  communication on such sensitive issues and whether such efforts would be welcomed
  by, and prove informative to, patients. More research into this important area is
  needed (Table 2).\r\n\r\nTable 2. Areas for further research by population group\r\nWomen\r\nPerceptions
  and beliefs about fertility\r\nPerceptions regarding the opportunities and limitations
  of achieving desired number of children\r\nEmotional and pragmatic responses to

  positive family planning in general practice\r\nBarriers and enablers to implementing
  positive family planning in general practice\r\nPerceptions by patients of GPs delivering
  positive family planning\r\nSummary\r\nMedical professionals and society in general
  should support women to achieve their individual reproductive goals, whether those
  goals include a desire for many children or none at all. While there are many socioeconomic
  factors that influence womenâ\x80\x99s reproductive decision making, lack of appropriate
  knowledge about age related decline in fertility and the inability of reproductive
  technologies to overcome diminished fecundity in later life may be contributory
  factors. By informing women of the gap between fertility desires and reproductive
  outcomes, the medical consequences of delayed childbearing, and the discrepancy
  between lay knowledge and current scientific knowledge of age related fertility
  issues, primary care providers are promoting informed decision making as a means
  of fostering patient autonomy. However, GPs and other primary care providers may
  perceive imparting this information as paternalistic or overstepping professional
  boundaries.\r\n\r\nLimited research has been undertaken in this area and there is
  need to investigate how best to provide this information to women (ie. via individual
  or public health-type approaches). Research should also be directed at understanding
  how GPs and primary care providers perceive discussions with female patients around
  childbearing and fertility intentions and how decisions to delay childbearing affect
  family structure and womenâ\x80\x99s physical and mental health. Only then can evidence
  based supports be implemented to better enable women to achieve their fertility
  goals. Irrespective of the particular reproductive outcome for any given woman,
  medicine has an important role to play in ensuring womenâ\x80\x99s fertility outcomes
  are a matter of choice, not chance.\r\n\r\nConflict of interest: none declared.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nSleebos
