    Betty Friedan. Once named, the problem had a chance of having its\r\nparameters
    defined and negative consequences addressed.\r\n\r\nNow, we are in the grip of
    another problem with no name. Yet the\r\nevidence is everywhere that worthy individuals
    are strangling in its\r\ngrip and that in democratic societies the quality of
    public debate and\r\npolitical decision-making is staggering under its weight.\r\n\r\nThe
    problem is a growing and collective regression in the way we decide\r\nwhat is
    right and true, and, on the basis of this knowledge, how to act.\r\n\r\nHow did
    we decide in the past? Back in the day, people knew what was\r\ntrue because they
    felt it in their bones or because their customs and\r\ntraditions spelt it out.
    Or they knew because powerful men in their\r\ncommunity who claimed to represent
    their chosen god, or gods, told them\r\nor the local tribesmen commanded they
    understand it on pain of death.\r\n\r\nArguably, the march of Western nations
    through the enlightenment and\r\ninto the prosperity and social stability we enjoy
    today, has been the\r\nresult of new ways of knowing. Since the 18th century,
    decision-making\r\nthat involves persuasion by dispassionate rational argument
    and evidence\r\nhas been the rage.\r\n\r\nBut now, it seems, the titans of ignorance
    are struggling to reassert\r\ncommand. To watch them in action, tune in to *Fox
    News* or shock-jock\r\nradio or the comments section of any opinion website. What
    youâ\x80\x99ll find\r\nthere is more than evidence of the Dunning-Kruger effect
    or what\r\nBertrand Russell referred to as the certainty of the stupid. Youâ\x80\x99ll
    also\r\nwitness what John Birmingham calls the toxic, self-defeating culture of\r\nrednecks
    and the â\x80\x9Ccalculating corporate succubus [that] both feeds on\r\nit, and
    exploits it for cheap labor and ready cannon fodderâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nPart and
    parcel of this malignant culture is the deployment of threat,\r\ndeception or
    slight of hand to silence dissent, or to manufacture\r\nconsent. Here the greatest
    ridicule is reserved for those who dare to\r\nimply that their views are guided
    by reason, evidence and concern for\r\nthe public good, rather than circular logic
    designed to pander to\r\nself-serving interests. Because, hey, itâ\x80\x99s all
    just opinion anyway and\r\neveryoneâ\x80\x99s got one of those, so why give one
    personâ\x80\x99s more weight?\r\n\r\nThis is the true clash of civilisations.
    Or, to be more precise, the\r\ninternecine collision of different ways of running
    a society that\r\ndetermines whether you get a civilisation or a nasty, brutish
    Hobbesian\r\nwasteland.\r\n\r\nIn one corner are the critical thinkers whoâ\x80\x99ve
    spent years trying to\r\nwrap their heads around complex information and evidence
    so they can\r\noffer an informed view on public policy. They deploy reason and
    evidence\r\nin a good faith attempt to persuade their fellow citizens to choose
    one\r\ncourse over another.\r\n\r\nIn the other are those who seek to get their
    way to serve the best\r\ninterests of themselves, their family and their mates.
    They deploy the\r\ntime-honoured tricks of the influence trade - charisma, threat,
    trickery\r\nand pork barrelling - while depicting the world as forever and\r\nintractably
    dog-eat-dog and anyone who doesnâ\x80\x99t know it as a chump.\r\n\r\nWho will
    win the battle? Itâ\x80\x99s too early to say. But I fear for the\r\nexperts -
    hampered by values of fair play that prohibit logical\r\nfallacies, question-begging
    and playing the person instead of the ball -\r\neven if it helps them win the
    day.\r\n\r\nBloody sanctimonious elites."
