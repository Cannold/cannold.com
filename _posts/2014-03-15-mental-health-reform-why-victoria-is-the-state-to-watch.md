    to six years later and the Mental Health Bill 2014 has just been introduced into
    Victoria's lower house. The bill represents Victoria's bid for leadership status
    in the implementation of consultative mental health reform. Such reform puts mental
    health consumers (an alternative term for \"patients\") and families at the centre
    of the care and funding frame.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the Victorian approach such a
    human rights standout?\r\n\r\nThe new legislation places considerable limits on
    restraint and seclusion. In her second reading speech the Minister for Mental
    Health, Mary Wooldridge, noted the highly intrusive nature of practices that,
    \"tragically have been linked to injuries and deaths\".\r\n\r\nTo reduce, and,
    where possible, eliminate the use of restrictive interventions, the Bill says
    they may only be used where necessary to prevent \"imminent and serious harm\",
    and only after \"all reasonable and less restrictive options have been tried or
    considered and have been found unsuitable\".\r\n\r\nA range of parties must be
    notified where restrictive practices are deployed, including the consumer's nominated
    person and the chief psychiatrist. Reviews of medical decisions to restrain or
    seclude must occur no less than every 15 minutes and cease once the legal justification
    is absent.\r\n\r\nCentral to the emancipatory flavour of the legislation is a
    presumption of capacity - or what is sometimes referred to as \"competence\".
    The new legislation assumes that all consumers have capacity and - relatedly -
    the right to refuse or consent to assessment and treatment.\r\n\r\nPractitioners
    who wish to override a consumer's decision must be satisfied that the person is
    ill and an immediate intervention is required to prevent serious deterioration
    or harm to themselves or others. Even when these conditions are satisfied, genuine
    consultation with the person and their wider support network must occur.\r\n\r\nIf
    the consumer is not assessed within 24 hours (a maximum of two 24-hour extensions
    can be sought) the order lapses and they are free to go.\r\nSimilarly, involuntary
    treatment must meet the serious deterioration or harm threshold. It must be authorised
    by the independent Mental Health Tribunal within 28 days - the shortest statutory
    period in the country - or the order lapses.\r\n\r\nTaken together, the aim of
    such measures is - in lay terms â\x80\x93 to reverse the burden of proof. The
    onus is on the mental health service to demonstrate the consumer lacks the capacity
    to make binding decisions about treatment. If services fail to offer adequate
    justification for treating the consumer against his or her wishes, the tribunal
    can't make a treatment order. This should encourage services to ensure the tribunal
    has the information it needs to make a timely decision in full view of the facts.\r\n\r\nWhere
    a consumer is deemed to temporarily lack capacity, the Act proposes \"supportive
    decision-making\" measures to bridge the gap between independent medical decision-making
    and complete loss of consumer control.\r\n\r\nAdvance statements and nominated
    persons support the autonomy of the consumer. \r\nAdvance statements are written
    expressions of the consumer's treatment wishes and recovery goals. They must be
    considered by the treating psychiatrist and the tribunal when a person is subject
    to compulsory treatment.\r\n\r\nThe views of the advocate selected by consumers
    to support, represent and advocate for them when they temporarily lack capacity
    must also be taken into account.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal is just one of a range of
    safeguards and oversight mechanisms in the new Mental Health Act. These include
    the Mental Health Complaints Commissioner, an accessible specialist who will receive,
    manage and resolve complaints about public sector mental health services.\r\n\r\nAdvocacy
    services will be expanded and funding provided for consumers to exercise their
    rights to an independent second psychiatric opinion on whether the criteria for
    compulsory treatment apply. While the treating practitioner is not required to
    heed a dissenting second opinion, they must explain that choice to the consumer
    and advise that a further review can be sought from the chief psychiatrist.\r\n\r\nThe
    bill has widespread support from consumers and advocates. The view of one 25-year
    veteran of the mental health system is typical: \"If it goes through, [Victoria]
    will have the most human rights-focused Mental Health Act in the country. While
    there are a couple of things I don't agree with .. the Government knew what I
    wouldn't agree with, which tells me they were listening.\"\r\n\r\nFor those who
    wish to emulate Victoria's success, the importance of a bipartisan approach, leadership
    and consultation can't be overstated. Six years in the making, it's important
    to remember the process of reforming the Mental Health Act began during the life
    of the previous Labor government and the hope is that Labor will support it.\r\n\r\nBy
    leadership and consultation, I don't mean a process by which governments detail
    their agenda and ask citizens to comment. Instead, I'm referring to the collaborative
    process described in the International Association of Public Participation's \"public
    participation spectrum\". This is one where government's \"partner with the public
    in each aspect of the decision, including the development of alternatives and
    the identification of a preferred solution.\"\r\n\r\nCertainly this is what Victorian
    Mental Illness Awareness Council director Isabell Collins was describing when
    she lauded the minister as, \"the first Mental Health Minister I've ever worked
    with who is completely committed to listening to consumers.\"\r\n\r\nï¿¼Collins
    argued that this meant, \"for the first time in 25 years consumers had a chance
    to set the reform agenda.\"\r\n\r\nThis collaborative approach seems to continue
    with what the government calls \"consumer and carer partnerships\" that see both
    carer and consumer groups enjoying regular meetings with the minister throughout
    the implementation period for the reforms.\r\n\r\nVictorians can feel justifiably
    proud of both the process and the outcome of the mental health reform process.
