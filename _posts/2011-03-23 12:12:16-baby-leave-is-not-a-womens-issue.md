    of a Coalition government.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CThe difference between our scheme and

    Abbott said. â\x80\x9CI am determined to give women a\r\nbetter chance in the
    workforce, not to make it more difficult for them.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThe announcement
    of the scheme, on International Womenâ\x80\x99s Day, left\r\nLaborâ\x80\x99s delayed
    and paltry paid parental plan for dead, and the\r\ngovernment casting about for
    lines. Witness Minister for the Status of\r\nWomen Tanya Plibersek joining with
    the Business Council of Australia and\r\nthe Australian Chamber of Commerce to
    lament the injustice of this\r\nâ\x80\x9Cmassive new tax on Australian businessesâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nExperts
    and industry groups were also dismayed. Australian Industry\r\nGroup chief executive
    Heather Ridout and Sex Discrimination Commissioner\r\nElizabeth Broderick fretted
    that an extended leave scheme such as\r\nAbbottâ\x80\x99s might discourage the
    employment of women.\r\n\r\nWhat is wrong with this picture? The same thing that
    has been wrong\r\nsince the battle for paid leave began more than 40 years ago.
    We say\r\npaid parental leave, but we mean paid maternity leave. From the language\r\nto
    the symbolism to the fraught politics and poor policy that\r\ncharacterise this
    debate, work/life policy is crippled by the absence of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nWhile Abbottâ\x80\x99s
    proposal is more generous than the governmentâ\x80\x99s safety\r\nnet plan of
    18 weeks at minimum pay, both schemes are fatally flawed.\r\nDiscussed, designed
    and sold in the language of â\x80\x9Cmumsâ\x80\x9D, they flagrantly\r\ndisregard
    the role men should - and many want to - play in the lives of\r\ntheir children.
    By failing to talk about childcare and paid leave as\r\nsomething of critical
    importance to children, men and women, both\r\npolitical parties doom us to more
    of the same work/life crunch. More\r\noppressed women, more dissatisfied men,
    more children with exhausted\r\nmums and absent dads.\r\n\r\nDid you know that
    Australian men - 68 per cent in one poll - want more\r\ninvolvement in their childrenâ\x80\x99s
    lives, but are impeded by work demands?\r\nDid you know that children whose fathers
    contribute meaningfully to\r\ntheir care have improved social skills, higher self-esteem
    and better\r\nresults at school?\r\n\r\nDo you know that children tell researchers
    they want to spend more time\r\nwith their fathers, and no amount of additional
    mother-time quells that\r\nache? Did you know that women doing most of the second-shift
    of\r\nchildcare and housework report feeling guilty and exhausted? Those who\r\nwork
    part-time or stay at home reduce their lifetime earnings by at\r\nleast $160,000
    per child, end up on the â\x80\x9Cmummy trackâ\x80\x9D when they return\r\nto
    work and wind up with 50 per cent less superannuation than men on\r\nsimilar wages.\r\n\r\nThe
    most obvious solution to this problem continues to be overlooked -\r\nnamely,
    that fathers and mothers share fairly the joys and burdens of\r\npaid employment
    and caring for their children - speaks volumes about the\r\ncapacity of vested
    interests and entrenched social attitudes to stifle\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nThat this
    is the case seems particularly clear given the ease with which\r\na gender-equity
    paradigm could be given effect in policy. All we need to\r\ndo is this: we need
    to say â\x80\x9Cparental leaveâ\x80\x9D and mean it. We need to\r\nfollow the
    lead of comparable OECD countries by allocating paid parental\r\nleave entitlements
    to families in a way that allows them to share it,\r\nand with a use-it-or-lose-it
    component for dads.\r\n\r\nMale leave must be actively encouraged in the short
    term because of our\r\nstubborn insistence on defining childcare and paid leave
    as â\x80\x9Cwomanâ\x80\x99s\r\nissuesâ\x80\x9D. This has meant that despite many
    men wanting to care for their\r\ninfants (50 per cent in one British study), they
    fear being ridiculed\r\nand punished as â\x80\x9Cunseriousâ\x80\x9D if they do.\r\n\r\nUse-it-or-lose-it
    provisions allow men to care for their children\r\nwithout suffering workplace
    repercussions, while leaving those who donâ\x80\x99t\r\nfree to knock back their
    entitlement.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the 21st century, the shift to a gender equity
    paradigm\r\n- and to serious, costed policy to match - is long overdue.\r\n\r\nIt
    is time for a paid leave policy that includes fathers as equal\r\nparticipants,
    and promotes the best interests of children. It is time to\r\nput an end to all
    the waste, not just of female talent, but of the work\r\nof past generations of
    feminists who raised their sons to share the\r\nearning and the caring with their
    partners - until backward-looking\r\npolicy and rhetoric made them think again.\r\n\r\nRepeat
    after me: the key to female liberation is men."
