    in\r\nthe right of women to be treated as rational citizens deserving of the\r\nsame
    rights and opportunities as men campaign against the science on the\r\ngrounds
    that women lack the capacity to give informed consent to egg\r\ndonation?\r\n\r\nThe
    answer to both questions is â\x80\x9Cnoâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nYet these are precisely
    the claims made by Katrina George, the director\r\nof Womenâ\x80\x99s Forum Australia
    (WFA), in her piece last Thursday 2/11/06.\r\n\r\nGeorge argued that because advances
    in stem cell research require\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99s eggs, women would be pressured
    to act against their own\r\nself-interest and to donate them. Because egg donation
    is risky, and\r\nbecause women are - quite literally - incapable of saying â\x80\x9Cnoâ\x80\x9D
    ,, the\r\nonly solution to the potential for exploitation is to ban the technology\r\nall
    together.\r\n\r\nNone of these claims withstand scrutiny.\r\n\r\nThe aim of embryonic
    stem cell research is to gain knowledge about\r\npluripotent cells, those capable
    of becoming any tissue in the body.\r\nScientists are hopeful that such cells
    will help us develop treatments\r\nfor currently incurable conditions like motor
    neuron disease,\r\nAlzheimerâ\x80\x99s and the sorts of spinal cord injuries suffered
    by the late\r\nactor Christopher Reeves. Pluripotent cells may one day allow us
    to\r\nproduce blood, and grow organs like hearts and livers that - because\r\nthey
    are genetically matched to the patient - will eliminate the need\r\nfor anti-rejection
    drugs.\r\n\r\nThe crux of Georgeâ\x80\x99s claim is that this research cannot
    be done without\r\neggs, and this means that women will be coerced into donating
    them. The\r\nsolution she proposes is to ban the technologies in Australia, despite\r\nher
    knowledge that stem cell research will continue in places like the\r\nUK, Canada,
    New Zealand, Sweden, Finland and Spain.\r\n\r\nHow will such coercion happen?
    In a submission opposing the passage of\r\nlegislation designed to allow Australian
    scientists greater freedom to\r\npursue stem cell cures, WFA said that if eggs
    are allowed to be sold,\r\npoor women will have no choice but to donate against
    their will.\r\n\r\nA valid claim, except for the fact that the legislation - to
    be debated\r\nin the Senate next week - explicitly prohibits the sale of eggs,
    sperms\r\nor embryos. Those guilty of inducing egg donation by offers of cash,
    a\r\ndiscount on treatment or even giving priority in the provision of\r\nservice
    risk up to 10 years in jail.\r\n\r\nWomenâ\x80\x99s Forum Australia also claims
    that women will be coerced into\r\ndonating by their desire to be seen as â\x80\x9Cgood
    womenâ\x80\x9D. Their submission\r\nsays that â\x80\x9Csocial and cultural expectations
    of feminine self-sacriificeâ\x80\x9D\r\nwill lead women to â\x80\x9Csacrifice
    their own interests, and assume the health\r\nrisks of ova extraction for the
    sake of othersâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nIn fact, women already donate eggs. In 2003 196
    Victorian women gave\r\ntheir eggs to women they knew, although a small number
    donated to\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nIs Womenâ\x80\x99s Forum Australia saying these
    women didnâ\x80\x99t really choose to\r\nmake such donations, but were simply
    trying to look like â\x80\x9Cgood womenâ\x80\x9D in\r\nthe eyes of others? If
    such altruism should be banned when it comes to\r\nstem cell science, shouldnâ\x80\x99t
    women be prohibited from donating eggs to\r\nwomen facing infertility, too?\r\n\r\nWomen
    also donate blood, though this - like all medical procedures -\r\ncarries risks.
    Should the state also step in here and say â\x80\x9Cnoâ\x80\x9D?\r\n\r\nHow would
    any of us feel to be told that we cannot donate an egg to a\r\nsister suffering
    infertility or to a stem cell research project\r\nattempting to cure a disease
    from which we, or a beloved child, suffers?\r\n\r\nThe answer is infantilized,
    patronized, and mad as hell. If George\r\nthinks egg donation is too risky, she
    has the right to say â\x80\x9Cnoâ\x80\x9D. What\r\nshe doesnâ\x80\x99t deserve
    is the freedom to stop me, or any other women,\r\nmaking my own risk/benefit calculation,
    and my own choice.\r\n\r\nWhich takes us back to our first question: is stem cell
    science\r\nanti-woman? The clear answer is â\x80\x9Cno.â\x80\x9D Researchers and
    scientists believe\r\nthat as long as relevant legal rulings and ethical guidelines
    are\r\nfollowed, women have the same ability to give - or withhold - informed\r\nconsent
    to being involved as men.\r\n\r\nCuriously, the sole source of sexism in the debate
    comes from groups\r\nasserting feminist credentials. Womenâ\x80\x99s Forum Australia
    describes itself\r\nas an â\x80\x9Cindependent thinktankâ\x80\x9D that promotes
    â\x80\x9Cthe advancement, well-being\r\nand freedom of all womenâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nThe
    directors of WFA include the â\x80\x9Cbioethical advisorâ\x80\x9D to former pro-life\r\nSenator
    Brian Harradine, two women - including George - with links to\r\nOpus Dei and
    a Southern Cross Bioethics Institute (SCBI) staff member.\r\nSCBI is the research
    arm of Southern Cross Care, which is the product of\r\nthe Knights of the Southern
    Cross, an order of Catholic men â\x80\x9Ccommitted\r\nto promoting the Christian
    way of life throughout Australiaâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nDefining â\x80\x9Cindependentâ\x80\x9D
    is tricky, but there is little doubt that\r\nâ\x80\x9Cthinktanksâ\x80\x9D should
    do good thinking.\r\n\r\nThe factual sloppiness and offensively sexist nature
    of arguments\r\nadvanced by George donâ\x80\x99t fit the bill."
