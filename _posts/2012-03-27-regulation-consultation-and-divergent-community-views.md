    consultation of some sort is a frequent feature of either the process leading
    up to regulation or of the regulatory mechanism itself. Not surprisingly, widely
    divergent views on the moral and political acceptability of ART are expressed
    during such consultations. And while such diversity of opinion is to be expected,
    and some even argue welcomed, in pluralist liberal democratic societies, it is

    justified, even when there is radical moral disagreement in the community, and

    bodies undertake in making regulatory recommendations to government. Then, it
    both proposes and justifies a method for dealing with the contradictory moral
    views expressed by interested parties during the consultation process. To illustrate
