    from a Victorian ALP confident the Democratic Labor Partyâ\x80\x99s\r\nnumber
    two man had cheated its own candidate of victory, the Victorian\r\nElectoral Commission
    (VEC) ran the figures again. On Thursday, the\r\nelevation of a third Greenâ\x80\x99s
    candidate to the Upper House was announced.\r\n\r\nPaul Austin (Opinion 14/12)
    derided those who feared a second DLP berth\r\nwould unleash the same sort of
    horse-trading that Federal Family First\r\nSenator Steven Fielding has made an
    art form. But Austin is mistaken. It\r\nis true that the DLP would have been only
    one of 3 minor parties with\r\nwhom Labor could have done deals to pass contested
    legislation in the\r\nupper house. However, the known reluctance of socially conservative\r\nPremier
    Steve Bracks to allow a vote to happen on the decriminalisation\r\nof abortion,
    and the implied willingness of the DLP to unquestioningly\r\nstand as one with
    the government if it shelved plans to bring the issue\r\nto a vote, made the party
    a real threat to progress on this and other\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99s reproductive health
    issues. Indeed, it is possible that the\r\nelected DLP Member Peter Kavanagh retains
    the power to blackmail the\r\ngovernment into steering clear of the abortion debate,
    given the\r\nnecessity of his vote for the opposition parties to call the government\r\nto
    account through the inquiry and committee process.\r\n\r\nThere are two conclusions
    to be drawn from the DLP seat that might have\r\nbeen. The first is that sadly,
    state party functionaries appear\r\nincapable of learning from the glacial mistakes
    of their Federal\r\ncounterparts. Despite the election of Family Firstâ\x80\x99s
    Steven Fielding to\r\nthe Australian Senate in 2004 on preference deals (the party
    had just\r\nunder 2% of the primary vote), Victorian party apparatchiks adopted\r\nsimilarly
    misguided tactics in their preferencing of the DLP. Hopefully,\r\nit wonâ\x80\x99t
    require an entire electoral cycle of monorail-minded horse\r\ntrading of votes
    on key national issues in exchange for misogynist\r\nhealth policy and a bit of
    verbal gay-bashing, to prompt wiser choices\r\nnext time around.\r\n\r\nWhich
    brings me to the second point: the sobering fact that around 98\r\nper cent of
    Victorians in Federal elections, and 95 per cent in State\r\nones, vote above
    the line. Such electors chose only the party that gets\r\ntheir primary vote.
    That party then decide - according to prevailing\r\npriorities, beliefs, relationships,
    threats and patronage promises - how\r\ntheir vote will be redistributed in the
    event its candidate fails to get\r\nover the line.\r\n\r\nThe cynicism Australians
    feel about their political leaders makes this\r\nan odd choice. Why give those
    you neither trust nor respect critical\r\ncontrol over who wields the reigns of
    power? On the other hand,\r\nreservoirs of contempt may have nowhere to flow but
    to seas of\r\nindifference. This is certainly the view of the experts who, in
    the\r\nabsence of hard data, speculate that a strong desire for voting to be\r\nquick
    and painless motivates many to vote above the line. Above-the-line\r\nvoting is
    quick, and reduces the stress surrounding additional\r\ndecision-making beyond
    who we like best.\r\n\r\nHowever, laziness and indifference may not entirely explain
    our voting\r\nbehaviour. Despite the newness of procedures surrounding the election
    of\r\nthe upper house last month, approximately 3 per cent more Victorians\r\nvoted
    below the line than had done in the 2004 Federal election. This\r\nmay be because
    the new ballot paper makes below-the-line voting easier,\r\nrequiring voters to
    rank just five candidates rather than the\r\napproximately 65 needing to be ordered
    when voting Federally.\r\n\r\nI also canâ\x80\x99t help wondering whether voters
    equipped with better\r\ninformation about what their preferred party intends to
    do with their\r\nvote might be less inclined to hand over control. While the Victorian\r\nElectoral
    Act requires group voting tickets to be â\x80\x9Cprominently\r\ndisplayedâ\x80\x9D
    at polling booths, the VEC does little more than post\r\npreference deals on its
    website and signpost the managerâ\x80\x99s possession of\r\nthis information at
    voting centres. In the future, it might be hoped\r\nthat the Bracks governmentâ\x80\x99s
    laudatory march towards a state-of-the-art\r\nelectoral system would see electronic
    voting offered to all Victorians,\r\nnot just the vision-impaired. I fantasise
    about a computer interface\r\nthat would respond to an above-the-line vote above
    the line with an\r\ninformation screen explaining the nature of this choice, the
    preference\r\narrangements of the party selected, and a â\x80\x9Ccomplete your
    voteâ\x80\x9D and\r\nâ\x80\x9Cchange your voteâ\x80\x9D option.\r\n\r\nIt is unfair
    to attribute the Family First fiasco and DLP debacle to the\r\nsingle transferable
    vote and the proportionality it introduces into the\r\nAustralian political system.
    Proportional representation is widely\r\nacknowledged to introduce valuable elements
    of sharing, disbursing and\r\nlimiting power into a democracy that concentrates
    significant power in\r\nthe hands of the majority. Instead, it may be the refusal
    of the\r\noverwhelming majority of Australian electors to take control of the\r\nentire
    life course of their vote that results in the elevation of\r\ncandidates that
    few choose - in a meaningfully informed fashion - to\r\ngovern us."
