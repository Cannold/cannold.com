    Minister David Campbell has this to say about revelations he\r\nhad visited a
    gay bathhouse:\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x99I made some personal choices which have put me
    and my family in\r\nthis situationâ\x80¦Iâ\x80\x99ve apologised to them for it.
    I apologise to the\r\ncommunity.\"\r\n\r\nCampbellâ\x80\x99s apology was reminiscent
    of that made by golfer Tiger Woods in\r\nFebruary. When Woodâ\x80\x99s extra-marital
    affairs were exposed in the media,\r\nhe held a press conference to beg forgiveness
    not just from his wife\r\nElin, but from everyone else, too:\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CI
    was unfaithful, I had affairs and I cheatedâ\x80¦I hurt my wife, my kids,\r\nmy
    mother, my wifeâ\x80\x99s family, my friends, my foundation and kids all\r\naround
    the world who admired meâ\x80¦â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nOf course, Tiger comes from the
    land of the prostrate mea culpa. When\r\nSouth Carolina governor Mark Sanford
    held a news conference in June last\r\nyear to reveal details about his extra-marital
    affair-the details of\r\nwhich had been known to his family for months-few were
    left off the list\r\nof wounded. Sanford begged forgiveness from his wife, his
    four boys and\r\nthe state of South Carolina. â\x80\x9CI have been unfaithful
    to my wifeâ\x80¦I hurt\r\nyou all. I hurt my wife. I hurt my boys.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIt
    makes me want to hit someone. An extra-marital affair breaches the\r\nexplicit
    promise most couples make when they wed to be sexually\r\nexclusive. Spouses whoâ\x80\x99ve
    been cheated on feel, and have every right to\r\nfeel, betrayed and deceived,
    not just about the affair itself, but the\r\nlying that tends to go on to keep
    it under wraps.\r\n\r\nBut what does infidelity in someone elseâ\x80\x99s marriage
    have to do with me?\r\nWhy does a man I donâ\x80\x99t even know, a man who never
    made any commitments\r\nto me one way or another about the post-marital whereabouts
    of his\r\npecker, owe me an explanation, little less a mea culpa, when he sleeps\r\naround?
    In what way could I have understood his decision to play\r\nprofessional sport,
    or to represent me in parliament, as a solemn vow to\r\nme that heâ\x80\x99d be
    faithful to her? Why would I even care?\r\n\r\nI do care, of course, but for all
    the wrong reasons. I care because\r\nother peopleâ\x80\x99s dirty linen is compelling.
    I care because I am human and\r\nhumans are pack animals, forever compelled to
    see how our own lives\r\nmeasure up against leading others. I care because I am
    occasionally\r\nsmart enough to want to learn from the mistakes of others, rather
    than\r\nmy own, and in matters of the heart the best way to do this is to stick\r\nmy
    beak in where it doesnâ\x80\x99t belong.\r\n\r\nBut interested or not, it seems
    far-fetched-preposterous even-to suggest\r\nthat who a famous person pokes is
    my concern. That all high-profile\r\nadulterers owe me the who, what, when and
    where of all non-missionary\r\naspects of their sexual activity, not to mention
    a lavish apology\r\nwhenever that behaviour fails to measure up to a set of rigid
    Christian\r\nstandards to which I donâ\x80\x99t even subscribe. In what way is
    my life\r\naltered by Campbellâ\x80\x99s, Woodâ\x80\x99s or Sanfordâ\x80\x99s
    adultery? On the basis of\r\nwhat promise-implicit or explicit-can I honestly
    claim that it has\r\ncaused me embarrassment, disappointment or hurt?\r\n\r\nThe
    stocks and pillory brigade say itâ\x80\x99s not about the affair per se, but\r\nwhat
    it reveals about the public personâ\x80\x99s character or judgment. But\r\nsuch
    assertions donâ\x80\x99t hold up. Sure, marital infidelity may be\r\nindicative
    of poor character, but may also prove just the opposite. In a\r\nworld with hues
    other than black and white, David Campbellâ\x80\x99s decision to\r\ndefer the
    pursuit of a relationship in which his emotional and sexual\r\nneeds might be
    met in order to maintain his financial and other\r\ncommitments to his sick wife
    and kids could be judged laudible, not\r\nreprehensible.\r\n\r\nAnd while playing
    around is an undoubtedly high stakes game in a world\r\nwhere the media knows
    no bounds or limits, the charge of recklessness\r\nmay be an artifact of where
    the barâ\x80\x99s been set. The failure of some\r\npublic figures to measure up
    to a standard that says they must\r\ndemonstrate what conservative Christians
    would call exemplary behavior\r\nall the time may show theyâ\x80\x99re recklessness-a
    minor sin in any event-or\r\nprove only that such expectations are silly or unachievable
    for members\r\nof an imperfect race.\r\n\r\nSecond wave feminists understood that
    the personal was political. Over\r\nthe years this key insight has been bastardised
    in many ways. What was\r\nmeant was that to achieve liberation, women must recognise
    how political\r\nand social circumstances shape their individual experience.\r\n\r\nThe
    personal is political was never meant to suggest that every aspect\r\nof a public
    figureâ\x80\x99s life is fair game."
