    having fewer\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nLAST week the Prime Minister reopened the debate
    about Australiaâ\x80\x99s\r\npopulation. After years of Hanson-inspired silence,
    there are even\r\nwhispers of a bipartisan policy approach.\r\n\r\nDebates in
    Australia about population policy typically disintegrate into\r\nhaggling about
    migration numbers, and this time was no different.\r\nIndeed, some media outlets
    didnâ\x80\x99t even bother to report Howardâ\x80\x99s\r\ninterest in a comprehensive
    debate about population, while others gave\r\nonly a one-line mention to his open
    mind on population. Instead, the\r\nmedia focused on the Governmentâ\x80\x99s
    policy shift on migrant numbers.\r\n\r\nPopulation is not a synonym for migration,
    so why do politicians and the\r\nmedia constantly equate the two? More importantly,
    who loses out when\r\nthey do?\r\n\r\nThe size of our population is primarily
    determined by how many babies we\r\nhave. Over the past decade, Australiaâ\x80\x99s
    fertility rate has dropped\r\nprecipitously. Australian woman averaged 1.9 babies
    at the start of the\r\n1990s; by the end of the decade the figure was 1.75.\r\n\r\nWhat
    this means is that each year Australians move further away from\r\nbringing enough
    children into the world - around 2.1 per woman - to\r\nreplace the number of Australians
    dying.\r\n\r\nIn this, we are far from alone. Few Western countries have fertility\r\nlevels
    that are at or above replacement levels.\r\n\r\nYet despite sporadic fretting
    about declining fertility in the Western\r\nworld - an Italian demographer recently
    predicted the demise of the\r\nItalian people unless that country was able to
    halt the fall in its\r\nfertility rate - no committees are being assembled and
    research\r\ncommissioned to investigate the problem and propose policy solutions.\r\n\r\nOne
    reason is the difficulty in even gaining agreement that falling\r\npopulation
    is a problem. Some contend, among them the New South Wales\r\nPremier, Bob Carr,
    that our current numbers are overwhelming our fragile\r\necosystem and limited
    infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThose in favor of population growth tend to be economic
    rationalists\r\nconvinced that greater numbers will fuel economic prosperity and
    lift\r\nour international standing. In addition, patriarchal societies have long\r\nseen
    child-bearing as a womanâ\x80\x99s patriotic duty. As Jeff Kennett\r\ndiscovered,
    this can make any mention of the issue politically risky.\r\n\r\nIf declining
    fertility represented the desire of increasing numbers of\r\nwomen and men to
    have fewer children or no children at all, Iâ\x80\x99d fully\r\nsupport the current
    do-nothing-and-for-Godâ\x80\x99s-sake-donâ\x80\x99t-talk-about-it\r\napproach.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    what little data is available suggests that the steady decline\r\nin Australiaâ\x80\x99s
    birthrate since 1961 is evidence of the ever-widening gap\r\nbetween the number
    of children we want, and the number of children we\r\nhave.\r\n\r\nThe problem
    with falling population, in other words, is that it\r\nrepresents an erosion of
    womenâ\x80\x99s and menâ\x80\x99s freedom to embrace\r\nparenthood.\r\n\r\nFor
    instance, one study found that tertiary-educated Australian women in\r\ntheir
    20s intended to have an average of 2.3 children each, but as they\r\nmoved into
    their 30s, their expectations dropped sharply. At current\r\nrates, these women
    are not even likely to meet their lowered fertility\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\nLess
    educated women, while wanting on average just under two children\r\neach, come
    much closer to having the number they want. However, this may\r\nbe about to change.
    New figures from the Australian Institute of Family\r\nStudies show that while
    fertility rates are dropping for all women,\r\nthose of less educated women with
    poorer job prospects are declining\r\nquickest of all. What all this means is
    that the longstanding\r\nrelationship in developing countries between higher rates
    of female\r\neducation and lower rates of fertility doesnâ\x80\x99t explain fertility\r\npatterns
    in the developed world. It seems higher education and\r\nemployment levels donâ\x80\x99t
    lead women to want fewer children, but to have\r\nfewer than they want.\r\n\r\nThe
    reasons for this are not hard to guess. Getting educated takes time,\r\nand leads
    women to put off having children. Getting established in a\r\ncareer also takes
    time, and leads women to delay even longer. Getting so\r\nestablished at work
    that a woman is able to negotiate a family-friendly\r\nwork arrangement that wonâ\x80\x99t
    bankrupt her, turn her hair grey or put her\r\non the mummy track could conceivably
    - in a time of unequal opportunity\r\nand pay - take a lifetime.\r\n\r\nThe limited
    lifespan of female fertility means such delays may result in\r\na woman having
    fewer children than she intended, or no children at all.\r\n\r\nThe upshot of
    all this is that the incompatibility of child-bearing and\r\nchild-rearing with
    the demands of the lean and mean modern-day workforce\r\n- and the aggravation
    of that incompatibility by sex discrimination - is\r\nan issue that bears directly
    on the population question. No wonder\r\npoliticians are happy to restrict debates
    on population to questions of\r\nimmigration. Debates on the causes of declining
    fertility could make\r\narguments about migrant numbers look like fun.\r\n\r\nBut
    curtailment of this important debate comes at a high cost for\r\npresent and potential
    parents and children. So, as our political leaders\r\ngear up for the annual carry-on
    about migrant numbers, prospective and\r\nactual parents need to ensure their
    elected representatives canvass all\r\nthe causes and cures for our declining
    numbers.\r\n\r\nThe wellbeing of our families - and the existence of those we
    hope to\r\nhave - depends on it."
