    say â\x80\x9Cyesâ\x80\x9D. The destiny of the World Wide Web is to end\r\nhierarchical,
    corporate control over the content and dissemination of\r\nknowledge, and the
    glorious reality - as far as editorial and analysis\r\nis concerned - is nothing
    less than the liberation of the opinionated\r\nfrom the oppressive control of
    toady, petty and uncomprehending editors.\r\n\r\nSome Australian editors, not
    to mention relatively savvy members of the\r\nintelligentsia, appear to have bought
    the â\x80\x9Cend is nighâ\x80\x9D story, much as\r\nthey did the reports - greatly
    exaggerated it turned out - of the death\r\nof print news from the internet (and
    before that television) and the\r\ndeath of radio from podcasting.\r\n\r\nThe
    reality is that the net is the medium, not the message. Yes, the\r\nWorld Wide
    Web enables opinion and analysis to be distributed to\r\nconsumers in different
    ways. However, insofar as there really is an\r\naudience wanting to consume informed
    opinion and analysis, there is no\r\nlogical reason to suppose changes in the
    way such content can be\r\ndisseminated should impact in absolute terms - either
    negatively or\r\npositively - on demand for the content.\r\n\r\nCan personal blogs
    (web diaries or logs) posted free-of-charge on the\r\nweb meet this demand? Are
    they doing so already, increasingly\r\ncannibalising audiences which currently
    consume - and pay for either by\r\nsubscription or by viewing ads - editor-moderated
    opinion and analysis\r\non radio, TV, newspapers and news magazines distributed
    both in hard\r\ncopy and on line (enabling links and interactive reader comments)?\r\n\r\nWith
    one important caveat, my judgement on both questions is â\x80\x9Cnoâ\x80\x9D.
    When\r\nthey do their job well, editors provide a valuable service to time-poor\r\nreaders
    struggling to remain informed citizens in an information-dense\r\nworld. Valuable
    enough, that they will continue to seek it out and,\r\nwhere necessary, pay for
    it. That service is the sorting and selecting\r\nof opinion and analysis on the
    basis of priority (the top stories of the\r\nday), â\x80\x9Cmixâ\x80\x9D (diversity
    of subject) and quality (the best-written stories\r\nby the people most likely
    to know something about the issue). It also\r\nincludes packaging the product
    so it is visually appealing and - because\r\nparagraphs are plentiful, words are
    spelled properly and sentences are\r\ngrammatical - easy to read.\r\n\r\nPersonal
    blogs can be well written and provide considered and informed\r\nopinion by those
    with the experience and knowledge to offer consumers\r\nconsiderable insight into
    the subject to hand. However, once we get past\r\nthe giddiness of the gateless
    access available to both writers and\r\nreaders, we may be able to be honest enough
    to admit that some are\r\nsemi-literate rants by myopic, racist, sexist and and/or
    homophobic\r\ncretins with tickets on themselves and barrows to push. At least
    these\r\nare easy to spot. The blogs I worry about are those lacking the â\x80\x9Cdanger\r\nWill
    Robinsonâ\x80\x9D alert signs: written in spare and polished prose, posted\r\non
    expensive well-designed sites yet evidencing what can only be\r\ndescribed as
    a tenuous grasp of logic and a hostile relationship with\r\nthe facts.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, individuals with time to burn can do their own vetting of\r\nblogs on
    topics where they have enough expertise to know when someone\r\nelse is out of
    their depth (My education and experience allows me to\r\nspot a pseudo-feminist
    or a quack ethicist at 20 paces). However, like\r\nmost others, I am defenceless
    in the face of well-written views on\r\ntopics about which I am curious but largely
    uninformed. Editorial\r\noversight is one of the processes that prevents the publication
    of\r\nwell-packaged pseudo-knowledge - much of the time, anyway.\r\n\r\nWhich,
    amidst the now deafening howls of protest, takes me to the\r\ncaveat. Yes, vetting
    by editors is one process for guaranteeing us that\r\nsome degree of veracity
    attaches to the content we are spending our\r\nhard-earned time consuming, but
    it is not the only one. For proof of\r\nthis, we need look no further than the
    collective and demonstrably\r\nreliable editing process used to moderate contributions
    to online\r\nencyclopaedia. My claim is about the ongoing value in todayâ\x80\x99s
    world, and\r\nworlds to come, of moderated opinion and analysis, even in a\r\ncyber-universe
    where personal blogs are ubiquitous and priced to sell.\r\nCurrently, traditional
    editorial practices are one of the only ways\r\nweâ\x80\x99ve got to achieve reasonable
    levels of accuracy, veracity, and good\r\nclean copy. In the future, equally reliable
    ways may, and indeed are\r\npredicted, to emerge. Those that will be preferred
    by future consumers\r\nof analysis and opinion is anyoneâ\x80\x99s guess.\r\n\r\nBut
    here is mine.\r\n\r\nWhat contemporary blogophiles advance as the benefit of their
    preferred\r\nmedium is the weakness of opinion moderated by a handful of mostly
    pale,\r\nmale and stale editors. Blogs empower those marginalised or excluded
    by\r\ntraditional editorial gate-keeping processes. These include the young,\r\nthe
    female, the queer, the non-White and those from non-Christian\r\nbackgrounds:
    groups comprising growing minorities - and in some cases\r\noutright majorities
    - in Australian society\r\n\r\nIn the past, justice was the justificatory principle
    behind demands by\r\nsuch groups for greater representation in the creative engine
    room of\r\nAustralian culture, including among those who interpret the news. In
    the\r\nera of blogs, it may be proprietorial self-interest that finally sees\r\nthings
    change."
