    heralds is\r\nunnecessary at best and, at worst, a sexist menace.\r\n\r\nThe product
    is IntelliGender, a $95 urine test that claims to identify\r\nthe sex of a foetus
    from as early as eight weeks. It went on sale last\r\nSunday at some Australian
    chemists.\r\n\r\nIntelliGenderâ\x80\x99s tag line is, â\x80\x9CPink or blue, weâ\x80\x99ll

    raised doubts about the testâ\x80\x99s\r\ncapacity to reliably discern foetal
    sex. No reports on the science\r\nbehind it have appeared in the academic literature
    and even the company\r\nadmits that the 90 per cent accuracy achieved in clinical
    tests falls to\r\n82 per cent in real-world conditions.\r\n\r\nHow much this matters
    has everything to do with the real-world uses to\r\nwhich the test is put. If
    few buy it, and those that do see it as no\r\nmore than a bit of fun designed
    to get those nursery colour coordinates\r\nright, then who cares? But the worry
    is that in Australia, where\r\nabortion is a safe if not always lawful procedure,
    test results might\r\nnot be accurate, yet become the basis of a decision with
    legal, medical\r\nand ethical ramifications. This is different to home pregnancy
    tests,\r\nthe results of which are always validated prior to an abortion being\r\nundertaken
    or antenatal care commenced.\r\n\r\nBut the core ethical concerns raised by DIY
    sex-identification kits are\r\nabout more than informed decision-making. They
    take in the motives of\r\nusers and the consequences for all of us if skewed gender
    preferences\r\nare given free reign.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only way Australians
    can select their childâ\x80\x99s gender is\r\nto create embryos using IVF, then
    screen for sex prior to implantation.\r\nIn most Australian states, this technology
    can only be offered to\r\ncouples seeking to avoid the birth of a child with an
    inherited\r\ngender-linked disease such as haemophilia. Where the law is silent,\r\nmedical
    research and ethics guidelines - which tend to frown on use of\r\nthe technology
    for non-medical reasons - reign. In the past, there was a\r\nNSW clinic that offered
    embryo screening for medical reasons and to\r\nthose seeking to balance their
    family by having a child of a sex\r\ndifferent to their existing children but
    this service has now been\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe lack of outcry about such restrictions
    seems best explained by low\r\nlevels of desire to select gender for reasons other
    than avoiding\r\ndisease or family balancing.\r\n\r\nThe best predictor of couples
    who will try for a third child are those\r\nwith two children of the same sex,
    and surveys of Anglo and European\r\ncouples - Australian data is scarce - show
    low levels of interest in\r\nusing gender-selection technology. This is as it
    should be. Parents\r\nshould not have a general preference for one sex over the
    other\r\nvalidated, nor be allowed to turn such preferences into a skewed gender\r\nreality
    (most likely, a world in which more boys are born than girls).\r\nGender selection
    using IVF to avoid disease or balance genders in a\r\nfamily doesnâ\x80\x99t do
    this. Also, by compelling couples to turn up at\r\nclinics to access the technology,
    it makes possible the sort of\r\nmonitoring that would reveal straight away if
    couples were choosing more\r\nof one sex than the other.\r\n\r\nHome-based testing
    kits for foetal sex undercut informed\r\ndecision-making, trivialise gender-based
    childbearing decisions and\r\nrender their consequences - should the use of the
