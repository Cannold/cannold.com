  content: "Circular Quay on a sunny autumn day is a thing of great beauty. The harbour
    ripples diamond azure like a silken sheet, framed by icons at every angle. For
    all the cheesy postcards, the clichÃ©s and fatigued promotional footage, on the
    right day and with the right brain it is hard to imagine there is anywhere on
    Earth more sublime. Add to that a great big fuck-off platter of fresh seafood
    and the presence of an utterly enchanting media celebrity ethicist and your humble
    scribe is elevated to a plane of nirvana that losers like the Dalai Lama will
    never reach.\r\n\r\nWhen confronted by one of the countryâ\x80\x99s leading intellectuals,
    a woman who has appeared on every television show of note (and a few best left
    unnamed), written for every rag, done half the radio stations, authored both fiction
    and non-fiction books and championed the cause of womenâ\x80\x99s and childrenâ\x80\x99s
    rights without pause, itâ\x80\x99s possible to become a little unmanned.\r\n\r\nIn
    such circumstances itâ\x80\x99s best to concentrate on the little things, like
    the fact Leslie Cannold is a total sexpot with legs to die for.\r\n\r\nIt was
    my intention to conduct a professional journalistic interview, complete with insightful
    questions and hard-hitting candour. To this end Iâ\x80\x99d hurriedly purchased
    a cheap-arse Dictaphone and arrived with a bunch of source material, resplendent
    in my serious work suit and tie fresh off the rack from â\x80\x98DickheadsRUsâ\x80\x99.
    My intricate planning completely fell by the wayside the moment we met and the
    conversation instantly took on the hue of two old friends catching up. I donâ\x80\x99t
    think I asked a single question and Iâ\x80\x99d be surprised if it wasnâ\x80\x99t
    me who did most of the talking.\r\n\r\nThereâ\x80\x99s a kind of lemming optimism
    behind the smile as Leslie talks of her battles against religious interest groups.
    Womenâ\x80\x99s rights are on the table â\x80\x93 (nestled between the Murray
    salt and the Balsamic vinegar), â\x80\x9CAs soon as you win a round, as soon as
    the legislation is passed â\x80\x93 you know a new attack is being mounted,â\x80\x9D
    she fires between repeated refusals of alcohol. Sheâ\x80\x99s speaking again tonight
    and no manner of earthly temptation is going to blunt the knife, â\x80\x9CTheyâ\x80\x99re
    not lobbyists anymore, theyâ\x80\x99re part of the machine. They have mentor programs
    designed specifically to infiltrate all levels of government. Have you ever even
    heard of Arrow?â\x80\x9D I had not. Arrow is a program aimed at creating â\x80\x9Ccourageous
    leaders working towards a growing, vibrant Australian church that impacts (sic)
    the wider community.â\x80\x9D In short, it grooms up-and-coming, double-digit
    IQ right-wing religious whack-jobs, with the goal of setting them loose to pervert
    the parliamentary system and destroy the gauze-thin barriers between church and
    state. They donâ\x80\x99t lobby anymore. Thereâ\x80\x99s no need. Theyâ\x80\x99re
    already on the inside and they are bringing stupid to your home.\r\n\r\nIn the
    face of this, Leslie is undaunted. Sheâ\x80\x99s more disheartened by the restaurantâ\x80\x99s
    inability to provide acceptable coffee and the realisation that the prawns arenâ\x80\x99t
    shelled. â\x80\x9CYou canâ\x80\x99t surrender. You canâ\x80\x99t drop your guard,â\x80\x9D
    you canâ\x80\x99t peel a king prawn with a knife and fork either, but be fucked
    if sheâ\x80\x99s going to give up. I donâ\x80\x99t have the courage to intervene.
    I sip my beer and eat an oyster.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CIâ\x80\x99ve been doing this
    for a lot of years now and itâ\x80\x99s seemed like Iâ\x80\x99ve done nothing
    but tread water. Lately though, itâ\x80\x99s like Iâ\x80\x99ve become some sort
    of authority and thereâ\x80\x99s all this weight and expectation on what I say,â\x80\x9D
    she gets out through mouthfuls of some weird WA breed of yabby neither of us have
    eaten before. Far from conceit, she sounds like a young girl embarking on a career
    who canâ\x80\x99t quite work out where the years have gone, or how she ended up
    where she did, â\x80\x9CI get recognised in the street occasionally. The conversations
    are mostly really awkward.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThe meal and the conversation had drawn
    out some by this stage and Iâ\x80\x99d begun to discern something of a common
    thread in Leslieâ\x80\x99s conversation. Weâ\x80\x99d touched on so many diverse
    points it would take a whole magazine to cover them, yet behind it all there was
    something that united them all. It wasnâ\x80\x99t until we broached the topic
    of her novel that I started to work out what it was.\r\n\r\nDr Cannold is the
    author of two non-fiction books of some pretty great renown. The Abortion Myth
    is placed in high schools throughout the country. What, No Baby? has met with
    great acclaim, and is on the coffee table of every non-man-hating feminist in
    the country. Itâ\x80\x99s the mention of The Book of Rachael, however, that lights
    an opal fire behind Leslieâ\x80\x99s eyes.\r\n\r\nHer first work of fiction, it
    imagines the story of Jesusâ\x80\x99 sister, of whom no sacred texts make mention,
    â\x80\x9CI had never read the bible. In doing so, the story seemed to create itself,
    and I was merely putting voice to something I thought was meant to be told,â\x80\x9D
    Leslie says, â\x80\x9CI never thought that the idea of Mary being a virgin was
    taken literally by anyone. I realise now that some folk may get their noses out
    of joint.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThat, folks, is when it all tied together for me. This
    remarkable woman, this champion of human rights, celebrated author and burning
    intellect, this custodian of the public conscience has the heart of a child. She
    simply doesnâ\x80\x99t understand those who would seek to destroy her. Their motivations
    are incomprehensible in the face of truth she knows to be self-evident.\r\n\r\nOn
    our way to the train station we discussed her kids â\x80\x93 lovely both, but
    opposite in her eyes. One she foresees pursuing an academic career, one not. Both,
    in a motherâ\x80\x99s view, overwhelming in the amount of good they have ahead
    of them. Given their genes and environment, itâ\x80\x99s hard to imagine that
    they wonâ\x80\x99t both change the world in their own way.\r\n\r\nMaybe they have
    already.\r\n\r\n*Author Heath Callaway blogs regularly and splendidly at www.gibbot.wordpress.com
