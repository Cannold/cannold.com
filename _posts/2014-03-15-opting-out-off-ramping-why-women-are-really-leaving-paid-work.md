  content: "Words like \"desire\" and \"choice\" might be poor ways to describe circumscribed
    career moves that mothers make when trying to factor in childcare, writes Leslie
    Cannold.\r\n\r\nWith a steady diet of redundancies in the news, and economists
    beginning to talk of jobless recoveries, and even recession, it may be time to
    consider the prudence of decisions mothers make about paid work.\r\n\r\nIn particular,
    I want to cast a critical eye over claims that high-powered career women \"opt
    out\", or take the \"off-ramp\" entirely, to manage their childcare responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThe
    thesis comes from the United States, which is arguably further down the track
    than Australia in restructuring its economy in response to the loss of the secure
    decently-paid jobs that supported a middle-class.\r\nSylvia Anne Hewlett is an
    American researcher who has warned highly qualified women against opting out of
    the workforce to raise children.\r\n\"Off-ramps are around every curve in the
    road, but once a woman has taken one, on-ramps are few and far between - and extremely
    costly,\" she wrote in the Harvard Business Review in 2005.\r\n\r\nFive years
    later and Hewlett, writing again in the HBR, remained bamboozled by what she continued
    to see as the choice educated women make about paid work.\r\nWhile the number
    of women off-ramping had dropped from 37 per cent in 2005 to 31 per cent in 2010
    in the face of tough economic times, the recession had increased the amount of
    time women were staying at home (2.5 years up from 2). There was also a whopping
    28 per cent rise in the number of educated women living with an unemployed husband.\r\n\r\nThe
    persistence of off-ramping in the face of such trends, Hewlett said, suggested
    \"the non-linear path is not a luxury for boom times but the way many women want
    to structure their careers regardless of the economy\".\r\n\r\nWant, or - given
    gendered expectations of care and employment - must? A recent analysis of HILDA
    data by UNSW School of Management PhD student Tanya Carney suggests desire and
    choice are poor ways to describe the circumscribed career moves that mothers make.\r\n\r\nCarney
    tracked the employment transitions of mothers over a four-year period and contrasted
    them with the career moves of men and women without kids.\r\nIn yet unpublished
    findings, she found that mothers tended to cluster in jobs where there was security
    but also flexibility. That flexibility could come in the form of predictable work
    schedules and access to secure part-time work, or could consist of permanent full-time
    hours with the capacity to do some work from home.\r\n\r\nWomen also valued jobs
    that enabled them to downshift from permanent full- time work to part-time hours
    and ramp their hours back up when their caring responsibilities changed. Among
    the career winners were teachers, office managers, social welfare workers and
    personal assistants. Male-dominated professions from which mothers were fleeing
    included computing, accountancy finance professionals, business analysts and sales
    representatives.\r\n\r\nThis data marries well with the observations of American
    academic Deborah Kolb, who says there is little evidence to support claims that
    educated women are off-ramping or opting out by choice. Instead, the absence of
    the flexibility in their chosen professions is forcing such women from their perches.\r\nï¿¼\r\nOf
    course, secure flexible work is only part of the work-life balance equation. The
    other is accessible and affordable childcare. The National Foundation for Australian
    Women and economicSecurity4Women have been telling anyone who will listen that
    the political capital Prime Minister Tony Abbott is using to pass this generous
    paid parental leave scheme through Parliament would be far better spent on childcare
    reforms. Why? Because childcare has a \"much greater impact on the capacity of
    women to work and care than PPL (paid parental leave)\".\r\nThe data bears this
    out. Provisional unpublished results of the Government's own evaluation of the
    existing Paid Parental Leave Scheme suggests many women don't return to the workplace
    because they can't find childcare. Indeed, the two factors most critical to women's
    decision to return and remain in the paid workforce is whether they have good
    childcare and - when all is said and done under existing tax and transfer arrangements
    - whether they end up financially better off.\r\n\r\nI've written elsewhere about
    the sexism and classism deeply embedded in this sort of calculation. Here I want
    to focus on how government levers differently impact a mother's return to work
    depending on whether she has a university degree.\r\n\r\nIn a statistical analysis
    of 18 established democracies, including Australia, a group of Swedish researchers
    found that women with a tertiary education will stay in paid work regardless of
    the family-friendliness - or otherwise - of government policy. The reason? Their
    individual resources \"enable ... them to make real choices\", and the choice
    most women make when they have a range of good options and the freedom to choose
    among them is to stay in paid work.\r\n\r\nThis reality makes clear why advocacy
    group Chief Executive Women is struggling to find alliances in the women's movement
    to support their push to make the costs of nannies tax-deductible. Because unless
    a mother earns more than $180,000, a tax-deduction will leave her worse off than
    the current rebate. For those on the upper end of the pay scale, government fiscal
    levers have little influence on the decisions mothers make.\r\n\r\nBut those decisions
    can be influenced. If researchers Carney and Kolb are correct, the carrot for
    educated mothers is workplace flexibility. This is something largely in the hands
    of employers, but governments can play a role. As Carney points out, Australian
    workers \"currently have the right to request part-time work, not to get it\".\r\n\r\nIndeed,
    what Carney's work suggests is that what working mothers need is guaranteed entitlements
    to access a range of flexible practices that enable them to hang on, or at least
    retain a toe-hold in the workplace, while their kids are young.\r\n\r\nTony Abbott,
    over to you."
