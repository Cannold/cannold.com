    Itâ\x80\x99s a horrific image, a terrible crime.  But should it be a double homicide?\r\n\r\nThe
    debate about the rights of the unborn is set to rev up â\x80\x93 again â\x80\x93
    as South Australian Family First MP Robert Brokenshire prepares a Bill that declares
    it a crime to â\x80\x9Cdestroy the life ofâ\x80\x9D or do â\x80\x9Cgrievous bodily
    harm toâ\x80\x9D a foetus.\r\n\r\nLaws around foetuses vary from state to state.
    Queensland has recently expanded its laws, while a NSW review dismissed the need
    to. At one stage the Tasmanian Greens looked at whether a mother who smoked or
    drank to excess could be charged with child abuse.\r\n\r\nOf course, you canâ\x80\x99t
    start to talk about the legal status of an unborn child without also talking about
    abortion. As much as Family First would like to see abortion as a â\x80\x9Cred
    herringâ\x80\x9D, the very philosophical argument about what constitutes a person
    cannot help but cross over.\r\n\r\nIf the law says that itâ\x80\x99s a crime to
    hurt a foetus â\x80\x93 even if it specifies that itâ\x80\x99s only in the context
    of an illegal assault â\x80\x93 thereâ\x80\x99s then an obvious clash with the
    very idea of legal abortion.\r\n\r\nAnd Dr Leslie Cannold â\x80\x93 author, commentator,
    academic â\x80\x93 is right to point out that when the push to change the laws
    around foetuses come from Family First, you have to wonder what the bigger picture
    is. She said:\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s no accident that every time (these laws) get
    proposed itâ\x80\x99s by organisations like Family First who are known to be anti-choiceâ\x80¦
    theyâ\x80\x99ve gone at it directly before by attacking womenâ\x80\x99s right
    to choose, and now theyâ\x80\x99re going by the back door.\r\n\r\nMr Brokenshire
    does not want this to turn into an abortion debate, and says we should be â\x80\x9Cmature
    enoughâ\x80\x9D to keep it separate. Maybe he means â\x80\x9Ctrusting enoughâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nOn
    the surface of it, Mr Brokenshire makes a lot of sense. The community is and should
    be outraged if the additional horror of a dead foetus is seemingly ignored in
    an assault. Assaults occur on a scale, obviously. Theyâ\x80\x99re all bad. Some
    are worse than others. A pregnancy being deliberately ended when the woman wanted
    that baby would add to the seriousness of the assault.\r\n\r\nThe law should always
    recognise that. The consequences of the assault on the victim, the victimâ\x80\x99s
    family should be taken into account.\r\n\r\nBut there must be a way to do that
    without wading in to the murky waters. There must be a better way to do it, that
    perhaps in a broader sense helps victims of assault more generally by reflecting
    their pain, their experience, and the communityâ\x80\x99s expectations.\r\n\r\nPoliticians
    should have a grander aim than just a rapid-fire response to what is, really,
    a rare occurrence. They should be striving, constantly, to make sure that the
    legislation allows the judiciary to do what they should always be doing â\x80\x93
    ensuring justice is done. "
