    of Auditâ\x80\x99s recommendations on reducing the nationâ\x80\x99s spending.
    However, one piece of advice â\x80\x93 likely to be implemented â\x80\x93 has
    attracted scant notice. \r\n\r\nRecommendation 31 includes calls for â\x80\x9Cbetter
    manage[ment]â\x80\x9D of Australiaâ\x80\x99s overseas aid programme through an
    untying of aid spending to our Gross National Income, a limiting of any future
    aid increases to a rate no greater than that of inflation, and a focus in reporting
    and evaluating the success of spending focused on outcomes rather than â\x80\x9Cthe
    quantity of resources applied.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIn other words, forget about the
    promises recent political leaders of both stripes have made to boost Australiaâ\x80\x99s
    aid spend to .5 per cent of Gross National Income - a promise that falls far short
    of what is required of the worldâ\x80\x99s wealthier nations to meet the United
    Nationâ\x80\x99s Millennium Development Goals. \r\n\r\nThe Commissionâ\x80\x99s
    advice was as predictable as it is regrettable. Advice to politicians is â\x80\x93
    well, political - and development budgets and commitments are traditionally one
    of the first causalities when money is tight. \r\n\r\nThe reasons for this, says
    the Associate Director of the Indo-Pacific Governance Research Centre Andrew Rosser,
    is that domestic aid supporters are predominantly NGOs, church groups, aid contractors,
    and universities. These groups lack the economic and political clout of the business
    lobby and trade unions that gets their voices heard. In any event, a former Foreign
    Minister told Rosser, â\x80\x9CThere are no votes in aid.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nBut
    such analysis is the beginning of the story - not the end. \r\n\r\nYes, it would
    be wonderful if successive Australian governments kept their promises to dedicate
    a reasonable and reliable proportion of the nationâ\x80\x99s income to reversing
    the grinding poverty, hunger and disease of those living below the poverty line
    in places like East Timor, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands. \r\n\r\nCertainly,
    there are sound, practical reasons why they should. These include increasing Australiaâ\x80\x99s
    security and maintaining and expanding trade opportunities. Foreign development
    aid creates the connections, trust and goodwill that serves the national and commercial
    interests of today and tomorrow. \r\n\r\nBut we donâ\x80\x99t have to wait for
    Australian governments to act in the national interest when it comes to foreign
    development aid. We can do something to help our nearest neighbors now. We can
    choose to act not just because itâ\x80\x99s in the national interest, but because
    we care and helping those in need is the right thing to do. \r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s
    hard to overestimate how important it is to many Australians to feel they can
    make a difference about issues that matter to them. This is not surprisingly.
    Humans search for meaning and doing what we can to leave the world a better place
    then we found it is one way to find it. \r\n\r\nFor many, charity starts in the
    home or with neighbors. Such locally-oriented givers feel best when they are assured
    their contribution got where it was going, and made a difference they can see.
    But even those with a more national or international focus want to know their
    doing the right thing and their efforts arenâ\x80\x99t being lost to corruption
    or inefficiency. \r\n\r\nIncreasingly, philanthropists want to actively contribute
    to change, not just send cash. A hands-on approach asks more of the giver, but
    is worth it. Giving to others is - for all but psychopaths - one of the surest
    routes to fulfillment and happiness. \r\n\r\nSo what should we do in the face
    of what could be significant cuts to Australiaâ\x80\x99s development aid?\r\n\r\nMy
    advice is donâ\x80\x99t get cynical, depressed or angry. Instead, get active!
    \r\n\r\nTake the challenge of living below the poverty line, fast or do it in
    a dress. If youâ\x80\x99re time poor or unwell, donâ\x80\x99t worry. She who doesnâ\x80\x99t
    try to do everything does something. Thereâ\x80\x99s nothing wrong at this time
    of your life with signing and sharing petitions or donating to those able to do
    more.\r\n\r\nBe inspired. I like the story of the young Aussies who dared one
    another to try eating on less than $2 a day after theyâ\x80\x99d toured the slums
    of Bangladesh together. These young men were so radicalized by the understanding
    the challenge gave them of living below the poverty line, they started what became
    a global movement to raise money for the poor.  \r\n\r\nMake changing the world
    your bread and butter. Think of Anita Roddick whose tiny cosmetic shop in Britain
    built on the principle of social and environmental change became the world-wide
    Body Shop chain. Or Muhammad Yunus, founder of Grameen Bank, provides the poor
    in India with micro-finance to start a business. \r\n\r\nWe canâ\x80\x99t let
    our individual moral priorities be determined by what our government does or doesnâ\x80\x99t
    do. Each of us has the power to make a difference to this world by being the change
    we want to see right here and now. \r\n\r\n*Dr Leslie Cannold is an ambassador
