    with colour and authentic\r\nunderstanding of place, The Catch by first-time author
    Marg Vandeleur\r\nmaintains its innocence and light-heartedness on a potentially\r\nchin-dragging
    topic: the shortage of suitable men for\r\ndesperately-ticking women.\r\n\r\nAt
    close to 36, curvaceous and pleasantly placid Colette (Letty) is\r\nfeeling her
    eggs age as she struggles to recover from a break-up with\r\nher longstanding
    philandering boyfriend, and to find a suitable man with\r\nwhom to produce the
    baby for which she longs. A longing that she\r\nattempts, though fails, to adequately
    explain to her child-indifferent\r\nbest friend, an insouciant lesbian novelist
    named Jules:\r\n\r\nNo Jules didnâ\x80\x99t feel it. Perhaps that was where her
    ease, her lightness,\r\ncame from. The longing for a baby weighted Letty down.
    It was an\r\nundertow to her existence. The further from her grasp it slipped,
    the\r\nmore intense the churning.\r\n\r\nAfter a somewhat predictable romp for
    a suitable man through Melbourneâ\x80\x99s\r\ntragic dating scene (where angry
    divorced men and pathologically shy\r\nones fail to arrest her attention), Letty
    discovers that itâ\x80\x99s no stroll\r\nthrough the park finding a suitable donor
    amongst paternity-longing gay\r\nmen either. But finally Jules hits gold and introduces
    her to her match,\r\nthe queenly and caring Robert. Having abandoned the noisy
    landmark\r\nFitzroy street cafe Marios as a suitable site for the initial meet
    and\r\ngreet, she and Jules set the rendezvous at a pub across the street from\r\na
    pram-packed park. Robert is quick to list his qualifications for the\r\njob:\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99m
    kind. Iâ\x80\x99m not the smartest guy in the world, but Iâ\x80\x99m not dumb\r\neither.
    I find little things amusing. Iâ\x80\x99ve always wanted a baby and now\r\nmy
    clock is ticking double-time. Iâ\x80\x99d make a lovely father. And Iâ\x80\x99ve
    had\r\nall the tests. Iâ\x80\x99ve got about seven hundred thousand billion sperm
    or\r\nsomething like that. A lot.\r\n\r\nNever self-indulgent, or obviously politically
    correct (the narrativeâ\x80\x99s\r\nattaching of parental longing to both straight
    and gay men and women\r\ndeftly undermines any essentialist understanding of Lettyâ\x80\x99s
    quest),\r\nVandeleur paints a picture of the quintessential modern woman facing
    the\r\nâ\x80\x9CWhat, no baby?â\x80\x9D problem. The problem faced by too many
    educated,\r\ninteresting, and accomplished Australian women in finding the right
    sort\r\nof man to love and share the work and sacrifices of parenting before the\r\nsands
    of their fertile years run out.\r\n\r\nBut while Lettyâ\x80\x99s arduous journey
    through donor selection and\r\nself-impregnation leave us with no illusions about
    the significant\r\nâ\x80\x9Ccatchâ\x80\x9D attached to the desires of single women
    for motherhood, and\r\nLetty makes no bones bones about her desire to â\x80\x9Ccatchâ\x80\x9D
    the right man,\r\nneither does she intend to be â\x80\x9Ccaughtâ\x80\x9D in any
    old relationship simply\r\nbecause she knows her time is running out. Her self-esteem
    so\r\nfundamental to who she is as to need no remark, Letty understands - and\r\nproceeds
    on the principle - that she is better off parenting a donor-bub\r\nalone then
    partnered to a man who doesnâ\x80\x99t attract her physically and\r\nemotionally
    (her pet hate is scuffed shoes with a business suit). Itâ\x80\x99s\r\nhard not
    to like Letty as she doggedly pursues her maternal dreams\r\nthrough â\x80\x9CWeekly
    Weighersâ\x80\x9D and several failed pregnancy attempts without\r\nlosing her
    sense of humour, proportion, or compassion for the various\r\ntrials of her gang
    of colourful friends.\r\n\r\nHer emotional needs met by her friends, her financial
    by her own\r\nstart-up business, Letty seems to demonstrate the truth of recent\r\nresearch
    findings that while women still want me, they donâ\x80\x99t need them.\r\nAnd
    it is the gap between what women desire, and men are willing or able\r\nto produce
    - at least for those in the current â\x80\x9Ctransitionalâ\x80\x9D generation\r\nlike
    Letty - that is causing all the angst."
