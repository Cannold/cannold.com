    than the ACT, and Victoria (if they are not more than 24 weeks pregnant) and -
    in a more compromised fashion and only up to 20 weeks pregnancy - Western Australia.\r\n\r\nI
    want to be really clear about this. In most states, including the populous states
    of Queensland and NSW, women do NOT have a right to choose. They are not lawfully
    empowered to decide for themselves if they will  continue or terminate their pregnancy.
    Instead, the law places the decision in the hands of one or even two doctors.
    In all places but Victoria and the ACT, all or part of the law governing abortion
    is found in the crimes act or criminal code. In Queensland and NSW it appears
    in a near identical form to that found in an 1861 English statute, reformed long
    ago in that country. That wording specifies that abortion is a crime punishable
    by jail.\r\n\r\nBut wait a minute, you might say. I've had an abortion or a friend
    or cousin or sister has had one. Just there, at the local clinic? So how can abortion
    be a crime?\r\n\r\nThere are a number of explanations for this extremely confusing
    state of affairs, but I will focus on just one, That is the excuses either written
    into the criminal code itself and/or developed as a consequence of judicial rulings
    made in cases where a medical practitioner was charged with procuring an unlawful
    abortion and hauled into court. These excuses tend to focus on the word \"unlawfully\"
    in the criminal statute, and go about prescribing the sort of reasons that a person
    charged with the crime of intending to procure an abortion or knowledgeably supplying
    the means to someone intending to procure must have to render their action lawful.
    These vary from state to state but in essence, come down to a claim by the abortion
    provider that s/he formed a reasonable belief that the abortion was necessary
    to preserve the woman's life or her physical or mental health.\r\n\r\nOne thing
    worth pointing out is that that a woman charged with unlawful abortion has no
    recourse to the excuse that I have just described and tends to be known as \"the
    necessity\" defence. It is not open to her to say I formed a reasonable belief
    that the abortion was necessary to preserve my life, my physical or mental health.
    These excuses are for exclusive benefit of the provider.\r\n\r\nMoreover, nowhere
    in Australia does the law address the refusal of Catholic hospitals to provide
    abortion services. As the church's episcopal vicar for life and health, Anthony
    Fisher, made plain in 2009: ''Catholic health-care institutions, whatever legal,
    financial or other pressure they are under, may not co-operate with abortion.\"\r\n\r\nThis
    situation is disturbing because 21 of the nation's taxpayer-funded public hospitals
    are run by Catholic Health Australia. In some rural and regional areas such institutions
    are the only game in town. Even more sobering when you understand that the refusal
    of Catholic hospitals to provide abortion services is not something disclosed
    to women when they arrive in casualty or book in as maternity patients.\r\n\r\nI
    am not blaming Catholic Healthcare providers, who are pretty plain about the religious
    limits placed on their ability to provide gender egalitarian healthcare. To me,
    blaming them for this is like blaming a leopard for having spots. To me is seems
    clear that the onus of responsibility for the shocking abortion laws that prevail
    in most jurisdictions â\x80\x93 shocking in what they contain and fail to contain
    - lies clearly and squarely with our elected representatives.\r\n\r\nAll of this
    goes to the point I wish to make about the most common response that lawmakers
    give to medical practitioners and abortion rights activists who want the law to
    change. That response is that it ain't broke, so why fix it.\r\n\r\nThe law's
    lack of clarity, its paternalism, the profound disconnect between it and community
    standards about privacy, gender equity and the entitlement of patients to ethical
    and professional medical care unequivocally demonstrates that it is indeed broke.\r\n\r\nThe
    charging of Cairns couple Tegan Leach, 19, and Sergie Brennan, 21, in 2009 with
    abortion-related crimes was a game changer. Here, at last, was incontrovertible
    proof that not only did the law of abortion denigrate, patronise and discriminate
    against Australian women, it also put them and their partners at very real risk
    of being charged, tried, convicted and sent to jail for undertaking what the World
    Health Organisation says is \"one of the safest medical procedures.\"\r\n\r\nThe
    Cairns case also exposed how confused Australians of reproductive age such as
    Leach and Brennan are about the laws of abortion that reign in their state or
    territory. How many Australians, perhaps even most, mistake the relative availability
    of safe abortion services as evidence that abortion is no longer a crime?\r\n\r\nThe
    Queensland case also shone a desperately needed light on the two-faced, cowed
    and cowardly nature of Australian politicians when it comes to this critical area
    of women's  health. The way in which \"the nation's leaders\" promise activists
    the moon before an election, but once they win turn their backs on their female
    constituents â\x80\x93 half of any electorate - in favour of pandering to a tiny
    fundamentalist minority.\r\n\r\nQueensland Premier Anna Bligh ignored the gift-wrapped
    political opportunities the prosecution of Brennan and Leach offered to spearhead
    law reform. Bligh worked actively behind the scenes to stymie all attempts by
    backbenchers to bring forward a private member's bill to reform the law. Indeed,
    according to former Labor MP Bonny Barry, the numbers for successful abortion
    law reform in Queensland were there when she came into the Parliament, and were
    still there years later, when Bligh took over.\r\n\r\nMercifully, the Cairns couple
    was acquitted. The verdict was founded on the conclusion that neither of the legal
    and widely-used pharmaceuticals used in Tegan's medical abortion were \"noxious\"
    to the woman â\x80\x93 a key word in the criminal statute. Consequently, the jury
    concluded her abortion was not unlawful. But what this ruling tells us about what
    the current law of abortion is in Queensland is anyone's guess. Some have speculated
    the judgment removes medical abortion â\x80\x93 that procured through pills â\x80\x93
    from the reach of the criminal code, though surgical abortion remains a crime.
    Others disagree, including some of the providers who have yet to resume service
    levels prevailing before the couple were charged.\r\n\r\nSuch confusion is par
    for the course.  One survey, done in 2004, found that 37 per cent of GPs feel
    they don't fully understand the abortion laws that prevail in their jurisdiction.
    Worse, many of the GPs who think they understand the laws are mistaken. For instance,
    they don't believe a GP referral is required when it may be, or they think severe
    fetal abnormality constitutes grounds for lawful abortion in their jurisdiction
    when it doesn't. The lack of clarity of much abortion law sees doctors regularly
    misinforming women about their capacity to access services and is patently unfair
    to the women and medical practitioners who â\x80\x93 as the Leach and Brennan
    case shows â\x80\x93 face a very real risk of prosecution if they get it wrong.\r\n\r\nIn
    conclusion and not to put too fine a point on it, abortion law in much of Australia
    is a real shlemozzle.\r\n\r\nWhat I hope all this has convinced you of that most
    of the laws in this country on abortion should be repealed, pulled out of the
    criminal law and regulated like all other medical procedures."

--- "Australian women do not, in law, have a right to choose in any state other than
