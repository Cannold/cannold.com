  content: "*Pregnancies Donâ\x80\x99t Need Support, Women Do*\r\n\r\nAnyone who followed
    the debate on RU486, and understood the\r\ncomplex politics surrounding it, knew
    it was coming: a quid pro quo for\r\nthe Health Minister to soften the blow of
    losing his powers to deny\r\nAustralian women access to RU486. It came last Thursday:
    a $51 million\r\ndollar package for two [pregnancy support measures]() a new counselling\r\nhotline
    and Medicare rebate. Then came the story of a push in Victoria\r\nto remove abortion
    from the Crimes Act.\r\n\r\nCounselling is like motherhood: something few want
    to oppose. But the\r\ntruth is that some counselling isnâ\x80\x99t what is seems.
    Far from improving\r\nthe quality of womenâ\x80\x99s decisions, mental health
    or lives, biased\r\ncounselling - funded by the Commonwealth to the tune of $350,982
    - can\r\ncause lasting damage to womenâ\x80\x99s lives and mental health. Sadly,
    it\r\nappears that this is precisely the sort of â\x80\x9Ccounsellingâ\x80\x9D
    the Federal\r\nGovernment has in mind.\r\n\r\nThere is one key feature that attaches
    to all legitimate counselling:\r\nthe commitment to fostering a womanâ\x80\x99s
    autonomy. At the heart of all\r\nethical medical practice, you will find the key
    value of autonomy, the\r\nGreek root of which means â\x80\x9Cself-ruleâ\x80\x9D.
    Why? Because only people free to\r\ndirect and govern their lives according to
    their own values are\r\nrecognised by others as having what Australian philosopher
    Robert Young\r\ndescribes as â\x80\x9Cthe dignity that moral agency bestowsâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nThere
    are three reasons to doubt that the Governmentâ\x80\x99s proposed measures\r\nwill
    foster womenâ\x80\x99s autonomy and protect their dignity. The first is\r\nthat,
    as their title makes clear, they are designed to support\r\npregnancies, not women.
    If pregnancy maintenance, not quality\r\ndecision-making, is the name of the game,
    itâ\x80\x99s hard to see how factually\r\naccurate and non-directive support and
    advice is on the cards.\r\n\r\nDitto the undisguised aim of both measures: to
    reduce the abortion rate.\r\nThe Government says they are necessary to address
    Australiaâ\x80\x99s high\r\nabortion rate. At the news conference launching the
    plan, the Prime\r\nMinister said: â\x80\x9CWe donâ\x80\x99t like the number of
    abortions. We think itâ\x80\x99s too\r\nhigh.â\x80\x9D How can a service designed
    to stop women having abortions (how\r\nelse to reduce the abortion rate?) provide
    impartial, non-directive\r\nadvice? How can such a service meet the ethical requirement
    of promoting\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99s autonomy? Wonâ\x80\x99t the successful tenderer
    be evaluated on how well\r\nit achieves the Governmentâ\x80\x99s aims of reducing
    the abortion rate? If so,\r\nhow can we expect this service to do anything other
    than discourage\r\nwomen from choosing abortion?\r\n\r\nThis worry is exacerbated
    by the Governmentâ\x80\x99s insistence that religious\r\norganisations will be
    eligible to tender for the telephone helpline\r\ncontract. While abortion service-providers
    and counsellors working in\r\nabortion clinics have been seen as having a â\x80\x9Cconflict
    of interestâ\x80\x9D that\r\nrenders them incapable of providing impartial, non-directive
    support and\r\nreferral for all three options available to pregnant women - abortion,\r\nadoption
    and continuing - religious providers are not. This beggars\r\nbelief, particularly
    given the widespread acceptance of medical\r\nconscientious objection not just
    to providing abortion services, but\r\nreferring women to someone who will.\r\n\r\nMoral
    conflicts of interest are as real as financial ones, and there is\r\nlittle doubt
    that a tender process truly committed to identifying a\r\nservice committed to
    fostering womenâ\x80\x99s autonomy would rule out\r\napplicants with religious
    or philosophical objections to abortion.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that if the Government
    wants to reduce the abortion rate,\r\nthe most ethical and effective approach
    is to tackle unplanned\r\npregnancies. No woman wants to be pregnant when she
    feels unable -\r\nbecause she is unemployed, homeless, single, living in a violent
    home or\r\nis just a teenager herself - to be a good and responsible parent to
    the\r\nchild. This makes government support for education and contraception\r\naccess
    programs not only the most effective way to lower the abortion\r\nrate, but -
    because it supports women to achieve shared aims - the only\r\nethical one.\r\n\r\nPregnancies
    donâ\x80\x99t need support, women do. They also need respect. The\r\naim of any
    legitimate counselling service must be to foster womenâ\x80\x99s\r\nautonomy,
    not to achieve government aims such as reducing the number of\r\nabortions or
    increasing the birthrate. Using women as a means to\r\ngovernment or church ends
    is not just unethical, it may lead to women\r\nbeing deceived or induced - perhaps
    even coerced through false\r\ninformation or an absence of timely advice - into
    having an unwanted\r\nchild: not a recipe for happy families.\r\n\r\nIf a financial
    conflict of interest is seen to render those involved\r\nwith abortions ineligible
    to provide impartial advice, support and\r\nreferral for all three options with
    an unplanned pregnancy, a moral\r\nconflict of interest surely rules religious
    and pro-life providers out,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nAt a minimum, the potential for abuse
    of trust must be acknowledged. It\r\nis likely that women will assume that neutrally
    named services,\r\nparticularly when promoted with the Australian coat of arms,
    will\r\nsupport them to make a choice consistent with their situation and\r\nvalues.
    If the agency running the helpline has a religious or\r\nphilosophical objection
    to abortion, women need to be informed of this\r\non all advertising materials.\r\n\r\nThey
    must also be told it when they ring. And offered an alternative\r\nnumber for
    a legitimate service. One that has no other agenda than\r\nassisting her to make
    the choice that is right for her, and no religious\r\nbeliefs to limit the support
    they provide for her to carry it out."
