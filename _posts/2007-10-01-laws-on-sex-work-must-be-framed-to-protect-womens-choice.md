    since the state governmentâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9Ctolerance zoneâ\x80\x9D policy for\r\nstreet
    sex work went down in flames five years ago, the West Australian\r\ngovernmentâ\x80\x99s

    a feminist academic and long-time St Kilda resident, Iâ\x80\x99ve been\r\nthinking
    about these issues for a long time. Only recently, however,\r\nhave I arrived
    at what I think is a fair and sensible approach to the\r\nissue, one that recognises
    women as moral agents capable of accepting\r\nboth the rights and responsibilities
    associated with selling sex.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this.\r\n\r\nAdvocates and opponents
    of decriminalisation adopt extreme\r\ncharacterisations of women to justify their
    positions. On one side are\r\nthe decriminalisation advocates - self-proclaimed
    unions or advocacy\r\ngroups for prostitutes - who contend that sex work is a
    job like any\r\nother, that women have a right to perform this â\x80\x9Cworkâ\x80\x9D
    whenever and\r\nwherever they like, and that society is obliged to regulate to
    protect\r\nsell-sellers from the inherent risks associated with having serial
    sex\r\nwith unknown men.\r\n\r\nIn the opposing corner are the radical feminists
    and members of the\r\nreligious right. For this unholy alliance, prostitution
    is always a\r\nviolent and exploitative encounter that, by definition, no competent\r\nwoman
    would ever choose to participate in. As two Norwegian scientists\r\nput it, â\x80\x9Cno-one
    wants to rent out her vagina as a garbage can for hordes\r\nof anonymous menâ\x80\x99s
    ejaculationsâ\x80\x9D. Dismissing with an imperious hand-wave\r\nthe claims of
    some prostitutes that they freely choose to sell their\r\nbodies, real and pseudo
    radical feminists and religious wowsers persist\r\nin describing all sex-sellers
    as victims whom they must protect by\r\npromulgating and enforcing no- tolerance
    policies.\r\n\r\nThe victim-approach to managing street prostitution is objectionable
    on\r\na number of grounds. These include its obnoxious paternalism, and the\r\ndisingenuous
    way in which political agitation designed to impose the\r\nagitatorâ\x80\x99s
    view of what is best on everyone else is dressed up as\r\nselfless â\x80\x9Cfeministâ\x80\x9D
    advocacy on behalf of women. But most offensive is\r\nthe way in which the argument
    itself victimises sex-sellers by denying\r\ntheir experience and stripping them
    of their agency. Such\r\nobjectification allows the no-tolerance posse to dismiss
    everything\r\nsex-sellers say about their experience - when they donâ\x80\x99t
    say things that\r\nsupport the no-tolerance position - as false consciousness
    or further\r\nevidence of victimhood. For instance, Gunilla Ekberg, the co-executive\r\ndirector
    of the International Coalition Against Trafficking in Women,\r\nexplains the support
    some prostitutes give to decriminalization as\r\nevidence of their desire to â\x80\x9Cdefend
    their own dignityâ\x80\x9D in a violent\r\ncontext that â\x80\x9Cthey canâ\x80\x99t
    changeâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nAbandoning the all or nothing approach, and recognizing
    the indisputable\r\nfact that some women do choose to sell sex, while others donâ\x80\x99t,\r\nincarnates
    a realistic and fair approach for the management of indoor\r\nand outdoor sex
    in liberal democracies. A position where sex sellers are\r\nmoral agents worthy
    of respect - instead of pitiable victims in need of\r\npaternalistic protection
    - that have both rights and responsibilities\r\nwith regard to how they ply their
    trade. Insofar as the consequences of\r\ntheir choice to sell sex remains with
    them, competent adult women (and\r\nmen) should be free to sell their bodies,
    however strongly some in the\r\ncommunity object. However, like other choosers,
    when the consequences of\r\nthe selling choice restricts the capacity of fellow
    citizens to exercise\r\ntheir freedoms, the state is obligated to restrict their
    activity.\r\n\r\nA focus on autonomous choice also justifies state intervention
    where sex\r\nworkers lack the capacity - because they are too young, mentally
    ill,\r\nsexually or physically abused or drug addicted - to make choices about\r\nselling
    sex that are worthy of the name.\r\n\r\nWhat this cashes out to are policies that
    decriminalize and\r\nconstructively regulate indoor prostitution, and prohibit
    street\r\nsolicitation and sex. Behind this approach is a rebuttable presumption\r\nthat
    adult women who sell sex are autonomous, and that communities\r\naffected by street
    sex suffer an unjustified loss of amenity and\r\nsecurity. Such policies address
    the very real potential for exploitation\r\nand coercion in the sex trade by offering
    sex-sellers real opportunities\r\nto exit like income support, places in drug
    rehabilitation programs and\r\npolice intervention in violent relationships at
    regular intervals at\r\ntheir â\x80\x9Cworkplacesâ\x80\x9D and each time they
    have contact with the law. The\r\navailability of such programs to women working
    indoors should give us\r\nconfidence that sellers are choosing this way of life,
    while offering\r\nstreet prostitutes - when combined with fines and jail terms
    for punters\r\n- a real opportunity to either move inside or to exit the trade.\r\n\r\nWomen
    who are truly moral agents must accept both the rights and\r\nresponsibilities
    that accompany their choices. I think it vital that\r\npublic language and policy
    concerning women - particularly as sexual and\r\nreproductive beings - validate
    us as citizens capable of both making\r\nchoices, and living with their consequences.
    Autonomous adult women have\r\na right to sell sex providing they go about it
    in ways that donâ\x80\x99t\r\nunfairly burden the community of which they are
    a part, though as a\r\ncommunity we have a positive obligation to ensure that
    at every stage of\r\nwhat is potentially a violent, exploitative and coercive
    game a womanâ\x80\x99s\r\nfreedom to say â\x80\x9Cnoâ\x80\x9D is protected.\r\n\r\nThis
    is why allowing brothels to operate in a regulated fashion is a\r\ngood idea,
    but street sex work can never be tolerated. Not just because\r\na disproportionate
    number of street prostitutes are too young, too\r\ndrug-addicted, too psychologically
    scarred or cowed by violence or abuse\r\nto make an autonomous choice to sell
    themselves, but because the cost to\r\nthe community of their behaviour, even
    if theirs is a choice worthy of\r\nthe name, is far too high."
