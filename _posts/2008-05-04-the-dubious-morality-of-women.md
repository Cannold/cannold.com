    by delaying\r\nchildbirth.\r\n\r\nAnd that was just this week.\r\n\r\nDoubts about
    womenâ\x80\x99s moral agency date back to the Greeks. Plato argued\r\nthat â\x80\x9Cwomenâ\x80\x99s
    nature is inferior to that of men in capacity for virtueâ\x80\x9D\r\nand so more
    inclined to â\x80\x9Csecrecy and stealth.â\x80\x9D More than 2000 years\r\nlater,
    Freud argued that womenâ\x80\x99s psychosexual development meant that\r\nwomen
    â\x80\x9Cshow less sense of justice than men.â\x80\x9D In the late 1950s, a\r\nsoon-to-be
    influential moral psychologist named Lawrence Kohlberg\r\ndeveloped a six stage
    model of moral development that suggested it was\r\nno accident that the Gandiâ\x80\x99s
    and Martin Luther Kingâ\x80\x99s of the world were\r\nmen. Women, because of an
    overemphasis on maintaining relationships,\r\nfailed to progress to the highest
    stages of judgement where\r\nrelationships were subordinated to rules and, ultimately,
    to universal\r\nprinciples of justice.\r\n\r\nBut hereâ\x80\x99s the problem.
    The empirical evidence not only fails to support\r\nthe â\x80\x9Cmen are more
    moralâ\x80\x9D thesis, but suggests the truth is the other way\r\naround. A recent
    study of the giving habits of Americans found that\r\nwomen not only make more
    charitable contributions than men, they are far\r\nless likely than men to give
    because they can earn a tax deduction. Or\r\nthe findings of a study presented
    at a recent International Studies\r\nAssociation conference that the higher the
    percentage of women in\r\nlegislatures, the more likely states were to use foreign
    aid, not\r\nmilitary spending or conflict escalation, to achieve their aims. We
    also\r\nknow that when it comes to education, women in the developing world are\r\nthe
    target for intervention because, as Greg Mortenson, the American who\r\nhas dedicated
    his life to building schools for girls in impoverished\r\nareas of Pakistan and
    Afghanistan puts it, â\x80\x9CIf you educate a boy, you\r\neducate an individual.
    If you educate a girl, you educate a community.â\x80\x9D\r\nThe same goes for
    development aid that focuses on women because, says\r\nthe Equilibrium Fund, â\x80\x9Cimproving
    conditions for women results in\r\nimproved conditions for the entire family.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nDoes
    this mean every woman is a saint, and more saintly than a man? Of\r\ncourse not,
    but what it does suggest is that if you had to pick winners,\r\nyouâ\x80\x99d
    pick a woman every time.\r\n\r\nBut raising the moral superiority of women is
    a double-edged sword.\r\nAuthor Julia Baird says that the â\x80\x9Cassumptionâ\x80¦that
    women are cleaner,\r\nmore ethical than menâ\x80¦has been their greatest burden.â\x80\x9D
    The higher the\r\npedestal, the harder the fallâ\x80\x94just ask Carmen Lawrence
    and Cheryl\r\nKernot.\r\n\r\nSo perhaps we can agree to this. Men can stop insulting
    womenâ\x80\x99s imagined\r\nmoral failings, and women will agree to keep mum about
