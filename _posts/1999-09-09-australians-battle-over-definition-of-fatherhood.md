    for the definitive answer to the vexing question: Who are dads\r\nanyway? The

    the latter, can the law insist each child have one?\r\n\r\nThe Womenâ\x80\x99s
    Electoral Lobby here recently made history when it became\r\nthe first womenâ\x80\x99s
    organization ever to be granted leave by the nationâ\x80\x99s\r\nHigh Court (the
    Australian equivalent of the U.S. Supreme Court) to\r\nintervene on behalf of
    women. The group will be arguing against no less\r\nan adversary than the Catholic
    Church in a case that will decide whether\r\nthe nationâ\x80\x99s single women
    will have the option of becoming mothers\r\nthrough modern technology.\r\n\r\nThe
    case is set to continue on Friday, with the Judge insisting it be\r\nresolved
    no later than September 2001.\r\n\r\nThe Victorian federal court had previously
    ruled in what is called the\r\nMcBain decision that the stateâ\x80\x99s denial
    of fertility treatments, such as\r\nin vitro fertilization and donor sperm, to
    single women on the grounds\r\nof their martial status violated Australiaâ\x80\x99s
    own Sex Discrimination Act,\r\nas well as international agreements to which Australia
    is a signatory.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Church is arguing the decision should be overturned
    and the\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99s lobby is urging the court to uphold the stateâ\x80\x99s
    ruling.\r\n\r\nLaw May Pass in Parliament to Overrule High Court\r\n\r\nHot on
    the heels of the state courtâ\x80\x99s McBain ruling, the lower house of\r\nthe
    Australian parliament passed a bill attempting to undo it by\r\nauthorizing the
    Australian states to discriminate against single women\r\nby denying them access
    to donor sperm.\r\n\r\nWhile two of the countryâ\x80\x99s three major parties,
    Labor and the Democrats,\r\noppose the bill, the decision by two Labor senators
    to abstain means it\r\nmay still become law. The Liberal government continues
    to support it on\r\nthe grounds that children have a right to a â\x80\x9Cmother
    and a father by\r\nbeing conceived into a marriage or de facto relationship involving
    a man\r\nand a woman.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nBut are the Catholic bishops and the Australian
    government really\r\nworried about the rights of children, or those of fathers?\r\n\r\nIt
    may surprise people to know that the law has long held marriage to be\r\nthe true
    test of fatherhood. Paternal rights are accorded to the\r\nmotherâ\x80\x99s husband,
    regardless of whether her child is his biological\r\nprogeny, although society
    has long attempted to ensure the legal father\r\nis also the biological father
    by socially and legally discriminating\r\nagainst â\x80\x9Cillegitimateâ\x80\x9D
    children and â\x80\x9Cunmarriedâ\x80\x9D mothers.\r\n\r\nIn the last few decades,
    declining rates of marriage and rising numbers\r\nof divorces and extramarital
    births have exerted pressure on\r\nmarriage-based definitions of fatherhood. This
    is evidenced by the\r\nincreasing willingness of governments to use DNA tests
    to establish a\r\nmanâ\x80\x99s biological paternity and then use this fact to
    compel him to\r\nfinancially support â\x80\x9Chisâ\x80\x9D children.\r\n\r\nIn
    1970s, Laws Said Motherâ\x80\x99s Husband Was Fatherâ\x80\x94Regardless\r\n\r\nHowever,
    when widespread use of donor insemination began in the 1970s,\r\nboth federal
    and state governments in Australia and in other nations\r\nmoved quickly to pass
    legislation that ensured the motherâ\x80\x99s\r\nhusband~~~~not the sperm donor~~~~was
    the legal father of the children.\r\nNevertheless, while governments allowed married
    and later de facto\r\ncouples to use donor sperm to form families, they repeatedly
    denied\r\nlesbians and single women similar access.\r\n\r\nThe reasons are not
    hard to fathom. According to marriage-based\r\ndefinitions of fatherhood, children
    born from donor sperm to single\r\nwomen and lesbians are legally fatherless.
    And while the current\r\nAustralian government has no qualms about men being viewed
    as optional\r\nwhen it comes to raising children~~~~its press releases repeatedly\r\npraise
    the â\x80\x9Cexcellentâ\x80\x9D job done by sole parents~~~~its anxieties about\r\nlegally
    excluding men from the process of forming families are palpable.\r\n\r\nHow do
    men want fatherhood defined? Some men seem eager to endorse\r\nbiological definitions
    of paternity. A U.S. man is currently fighting in\r\nthe courts for relief from
    child support payments to children he\r\nrecently discovered are not his biological
    progeny, although he has been\r\ntheir social father from birth and continued
    to fill this role after his\r\nmarriage broke up.\r\n\r\nOne explanation for declining
    numbers of men willing to donate sperm is\r\nthe possibility that younger men
    believe that siring a child makes a man\r\na father, regardless of his relationship
    to the childâ\x80\x99s mother.\r\n\r\nBut what about the children men help conceive,
    children they donâ\x80\x99t even\r\nknow about? Or the fact that, without testing,
    men cannot be sure the\r\nchildren they love and raise are biologically â\x80\x9Ctheirsâ\x80\x9D?
    The fact that\r\nbiological and social fatherhood can be separated means biological\r\npaternity,
    on its own, will continue to be an inadequate base on which\r\nto ground menâ\x80\x99s
    rights to and responsibilities for children and their\r\nrole in the family.\r\n\r\nEfforts
    to Assert Primacy of Marriage Likely to Fail\r\n\r\nReturning to marriage-based
    definitions of paternity is similarly\r\npointless. The pathetic attempts by the
    Australian government and\r\nâ\x80\x9Cfatherhoodâ\x80\x9D advocates in the United
    States to reassert the primacy of\r\ninstitutions like marriage~~~~and with them
    marriage-based definitions\r\nof fatherhood~~~~are doomed to failure. The economic
    factors that have\r\nhistorically forced women to become and remain married cannot~~~~and\r\nshould
    not~~~~be reinstated in the 21st century.\r\n\r\nThe assumption made by those
    trying to drag us backward are that men are\r\nwilling and eager to marry, have
    children and be responsible husbands\r\nand fathers, but women are rejecting men
    in droves in their eagerness to\r\nremain single and mother alone.\r\n\r\nFish
    may not need bicycles, but anyone who thinks most women donâ\x80\x99t want\r\nto
    live and raise children with men is sorely mistaken. The Womenâ\x80\x99s\r\nHealth
    Study of 39,000 Australian women shows a staggering 96 percent of\r\nyoung women
    aspire to be in a de facto or married partnership, and 92\r\npercent want to be
    mothers by the time they are 35.\r\n\r\nThis suggests that for the vast majority
    of single women, to have a\r\nchild using donor sperm is a decision of last resort.
    As one 37-year-old\r\nwoman in a recent study put it: â\x80\x9COf course, the
    idea would have been to\r\nhave met the man of my dreams and fallen in love and
    have it all happen\r\nthe usual way. â\x80¦ When I was on the (donor insemination)
    program (I\r\nthought), â\x80\x98What a shame Iâ\x80\x99m having to do it this
    way.â\x80\x99 But itâ\x80\x99s the only\r\navenue I have to have a child at this
    point in time.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThe genie of fatherhood let loose by declining
    rates of marriage, rising\r\nnumbers of divorces, extramarital births and the
    radical potential of\r\ndonor insemination wonâ\x80\x99t go back into the bottle.
    We need to search for\r\nnew, flexible definitions of fatherhood suited to the
    future, not the\r\npast. The best place to start is by asking questions about
    what men and\r\nwomen want~~~~from one another and when it comes to children~~~~and
