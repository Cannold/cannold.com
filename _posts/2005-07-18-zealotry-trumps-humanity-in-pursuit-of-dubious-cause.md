    a woman with a foetus diagnosed with dwarfism in 2000. Feeling it has\r\nno choice
    but to defend the principle of patient confidentiality, the\r\nRoyal Womenâ\x80\x99s
    Hospital has decided to seek leave to appeal against the\r\nVictorian magistrateâ\x80\x99s
    ruling at the end of last month. The ruling\r\ncompels the hospital to hand over
    the medical records of the woman known\r\nto the public as Mrs X, despite that
    womenâ\x80\x99s persistent refusal to\r\nconsent to their release.\r\n\r\nThe
    board needs the records to investigate the professional conduct of\r\nthe treating
    doctor. Should they find against him, he could be\r\nsuspended, or lose his registration.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,
    a woman continues to have one of the most private and painful\r\nepisodes of her
    life - one that drove her to the brink of suicide -\r\nsplashed across the pages
    of the newspapers to be discussed and\r\ndissected by strangers.\r\n\r\nThe driver
    behind this tragic state of affairs is anti-choice National\r\nParty Senator Julian
    McGauran. McGauranâ\x80\x99s zealous pursuit of the issue,\r\nfirst through the
    Coronerâ\x80\x99s Court and now the Medical Practitioners\r\nBoard, appears to
    be driven by a number of agendas.\r\n\r\nOne is to raise public awareness of the
    dogâ\x80\x99s breakfast of Victorian\r\nlaws and court judgements that on the
    one hand defines abortion\r\nproviders and aborting women as criminals, but on
    the other enable\r\ndoctors to lawfully provide the procedure if they deem it
    â\x80\x9Cnecessaryâ\x80\x9D to\r\npreserve the womanâ\x80\x99s physical or mental
    health.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the Crimes Act suggest the possibility that even\r\nâ\x80\x9Cnecessaryâ\x80\x9D
    abortions may be illicit if they are done on a viable\r\nfoetus. Such â\x80\x9Cchild
    destructionâ\x80\x9D laws have never been tested in court.\r\nThis means that
    the gestational age at which a foetus is considered to\r\nbe capable of being
    born alive, or the conditions under which a viable\r\nfoetus may be lawfully aborted
    is simply not known. When the motherâ\x80\x99s\r\nlife is at risk? Her physical
    or mental health in peril?\r\n\r\nThe senator may hope that if he succeeds in
    having the Medical\r\nPractitioners Board sanction the doctor who did the abortion,
    he will be\r\none step closer to the anti-choice dream of turning Victoria back
    to a\r\nstate where the legislative view of abortion as a crime prevails over\r\nthe
    judicial understanding of the procedure as a sometimes necessary\r\nhealth intervention.\r\n\r\nIndeed,
    McGauran may already have achieved this end - and more - no\r\nmatter what decision
    the board ultimately makes. Since that fateful day\r\nin 2000, when a kind-hearted
    deeply ethical man with a long history of\r\ncommitment to womenâ\x80\x99s health
    and autonomy decided - in consultation with\r\ncolleagues, including a qualified
    psychiatrist who judged the woman\r\nacutely suicidal - to perform the abortion,
    his life has been hell, his\r\njob threatened, his career in tatters, his ability
    to defend himself\r\nimpeded.\r\n\r\nThere wouldnâ\x80\x99t be an abortion service
    provider in the state, probably\r\nthe country, unaware of his story and the lesson
    it holds for them: toe\r\nwhatever line the anti-choice groups draw in the sand
    or pay the price.\r\nIndeed, since that termination in 2000, an increasingly defensive\r\nmedical
    practice has left many Victorian women stranded at precisely the\r\nmoment when
    they most need support: upon learning their foetus is\r\nstricken with a serious
    or lethal disorder. Having made the difficult\r\ndecision to terminate, many are
    shocked to discover that the hospital\r\nthat offered - may even have urged them
    to have - the ante-natal test\r\nthat revealed the problem, wonâ\x80\x99t extend
    themselves to provide a timely\r\nabortion, or any abortion at all.\r\n\r\nMcGauran
    isnâ\x80\x99t the only one with a case to answer. The State Coroner is\r\nalso
    to blame. Graeme Johnstone gave Mrs Xâ\x80\x99s records to the anti-choice\r\nsenator
    before - seemingly realising his error - sealing them to all\r\nfuture petitioners,
    including the doctors trying to defend themselves\r\nagainst McGauranâ\x80\x99s
    charges. Because one thing is clear. Without those\r\nrecords, the senator would
    never have been able to put the sort of\r\ncomplaint before the Medical Practitioners
    Board that it felt bound to\r\ninvestigate.\r\n\r\nBut this doesnâ\x80\x99t put
    the board in the clear. The Medical Practices Act\r\nmakes clear that the board
    may dismiss complaints it judges to be\r\nâ\x80\x9Cfrivolousâ\x80\x9D or â\x80\x9Cvexatiousâ\x80\x9D,
    as those words are ordinarily understood.\r\nThe Merriam-Websterâ\x80\x99s Dictionary
    of Law defines vexatious as â\x80\x9Clacking a\r\nsufficient ground and serving
    only to annoy or harass when viewed\r\nobjectivelyâ\x80\x9D. Whether or not this
    was his intent, McGuaranâ\x80\x99s\r\ndetermination to see this case investigated,
    first by the coroner and\r\nthen the Medical Practitionerâ\x80\x99s Board, has
    harassed - not to mention\r\ndistressed - not just the aborting woman and her
    doctor, but women and\r\ndoctors who provide abortions more generally.\r\n\r\nIf
    such behaviour doesnâ\x80\x99t qualify as vexatious, I donâ\x80\x99t know what
    does.\r\nItâ\x80\x99s certainly highly unethical. What moral person uses others,\r\nparticularly
    vulnerable others, solely as a means to their own ends?"
