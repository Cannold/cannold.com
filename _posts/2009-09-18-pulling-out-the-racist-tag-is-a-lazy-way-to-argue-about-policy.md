    cry of â\x80\x9Cracismâ\x80\x9D has sounded, and the hounds are off and running.\r\nSince
    last weekâ\x80\x99s outburst by Joe Wilson during President Barack Obamaâ\x80\x99s\r\naddress
    to a joint session of Congress on health care - the congressman\r\ncalled the
    President a â\x80\x9Cliarâ\x80\x9D - the international commentariat has\r\nsought
    to divine the reasons for the remark, and Obamaâ\x80\x99s declining\r\npopularity
    in the polls.\r\n\r\nSome are sure they know the answer. *New York Times* columnist
    Maureen\r\nDowd said that, â\x80\x9Câ\x80¦ fair or not, what I heard was an unspoken
    word in the\r\nair: You lie, boy!â\x80\x9D Adding fuel to the charge of racism
    was former\r\npresident Jimmy Carter, who said that: â\x80\x9CI think that an
    overwhelming\r\nportion of the intensely demonstrated animosity towards â\x80¦
    Obama is based\r\non the fact that he is a black man â\x80¦ the racism inclination
    â\x80¦ bubbled up\r\nâ\x80¦ because of a belief among many white people â\x80¦
    that African Americans\r\nare not qualified to lead this great country.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nWhat
    is wrong with this picture? In my view, the problem is clear. The\r\nwhipping
    up of national and international hysteria about an important\r\nissue on the basis
    of no evidence at all. Motives are elusive, but facts\r\nspeak for themselves.
    Joe Wilson called the President a liar, not boy or\r\nporch monkey or coon or
    jigaboo or any of the depressingly long list of\r\nrace-based insults for black
    Americans.\r\n\r\nWhile heckling a president is unusual (the US Congress is a
    sedate place\r\ncompared with its British and Australian counterparts) neither
    the act\r\nof shouting nor the word Wilson used demonstrates racist sentiment.\r\nSure,
    Wilson may have attacked the President because of the colour of\r\nObamaâ\x80\x99s
    skin (as a South Carolina senator he voted to keep the\r\nConfederate flag flying
    above the state house), or he may have done so\r\nbecause he profoundly disagreed
    with what the President was saying. The\r\nevidence reveals nothing either way.\r\n\r\nFormer
    president Carter is operating in a similar fact-free zone. His\r\ncharge of racism
    seeks to tar not just an individual, but the motives of\r\nmany white Americans.
    â\x80\x9CMost of the animosity white people feel towards\r\nthe President is because
    he is blackâ\x80\x9D and â\x80\x9Cmany white people believe the\r\nPresidentâ\x80\x99s
    skin colour disqualifies him from leading the countryâ\x80\x9D are\r\nstatements
    of fact.\r\n\r\nBut while numerous survey techniques exist to accurately catalogue
    the\r\ndepth and breadth of racist sentiment among Americans - to prove whether\r\nCarterâ\x80\x99s
    assertions are correct - the former president and Nobel Peace\r\nPrize winner
    musters none. Just like columnist Dowd, he seems content to\r\nmake such claims
    on the basis of nothing more solid than his thoughts or\r\nbeliefs.\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s
    not good enough. Average Joe and Josephine have little choice but\r\nto make decisions
    and seek to persuade based on intuition, anecdote and\r\npersonal experience.
    They are not in a position to commission\r\ndouble-blind placebo-controlled trials
    on which washing powder works\r\nbest, or statistically valid polling before they
    opine about what\r\nâ\x80\x9Ceveryoneâ\x80\x9D thinks about this or that. Even
    if they did, they might\r\nstruggle to interpret the results.\r\n\r\nBut opinion
    leaders, like others in positions of responsibility, are\r\ndifferent. What they
    say can critically influence the views of others\r\nand the tone, tenor and direction
    of the political debate. They have a\r\nduty to get it right, not just mouth-off
    to get a rise. This is why\r\nevidence-based policy and medicine are all the rage.
    Surely\r\nevidence-based opinion should be next.\r\n\r\nThe saddest part of the
    current kerfuffle is the damage it could do to\r\nthe Presidentâ\x80\x99s determination
    to eradicate racial inequality in the US.\r\n\r\nAs Obama noted in a recent speech
    to the National Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Coloured People, black Americans
    have a harder road than\r\nwhites. Blacks have borne the brunt of job losses from
    the global\r\nfinancial crisis, are more likely to have poorer health than whites
    and\r\nare five times as likely to end up in jail.\r\n\r\nTackling such inequities
    requires a willingness by the mostly white\r\nâ\x80\x9Chavesâ\x80\x9D to back
    structural change. Given the high levels of support\r\nObama garnered from white
    Americans during the election, there was no\r\nreason to think such support would
    not be forthcoming. But Dowd and\r\nCarterâ\x80\x99s baseless charges of racism
    may have squandered the goodwill\r\nrequired to achieve real change by putting
    whites on the defensive.\r\nFalsely accused and crying victim, they worry aloud
    about being accused\r\nof racism if they raise objections to the Presidentâ\x80\x99s
    policies.\r\n\r\nMotives are elusive but facts speak for themselves. Racial inequity
    in\r\nthe US is real and must be attacked at its root. While the affiliations\r\nand
    funding sources of those critiquing the President must be revealed,\r\nwhere the
    sentiment behind criticism is unknown, it must be taken at\r\nface value. Proof
    only that in a large country with a boisterous\r\ndemocracy, not everyone will
    agree."
