    in conservative,\r\noften religious ideas about how babies ought to be made: by
    married\r\ncouples engaging in \\`\\`naturalâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 acts of intercourse
    that may - God\r\nwilling - result in conception.\r\n\r\nFor religious conservatives,
    the problem with embryo adoption is part\r\nand parcel of the problem with pre-marital
    sex, contraception, and\r\ninfertility treatments such as IVF: the division of
    sex, marriage and\r\nprocreation into separable and interchangeable parts.\r\n\r\nBut
    conservative ideas about family formation and the role of the\r\nAlmighty in human
    generation are not de rigueur for those opposed to\r\nembryo adoption. Embryo
    adoption can, and in my view should, be opposed\r\nbecause of the critical role
    biology plays in our society in creating a\r\nchildâ\x80\x99s sense of who they
    are, where they belong, and why they matter.\r\n\r\nSince the industrial revolution,
    when all rights and responsibilities\r\nfor children - as well as children themselves
    - were placed in the hands\r\nof the nuclear family, biology has played a fundamental
    role in\r\nchildrenâ\x80\x99s understandings of who they are and where they belong.\r\n\r\nWhen
    Margaret Thatcher announced \\`\\`there is no such thing as society,\r\nonly individuals
    and their familiesâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99, she signalled the rise of\r\neconomic rationalism
    as the dominant Western economic and social\r\nparadigm.\r\n\r\nAn economically
    rational society is an itinerant and isolating one that\r\nespouses values that
    are the antithesis of those that bind individuals\r\ntogether. Extended families
    and local communities disintegrate in the\r\nabsence of values such as trust,
    interdependence and responsibility,\r\nforfeiting their historical participation
    in the establishment of\r\nchildrenâ\x80\x99s knowledge of self and place.\r\n\r\nIn
    such individualistic societies, it is largely childrenâ\x80\x99s biological\r\nparents
    who are able to give children a sense of continuity: an\r\nunderstanding of who
    they are in relation to all those who have come\r\nbefore them. It is this social
    fact that partially explains why so many\r\nchildren and adults have found the
    experience of being adopted so\r\ntraumatic.\r\n\r\nRecently, the first children
    born from anonymous sperm donations have\r\nbegun telling similar stories of social
    dislocation and not belonging.\r\nLike those who have been adopted, these young
    people see the search for\r\ntheir biological parent/s as a critical step in discovering
    their\r\n\\`\\`trueâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 identity.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that
    that those adopted or conceived from\r\nanonymous sperm donation feel deprived
    in large part because most of the\r\npeople in the world are raised by their \\`\\`ownâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99
    parents. But this is\r\nprecisely the point. The deprivation suffered by many
    adopted children\r\nand the children of anonymous sperm donors is profoundly social
    in\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nIt is because - and only because - children lack a sense
    of belonging to\r\na community from which they could draw a sense of self and
    place, that\r\nvoluntarily creating more children who will suffer this deprivation\r\nbecomes
    ethically dubious.\r\n\r\nABC-TVâ\x80\x99s Australian Story recently aired a program
    about a young woman\r\nwho has continuing contact with the couple who adopted
    her baby. The\r\nchild knows and loves his biological mother and, as he grows,
    will be\r\ntold the circumstances that led her to relinquish him. By allowing
    the\r\nyoung woman to have an ongoing relationship with her biological child,\r\nsuch
    \\`\\`openâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 adoption procedures may go a long way towards minimising\r\nthe
    distress adoption has caused in the past to both relinquishing\r\nmothers and
    adopted children.\r\n\r\nBut providing ways for the relatively few children placed
    for adoption\r\neach year in Australia to maintain contact with their biological
    parents\r\nis a far cry from deliberately creating such children through the\r\npractice
    of creating and/or adopting embryos. While any child conceived\r\nfrom donated
    eggs or sperm has the right, on their 18th birthday, to\r\nfull identifying information
    about their biological parents, such\r\nlegislation falls far short of adequately
    compensating children for\r\ntheir loss.\r\n\r\nAs numerous adult adoptees reveal,
    it is the non-deliberate nature of\r\ntheir conception that made the loss they
    had suffered as a result of\r\ntheir adoption easier to bear. No one had meant
    any harm. But if the\r\nchild knows they were intentionally conceived in order
    to be\r\n\\`\\`donatedâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99 by the infertility specialist, or donated
    by their\r\nbiological parents to another infertile couple, all bets are off.
    Such\r\nchildren, worries one adult raised by adoptive parents, may wind up\r\nfeeling
    like \\`\\`a commodity, a powerless pawn at the disposalâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 of
    the\r\nspecialist, their biological parents, or both.\r\n\r\nAs my research into
    womenâ\x80\x99s views of abortion showed, all solutions to\r\nan unwanted pregnancy
    - be it abortion, adoption or keeping the baby -\r\ninvolve pain. But unwanted
    pregnancies do happen, and for the few women\r\nwho choose to resolve them by
    opting for adoption, open adoptions seem\r\nthe way to go.\r\n\r\nBut better still
    would be to refuse to conceive and/or \\`\\`donateâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\nthose
    always intended to be raised by their non-biological parents. What\r\npossible
    defence will we give - when such children come knocking on our\r\ndoors in 18
    years time - for failing to do so?"
