  content: "Not long ago I started a conversation thread on Twitter. My hope was that
    some of my more than 5000 followers would engage in some informed speculation
    about what life would be like for working-class people, Aborigines, gays, working
    parents and women of reproductive age if Tony Abbott became prime minister.\r\n\r\nHaving
    begun the conversation by relaying the news that the Opposition Leader was refusing
    to guarantee Labor MP Craig Thomson a pair to attend the birth of his child, I
    kicked off with: ''#WonderifPMAbbott would get rid of paternity leave? Don't dads
    just need to bring home the bacon?''\r\n\r\nSeveral more tweets followed: ''#WonderifPMAbbott
    would support the Gardasil vaccine?'', ''#WonderifPMAbbott would let gay mums
    take maternity leave?'', ''#WonderifPMAbbott will stop women using RU486?''\r\n\r\nMy
    attempt at provocation fell flat. Many seemed to think I was truly wondering about
    the answers to these questions (which they answered as yes, no, no and yes, for
    the record).\r\nAbbott is a well-known quantity. He's jogged the halls of Parliament
    for 17 years, some of these exercising power and judgment in key portfolios such
    as industrial relations and health. He holds strong religious views that â\x80\x93
    and this is the problem â\x80\x93 he has always sought to enshrine in laws that
    govern us all.\r\n\r\nLeopards don't change their spots. However low-profile Abbott
    has sought to keep his conservative views, they will be nailed proudly to the
    mast of any ship he captains once the Liberals take the helm.\r\n\r\nWho can forget
    his description of Aboriginal welcome to country ceremonies as a ''genuflection
    to political correctness''. His relentless use of Parliament to demonise the one-third
    of Australian women who have abortions. ''Every abortion is a tragedy and up to
    100,000 abortions a year is this generation's legacy of unutterable shame,'' he
    told us as he fought tooth and nail to maintain the ban on RU486.\r\n\r\nRemember
    Abbott's boast that the Howard government's decisions to ''overturn the Northern
    Territory's euthanasia law, ban gay marriage, stop the ACT heroin trial, provide
    additional financial support for one-income families and try to reduce abortion
    numbers through pregnancy support counselling,'' showed that the ''eight Catholics
    . . . in the . . . cabinet'' had turned the ''tide of secular humanism''. \r\n\r\nHow
    about his claim that the ''greatest gift'' a woman could give a man was not her
    intelligence, loyalty or soul but her virginity? Who can forget when he called
    homelessness a lifestyle choice?\r\n\r\nWho can forget? The answer, it seems,
    is most of us, suggesting that however much we abhor spin, we're grossly affected
    by it. The Libs hired a ''SheMarketing'' firm to improve Abbott's ''relationship''
    with women and he appears to have followed what must have been the advice: to
    tone down the aggression, stop wearing his religious zeal on his sleeve and give
    deputy Julie Bishop a chance to shine. In the wake of this makeover, we've obligingly
    suffered deep amnesia about who he is and what he's likely to do in government.
    \r\n\r\nWe should seriously think again. Voting for Tony Abbott will deliver a
    man whose Catholic orthodoxy extends to a belief that this orthodoxy is reasonable
    and objectively correct and can fairly be imposed on the rest."
