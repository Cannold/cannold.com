    their sexual rights, themselves a subset of the human rights\r\nguaranteed to
    them in international laws, human rights documents and\r\nother consensus statements.\r\n\r\nBut
    donâ\x80\x99t cry out for joy or fly off the handle with rage just yet.\r\nBecause
    whatever abstract entitlement our kids have to accurate,\r\nrelevant and age-appropriate
    information about sex, relationships and\r\nreproduction in the classroom, most
    arenâ\x80\x99t getting any. Education, that\r\nis. They are getting plenty of
    sex, some of it unwanted, as well as\r\nsexually transmitted infections, unwanted
    pregnancies and, if they are\r\nsame-sex attracted, a worrying dose of suicidal
    thoughts.\r\n\r\nYet, despite such incontrovertible evidence of need, Australia
    lacks a\r\ncomprehensive national sexual and reproductive health strategy. We
    donâ\x80\x99t\r\neven have basic minimum standards for what our kids can be taught.
    Into\r\nthis policy vacuum comes Choices, Decisions, Outcomes, CDO for short,
    an\r\nâ\x80\x9Cinnovative value-based education program for adolescentsâ\x80\x9D
    that\r\nâ\x80\x9Cencourages responsible decision making regarding sexualityâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nCDO
    uses foetal models and flip books to instruct year seven and eight\r\nstudents
    about â\x80\x9Cself worthâ\x80\x9D and self â\x80\x9Crespectâ\x80\x9D. In later
    years, free\r\ngiveaways such as comics and friendship dolls help teach kids that
    peer\r\npressure causes teen sex, which unavoidably results in pregnancy,\r\ninfertility,
    sexually transmitted infections and diseases that kill.\r\n\r\nCDO is the brainchild
    of Jane Power. Janeâ\x80\x99s background is as counsellor\r\nat Pregnancy Help
    Geelong, an approved Right to Life organisation. CDOâ\x80\x99s\r\ncore values
    are â\x80\x9Cto respect human life from conceptionâ\x80\x9D and â\x80\x9Cto\r\nencourage
    saving sexual intimacy until marriage and then only between\r\nhusband and wifeâ\x80\x9D.
    Interestingly, this statement of values is not\r\navailable on CDOâ\x80\x99s website,
    to which students undertaking the course and\r\ntheir parents are directed.\r\n\r\nCDOâ\x80\x99s
    partner organisation, Real Choices Australia, says the program has\r\nbeen delivered
    to more than 100,000 Australian children. Real Choices\r\nAustraliaâ\x80\x99s
    affiliation is not apparent from its website, but it seems\r\nto have links to
    the Catholic Church. Certainly, the funding for CDO is\r\ncoming from somewhere.
    A new education teamâ\x80\x99s kit costs $3000, and their\r\naudio-visual requirements
    another $2000. Thankfully, weâ\x80\x99re all\r\ncontributing to the cause. Donations
    to Real Choices Australia are tax\r\ndeductible.\r\n\r\nOne mother first heard
    about CDO was when her daughter came home from\r\nschool to report that pashing
    makes you pregnant. The girl attends a\r\npublic school in country NSW.\r\n\r\nPro-life,
    abstinence-only sex education crosses the line, pushing\r\nreligion into the secular
    school system where it doesnâ\x80\x99t belong. It can\r\nalso be duplicitous,
    presenting false information about the\r\nâ\x80\x9Cside-effectsâ\x80\x9D of abortion
    and either refusing to talk about\r\ncontraception, or mentioning only (inflated)
    failure rates.\r\n\r\nBut the biggest problem with abstinence-only sex ed is that
    it doesnâ\x80\x99t\r\nwork. A report on the effectiveness of the US Governmentâ\x80\x99s
    significant\r\ninvestment in abstinence-only sex education found that youth delivered\r\nthe
    program had as much sex with as many partners, and started having\r\nsex at the
    same time, as other adolescents.\r\n\r\nWorse, when kids are taught CDO they miss
    out on abstinence-plus\r\napproaches that really work, reducing sexually transmitted
    infections\r\nwithout increasing rates of teenage sex.\r\n\r\nState and federal
    politicians have questions to answer. They need to\r\nexplain why ineffective
    abstinence-only sex education is being taught in\r\npublic classrooms, and why
    they wonâ\x80\x99t put a strategy in place to make\r\nsure our kids get the facts."
