  content: "Historical fiction is a curious genre. In some sense, the pleasures of
    reading historical fiction are similar to those we gain from reading fiction set
    in exotic landscapes. The thrill of seeing men and women living lives in such
    different circumstances to our own. At times, historical fiction can become a
    kind of decorative art: more concerned with the mise en scene of bodices and buckram
    than the exploration of characters and lives, either fictional or non-fictional.
    Not all historical fiction is alike: some works use history as a backdrop, inventing
    characters and stories, like the hugely successful historical works of Sarah Waters
    (Fingersmith, Tipping the Velvet). Others take historical figures as a leaping
    off point, imagining into the gaps in the record, such as Geraldine Brooks (Year
    of Wonders, Calebâ\x80\x99s Crossing), or A S Byatt, whose The Childrenâ\x80\x99s
    Book  is something of a reimagining of the life of childrenâ\x80\x99s author Edith
    Nesbitt. Still others seek to place more or less well-known historical figures
    at the centre of their stories, humanising and particularising their lives while
    aiming to stick, more or less, to the facts. Hilary Mantelâ\x80\x99s Wolf Hall,
    for example, or Philipa Gregoryâ\x80\x99s The Other Boleyn Girl.\r\n\r\nWithin
    these types of works â\x80\x93 or across them â\x80\x93 there are a small sub-genre
    of historical novels that seek to rewrite or reimagine classical Biblical stories.
    Investing them with the rich detail, deep characterisation and interiority that
    the Bible lacks. An even smaller sub-set of these Biblical retellings are revisionist
    â\x80\x93 often feminist â\x80\x93 in their intentions. Focusing on the stories
    of female Biblical characters to enrich, subvert or challenge the patriarchal
    emphasis of the Bible. Perhaps the most well-known of these works is Anita Diamantâ\x80\x99s
    The Red Tent: a wonderfully rich retelling of the story of Jacobâ\x80\x99s wives
    â\x80\x93 Rachel, Leah, Zilpah and Bilhah â\x80\x93 from the perspective of Rachelâ\x80\x99s
    daughter, Dinah. Like Cannoldâ\x80\x99s book, it takes the story of Jacob and
    his wives, and of Dinah, from Genesis as a leaping-off point for an imaginative
    exploration of the lives of women in Biblical times. Rather than being slavishly
    attentive to the story as handed down in the Bible, it focuses on the unwritten,
    unrecorded history of women.\r\n\r\nLike The Red Tent, The Book of Rachel, along
    with being a reimagining of a Biblical story, belongs to that subset of historical
    fiction novels that are politically motivated. Works that seek to imaginatively
    redress the marginalisation of women, people of colour, slaves, children, people
    of the lower classes, the mentally ill and so on in the official - and fictional
    - historical records. Australian author Kate Grenvilleâ\x80\x99s novel Joan Makes
    History is something of an iconic work of this kind, a novelistic equivalent of
    Woolfâ\x80\x99s musings on what may have happened had Shakespeare had a sister.\r\n\r\nNovels
    that seek to make central the historically occluded or erased lives of women are
    an enormous part of this sub-genre of historical fiction. At their best, they
    imaginatively create a more rounded sense of the past, balancing what we know
    with what probably was, foregrounding the tension between what we know and what
    we have failed to record or remember, creatively decentring our comfortable view
    of history . At their worst, they superficially impose the moral, ethical and
    social presumptions of contemporary women onto figures from an earlier time, creating
    awkward figures that are neither of their time nor our own, and who jut out from
    the historical landscape like awkward time-travellers in an otherwise realist
    story.\r\n\r\nCannoldâ\x80\x99s The Book of Rachel is overtly a work of revisionist
    historical fiction: a work in which Cannold imaginatively creates two sisters
    for the Biblical figure of Jesus after seeing a documentary in which it was asserted
    that â\x80\x9CJesus may have had sisters, but no one knew their names.â\x80\x9D
    It also, in a quietly heretical fashion, reimagines some key figures who do figure
    in the Biblical narrative of Christ, most notably Jesus, Mary, Joseph and Judas.
    Each of these figures are slightly renamed in the novel (Joshua, Miriame, Yosef
    and Judah), perhaps to move them a step away from their mythical, perhaps historical,
    counterparts, though the basic structure of their relationships are maintained,
    and key events in the players' lives are recognise, though each event is seen
    through far more of a realist lens. There are no virgin births, resurrections,
    or miracles of loaves and fishes, instead the events of Joshuaâ\x80\x99s life
    are rewritten as non-magical events, albeit with enormous political and social
    impact.\r\n\r\nThe story is narrated by Joshuaâ\x80\x99s sister, Rachael, in a
    brisk, engaging and modern voice. The style is easy to read, racing along through
    a story filled with drama, romance and intrigue. While the writing is spare, Cannold
    is deft at evoking the dry, humble landscape of her characterâ\x80\x99s lives,
    bringing a fresh but spare beauty to her tale. She is also adept at creating characters
    that live and breathe. Some of this is, as with the main character, Rachael, at
    the expense of historical realism: the characters talk and think in modern language
    and terms. This isnâ\x80\x99t so much a weakness as a choice: one that makes the
    characters feel more like hybrids of modern and historical  folk than people of
    their time, and which perhaps makes them easier for a modern reader to empathise
    with, and to understand. Rachaelâ\x80\x99s relationship with Judah, for example,
    proceeds according to fairly familiar romantic tropes for modern readers, in which
    her emotional and physical attraction to him are foregrounded. In the scene where
    they first walk alone together, for example, their awkwardness is underscored
    by a sexual yearning that finds partial expression in her appreciation for the
    beauty of the landscape:\r\n\r\nI found it hard even to meet his gaze. In reply
    to my shyness, Judahâ\x80\x99s eyes trailed me like I was royalty; or so fragile,
    perhaps, that I might break. It was spring, and the climate was a cradle, the
    outside air a perfect match for the heat in our blood. The trail was a narrow
    bridal walk, strewn with the seasonâ\x80\x99s flowers: cyclamen of every shade
    and explosions of white hyacinth. Strangers trudged past from the opposite direction.
    Assyrians and Phoenicians, their eyes downcast, backs and beasts burdened with
    sacramental wares for the Temple market in Jerusalem. We neither greeted them
    nor spoke to each other. So long did the stilted silence between us prevail that
    the skin beneath my arms and woven belt began weeping with uneasy sweat.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    Judah cleared his throat. â\x80\x98Rachel,â\x80\x99 he began, his voice cracking.
    I turned as if admiring a rolling hill of wildflowers to hide my smile. He was
    nervous, too. (122)\r\n\r\nWhile many of the key events of the Biblical story
    of Jesus inform the plot, it is largely the story of womenâ\x80\x99s lives. Not
    just Rachael, whose intelligence and independence are typical of the proto-feminist
    protagonists of feminist/revisionist historical fiction, but also her bitter and
    difficult mother, Miriame, the healer-crone, Bindy, and Rachaelâ\x80\x99s sister,
    Shona. \r\n\r\nIn some ways, Rachael is a deeply anachronistic character. It is
    difficult to believe that a woman of her time, place, and class would so easily
    embrace the principles of equality and independence that a modern Australian woman
    takes for granted. And yet, if, as a reader, youâ\x80\x99re prepared to put aside
    the question of how or why she is the way she is, the novel is an engaging and
    imaginative story about how such a woman might make her way in the ancient world
    of Galilee. In this sense, the novel is deeply speculative: a â\x80\x98what ifâ\x80\x99
    novel that considers almost overtly the conflict between historical and contemporary
    notions of gender, identity and class.\r\n\r\nIn some ways, like most works of
    historical fiction, it is in the end most concerned not with the past, but with
    the present. Or, perhaps more accurately, with the ongoing negotiations between
    the past and the present. The novel, like many of its kind, invites us to consider
    what has changed, what we have learned, what we have failed to learn. If the bare
    facts of Rachaelâ\x80\x99s life, and the lives of the other women in the novel,
    are deeply scarred by the patriarchal culture in which they live, they are scarred
    in ways that are still recognisable. In many parts of the world, including the
    so-called First World, women still struggle for equality and true independence.
    Womenâ\x80\x99s sexual, financial and social independence is still constricted
    by moral, ethical, religious and legal systems that have evolved from systems
    such as those that govern Rachaelâ\x80\x99s life.\r\n\r\nThis is an engaging and
    easy-to-read book. Though, clearly, it may not be suitable for those whose personal
    beliefs are at odds with its pragmatic and feminist reimagining of the Biblical
    story, it is a fascinating attempt to recreate ancient Galilee and imagine what
    it might have been like for a woman with more modern sensibilities to live there.\r\n"

  what we have learned, what we have failed to learn. If the bare facts of Rachaelâ\x80\x99s
  life, and the lives of the other women in the novel, are deeply scarred by the patriarchal
  culture in which they live, they are scarred in ways that are still recognisable.
  In many parts of the world, including the so-called First World, women still struggle
  for equality and true independence. Womenâ\x80\x99s sexual, financial and social
  independence is still constricted by moral, ethical, religious and legal systems
  that have evolved from systems such as those that govern Rachaelâ\x80\x99s life.\r\n\r\nThis
  is an engaging and easy-to-read book. Though, clearly, it may not be suitable for
  those whose personal beliefs are at odds with its pragmatic and feminist reimagining
  of the Biblical story, it is a fascinating attempt to recreate ancient Galilee and
  imagine what it might have been like for a woman with more modern sensibilities
  to live there.\r\n"
