    crave. Ways that allow us to find and to nurture it, so as we\r\njourney through
    life - with the same lover or someone different - it\r\nwill continue to flourish.\r\n\r\nExcuses
    for this vary, but some put it down to loveâ\x80\x99s furry edge. Love\r\nis the
    â\x80\x9Cejectionâ\x80\x9D of irrational emotion, so beyond the grasp of reason.\r\nIndeed,
    many philosophers believe this to be true of all emotions, which\r\nthey see as
    irrelevant, even hostile, to morality.\r\n\r\nI say rubbish. Intimate partnerships
    run in seven-year cycles. Those\r\nwith the wisdom to choose the right person,
    then make the relationship\r\nanew every few years, are a repository of considered
    good sense, not to\r\nmention the happiest and most compassionate folk around.
    Hereâ\x80\x99s what\r\nIâ\x80\x99ve learned from some of them.\r\n\r\n\\_One person
    can never meet all your needs (and this means sex, too)\\_\r\n\r\nEvery relationship
    will leave you wanting somewhere. When applied to\r\nfriends, this often goes
    without notice. So Marla loves bad music, and\r\nAndrew hates cats. Thatâ\x80\x99s
    them, and thatâ\x80\x99s life. But when lovers\r\ndisappoint us, we can grow bitter.
    Even depressed. Theyâ\x80\x99re supposed to\r\nbe our everything! But they canâ\x80\x99t
    be. No one can.\r\n\r\nIt is the exclusivity of intimate partnerships in Anglo
    countries (the\r\nFrench do it differently) that torpedoes loving partnerships
    that might\r\notherwise survive. If what our partner wasnâ\x80\x99t could be treated
    with\r\nequanimity rather than as a threat - because we were free to get those\r\nneeds
    met elsewhere - why would we leave, or sneak behind their backs?\r\nWe donâ\x80\x99t
    do either to our friends.\r\n\r\n*Loving others means loving yourself*\r\n\r\nOh,
    I know it sounds like a fairy bumper sticker, but if you understood\r\nthe first
    point, youâ\x80\x99ll know that itâ\x80\x99s true.\r\n\r\nComing to terms with
    what your partner lacks is one thing. Having to\r\naccept the same about yourself
    - that you cannot give him everything -\r\nis something else again. To do it requires
    considerable resilience and\r\nself-esteem. The sort of bullet-proof self-love
    that means you donâ\x80\x99t\r\ntake her preference to holiday with friends as
    evidence youâ\x80\x99re no fun to\r\nbe with, or that he no longer desires you
    as proof that youâ\x80\x99re rank.\r\n\r\nThis is challenging stuff, and not for
    the faint-hearted. No wonder so\r\nmany cling to the traditional â\x80\x99til-death-do-us-part.
    But if we really\r\nlove ourselves and love the other, we want for them what they
    seek for\r\nthemselves, glorying like a mother in their joy and pleasure, even
    when\r\nsomeone else caused it, and we werenâ\x80\x99t there to see it. We wish
    them to\r\nhave what want in this world even if, for a time, itâ\x80\x99s someone
    else.\r\n\r\n*If you love someone, set them free*\r\n\r\nWisdom, or the dubious
    advice of a seagull? Whatever the case, to me it\r\nmakes sense. Because if lasting
    love canâ\x80\x99t be jealous or exclusive, then\r\nit must be chosen, and chosen
    again. I love you because you make my\r\nheart beat faster; I love you because
    of how you make me feel about\r\nmyself. I love you because youâ\x80\x99re the
    sort of person I want to parent my\r\nchildren. I love you because I respect and
    trust you. After all weâ\x80\x99ve\r\nseen and done together, youâ\x80\x99ve never
    let me down.\r\n\r\nNo one is everything. Love yourself, and seek for those you
    love what\r\nthey seek for themselves. Set your beloved free, and perhaps heâ\x80\x99ll
    soon\r\ncome back."
