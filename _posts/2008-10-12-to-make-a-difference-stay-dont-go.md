    Better then a day at the races to watch, and to be the one\r\nresigning! I feel
    giddy just thinking about it.\r\n\r\nSo my attention was snagged when the high-profile
    resignations of the\r\nchief executive of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra Trevor
    Green and one\r\nof the nationâ\x80\x99s most senior diplomats Ian Wilcock resigned
    from the\r\nAthenaeum club in Melbourne earlier this year. The Athenaeum is one
    of a\r\nnumber of exclusive associations that invites membership from prominent\r\nprofessionals
    and community leaders of intelligence and good character,\r\nas long as they are
    men.\r\n\r\nThe clubâ\x80\x99s ongoing refusal to consider membership applications
    from\r\nwomen was unacceptable to both Green and Wilcock. â\x80\x9CI cannot fully\r\nexpress
    how disappointed I am with the outcome of the decision not to\r\nmake the club
    available to female membership,â\x80\x9D Green wrote when he hung\r\nup his towel.
    Said Wilcock: â\x80\x9CI do not wish to spend any more time\r\npretending to respect
    the sensitivities ofâ\x80¦men whoâ\x80¦want to retreat to\r\nsome kind of boysâ\x80\x99
    treehouse where they might be untroubled by half the\r\nhuman race.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nLet
    me state one thing very clearly: I see Green and Wilcock as highly\r\nethical
    men. Their willingness to stick their head above the parapet for\r\nthe opposite
    sex, bucking the Athenaeumâ\x80\x99s 140-year tradition and the\r\nat-times underhanded
    tactics of the clubâ\x80\x99s anti-women leadership, is\r\nmore than worthy of
    praise.\r\n\r\nBut even more praise-worthy are the men who are so desperate to,
    as\r\nWilcock put it â\x80\x9Ccoax the club in to the 1970sâ\x80\x9D that they
    havenâ\x80\x99t\r\nresigned. Instead, theyâ\x80\x99ve stayed on to re-group and
    continue the fight.\r\n\r\nI feel sure that, having fought so hard for the club
    to open their doors\r\nto women, upstanding men like Former Victorian Liberal
    Party state\r\ndirector John Ridley, Graeme Samuel, Eddie McGuire, Terry Moran,
    Jack\r\nSmorgon, former Hawthorn president Ian Dicker and former federal health\r\nminister
    Michael Wooldridge would have been bitterly disappointed when\r\nthe vote was
    lost. But despite being told in unequivocal terms to pull\r\ntheir heads in, these
    men have battled on.\r\n\r\nA resignation, even a high-profile one, is a splash
    in the pan. A day at\r\nmost of media sizzle-a piece in the back pages of the
    \\\r\nnewspaper and then, gone. Not enough exposure of the issue to get the\r\npublic
    so hopping mad they start barracking for change and when all the\r\nfizz and sparkle
    dies away, the same old organization is still standing,\r\nbut now minus one of
    the brave and principled members who could have\r\nforced a change.\r\n\r\nThis
    is the problem with leaving-you are gone. However, noble the\r\nintentions, resignations
    designed to draw attention to an injustice can,\r\nnumbers being what they are,
    perpetuate it.\r\n\r\nThis is essentially what has happened to Australiaâ\x80\x99s
    Christian\r\ncommunities. Progressive Christians, unable to cope with the turning\r\naway
    of the Church from achieving social and environmental justice and\r\nworld peace,
    have deserted in droves. The consequence? A volcanic\r\nexpansion of the influence
    of those who remain and, as a consequence, a\r\nChurch even more focused on personal
    moral issues like abortion.\r\n\r\nSometimes there is no choice. Sometimes the
    rot in Denmark is so deep\r\nand pervasive that the only solution is to flee the
    state. But\r\nsometimes, no matter how satisfying a good resignation can be, a
    real\r\ndifference can only be made if you stay, not go."
