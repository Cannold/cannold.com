    in February last year when St Kilda AFL player Sam Gilbert and\r\nother players
    attended a school clinic in Melbourne where they met a\r\n16-year-old student.
    A month later, in another city while competing in\r\nan athletics competition,
    the girl hooked up with the players at a\r\nhotel. She had sex with one player
    and soon became Gilbertâ\x80\x99s girlfriend.\r\n\r\nIn May the teen told her
    school principal that she was pregnant with\r\ntwins by Gilbert. He reported it
    but by the end of the month both the\r\nAFL and police investigations concluded
    that no inappropriate or illegal\r\nactivity occurred.\r\n\r\nIn September the
    teen began meeting agent Ricky Nixon at his office.\r\nAbout this time the girl
    began spruiking the nude photos of St Kilda\r\nplayers but, finding no takers,
    uploaded the images to Facebook. Gilbert\r\nlaunched a lawsuit and St Kilda vice-president
    Ross Levin vowed to make\r\nher pay.\r\n\r\nAfter a text message correspondence
    Nixon visited the teen in a city\r\nhotel. She alleged drug-taking and an affair.
    A QC investigation was\r\nbegun but the findings were pre-empted by Nixonâ\x80\x99s
    admission of a\r\nsubstance abuse problem and his recent decision to step down.\r\n\r\nSome
    good-hearted commentators have been worrying about the girl, who\r\nthey see as
    a vulnerable child unable to make informed and voluntary\r\nchoices. They assume
    her actions to date have been mistakes and express\r\ndread about â\x80\x9Cpermanent
    consequencesâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nPart of their worry is the intersection of the age-old
    tale of\r\nboy-humiliates-girl, girl-goes-for-jugular, with new media platforms\r\nthat
    reveal, amplify and archive every indiscretion. I worry, too, but\r\nalso wonder
    whether based on the evidence to date, might we be\r\ncatastrophising a bit? Could
    sexist ideas about reputation and\r\nrisk-taking be clouding our judgment?\r\n\r\nThe
    teen does appear to have been victimized by several men in positions\r\nof authority,
    but sheâ\x80\x99s also claimed some scalps. While vengeance is\r\nnever edifying,
    it occupies a prominent place in the moral landscape of\r\nmost teens, offering
    a means to overcome humiliation and save face. On a\r\nscorecard of her own making,
    sheâ\x80\x99s arguably one up.\r\n\r\nYes, this girl is taking risks - lots of
    them. Worse, sheâ\x80\x99s doing it in\r\na world changing so fast that the full
    dimensions of a worst-case\r\noutcome canâ\x80\x99t really be fully assessed.\r\n\r\nBut
    teens have always been risk-takers and society always less forgiving\r\nof the
    risks young women tend to take (often with sex, risking unwanted\r\npregnancy,
    sexual assault) compared with those taken by young men\r\n(drinking too much,
    driving too fast).\r\n\r\nInterestingly, just as more young women embrace â\x80\x9Cmaleâ\x80\x9D
    risks, social\r\ntolerance for such risk-taking is declining. Thatâ\x80\x99s OK,
    but we need to\r\nbe gender-equitable in our opprobrium, and realistic about the
    capacity\r\nof the adolescent brain to make the assessments fundamental to prudent\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\nThis
    is the precise point of the worriers. But the truth is that the law\r\ndeems most
    seventeen year olds competent to authorize their own medical\r\ntreatment because
    they have the ability to understand that there is a\r\nchoice, and that all choices
    have consequences. From that we might\r\nconclude sheâ\x80\x99s like mature enough
    to make choices and wear\r\nresponsibility for them in other areas of life, too.\r\n\r\nThe
    St Kilda teen has flown the nest. I wish her the best."
