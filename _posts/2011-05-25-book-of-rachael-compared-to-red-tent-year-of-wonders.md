    And the verdict is well good. \r\n\r\n\r\nHave you found Jesus? The publishing
    industry certainly has, and theyâ\x80\x99re not letting him go. Why would they,
    when heâ\x80\x99s responsible for so many sales? Thereâ\x80\x99s that perennial
    best-seller, the Holy Bible, for a start, for which Jesus can take at least half
    the credit. Thereâ\x80\x99s the multitudinous scholarly texts and mediations on
    his legacy; thereâ\x80\x99s all those prayer books and hymnals that have been
    churned out since medieval times. And then, more recently, there is the fiction.
    I sometimes wonder if we have CS Lewis to blame for this, if he set the ball rolling
    with â\x80\x9CThe Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe,â\x80\x9D an allegory of Christâ\x80\x99s
    crucifixion, with Aslan the majestic lion sacrificing himself for Edmund the sinner.
    In the past fifty years there have been a slew of novels reimagining the life
    of the carpenterâ\x80\x99s son from Galilee who claimed he was the son of Godâ\x80¦
    â\x80\x9CThe Last Temptation of Christâ\x80\x9D, which became, of course, the
    last movie that anyone ever liked Mel Gibson in; â\x80\x9CKing Jesusâ\x80\x9D,
    by Robert Graves, bestselling author of â\x80\x9CI, Claudiusâ\x80\x9D; my personal
    favourite, Norman Mailerâ\x80\x99s predictably earthy and libidinous Christ in
    â\x80\x9CThe Gospel According to the Sonâ\x80\x9D; and then, in the last twenty-four
    months alone, an unholy trinity- â\x80\x9CChrist The Lordâ\x80\x9D by vampire
    doyenne Anne Rice, â\x80\x9CThe Good Man Jesus and The Scoundrel Christ,â\x80\x9D
    by the award-winning and much loved Phillip Pullman, and â\x80\x9CThe Final Testament
    of the Holy Bibleâ\x80\x9D by James Frey, who likes to make up stuff.\r\n\r\nAll
    of which is why I found Leslie Cannoldâ\x80\x99s first novel, The Book of Rachael,
    so refreshing. Cannold approaches the time-worn tale of the life and death of
    Jesus Christ from a new and intriguing perspective- that of Jesusâ\x80\x99s sister,
    Rachael, who falls in love with his best friend and eventual betrayer, Judas Iscariot.
    As she notes in a post-script to the book, Cannold was inspired to imagine Rachaelâ\x80\x99s
    life after watching a BBC documentary where the names, fates and even burial places
    of Jesusâ\x80\x99s brothers were itemized, but- as the narrator casually announced-
    nothing had been recorded concerning his sisters. That those sisters existed is
    confirmed by the bible in the gospel of Mark, yet the status of women at that
    time was far too lowly for any further details of their life to have been set
    down. The challenge to ethicist and social activist Cannold must have been irresistible.
    In The Book of Rachael she sets out to correct the balance.\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s
    an intriguing premise, and one on which Cannold delivers. Rachael is a fiery,
    rebellious but hugely likeable character. A natural mimic, she learns to write
    the alphabet (an activity forbidden to females) after only one lesson; she apprentices
    herself to the blind crone, Bindy, and becomes a skilled midwife and healer. Even
    more intriguing however, at least for this reader, is what Cannold does with the
    story of Jesus. Cannoldâ\x80\x99s Jesus (here called Joshua) is the seed of an
    illegitimate rather than immaculate conception; a good- but very human- man, one
    who serves his father and his Lord, but also falls in love and commits the sin
    of premarital sex. When his pregnant lover, Maryam of Magdalene, is taken away
    in shame by her father Joshua immediately leaves their town of Nazareth and searches
    for her throughout Galilee, along the way cursing the priests and the law-makers
    who would have her stoned for sinning. He quickly accumulates a following of outcasts
    and disciples, who travel with him to Jerusalem, where Maryam is eventually found.\r\n\r\nThe
    Joshua of the early sections of the book is clear-headed and compassionate, a
    reasoned and rational philosopher respected by both Judas (here named Judah) and
    Rachael. As the novel nears its climax, however, his thinking becomes more and
    more deluded, then dangerous, until Judah is left with what he sees as only one
    course of action to prevent them all from being killed. That the reader feels,
    in the end, more sympathy for Judah than for Joshua is not the only unorthodox
    twist in the tale. An avowed atheist, Cannold cleverly plays with many of the
    central events of the gospels- the raising of Lazarus, the over-turning of the
    moneylenders in the temple, the triumphant entry into Jerusalem- reimagining them
    from a secular point of view. (Spoiler alert) Tellingly, though the crucifixion
    scene is almost unbearably moving, there is no resurrection. Many of Cannoldâ\x80\x99s
    characters may recognise Joshua as the messiah, but she herself does not- a dichotomy
    which keeps the book absorbing and engaging to the end.\r\n\r\nAs, too, does the
    character of Rachael, who we first meet aged five and leave in her thirties. Though
    Joshua and Judah both weaken and waver at times as the story unfolds, Rachael
    does not. She remains constant- headstrong, compassionate, both cursed and saved
    by her fierce intelligence. Cannold has clearly researched the era thoroughly,
    and brings it vividly to life: the sights, the smells, the stranglehold of both
    the Romans and the law. In subject matter and setting, The Book of Rachael reminded
    me strongly of Anita Diamantâ\x80\x99s bestseller The Red Tent; in tone I found
    it reminiscent of Geraldine Brooksâ\x80\x99 Year of Wonders. Despite this, it
    is truly original; a unique and appealing take on one of the oldest stories in
    the book.\r\n"
