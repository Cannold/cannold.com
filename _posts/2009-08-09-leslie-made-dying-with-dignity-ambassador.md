We as Ambassadors for law reform say:

"For decades the majority of Australians have believed that those who are suffering intolerably from a terminal or advanced stage of an incurable illness should have the legal right to request and obtain medical assistance to end their lives with dignity. Today, 85% of Australians believe it should be a fundamental right. A responsible Act of Parliament will enable that right, with safeguards."

We say to the Parliament, Letâ€™s Get on with it. Legislation lags behind the will of the people. Bring this issue to a conscience vote and demonstrate that this is an enlightened society."
