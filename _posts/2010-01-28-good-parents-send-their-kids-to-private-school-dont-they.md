    Choose a Good Time over Kids Education.â\x80\x9D It had the same\r\nflavour as
    the bankâ\x80\x99s offering when it released similar market research\r\nlast year.
    â\x80\x9CAussie families prefer holidays and Botox to private school\r\neducation.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nYes,
    the Bankwest â\x80\x9CSocial Indicator Seriesâ\x80\x9D is back, demonstrating
    once\r\nagain that some Australian parents wonâ\x80\x99t forgo dining out, yoga
    classes,\r\nmovies or holidays to pay fees for a non-government school.\r\n\r\nNot
    only are parents who donâ\x80\x99t sacrifice to send their kids to private\r\nschool
    vacuous and selfish, theyâ\x80\x99re stupid, too. As the press release\r\nmakes
    clear, parent satisfaction with private schools is on the\r\nincrease, while those
    who send their kids to public school are\r\nincreasingly downcast.\r\n\r\nBankwestâ\x80\x99s
    spokesman, Adrian Bradley, explains the problem clearly.\r\nParents just â\x80\x9Carenâ\x80\x99t
    prepared to budge on lifestyle [despite] the widely\r\nheld perception that parents
    will sacrifice nearly anything in the\r\ninterests of their kidsâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nAre
    those who sacrifice house renovations, family holidays, pools,\r\ndinner, yoga
    classes or movies to pay for private school good parents,\r\nwhile those who refuse
    to give up such â\x80\x9Cluxuriesâ\x80\x9D bad?\r\n\r\nBankwest thinks so, for
    its own self-interested reasons. Parents who\r\nrefuse to sweat about their incapacity
    to pay close to $15,000 per year\r\nper darling to send their children to non-government
    schools are\r\ndecidedly uninterested in the savings products the bank sells.
    An\r\nabsence of parental anxiety about â\x80\x9Cplanning aheadâ\x80\x9D to secure
    their\r\nchildrenâ\x80\x99s educational future is bad for business.\r\n\r\nBut
    back in the real world, who the good and bad parents are is less\r\nclear. If
    I hadnâ\x80\x99t done yoga when I had two children under two, I would\r\nhave
    been a snarling, raving, stressed-out mess. I still remember my now\r\n13-year-old
    looking up at me as we marched off the beach on the last day\r\nof a long-ago
    family holiday. He was two. â\x80\x9CCan we come here always?â\x80\x9D he\r\nasked,
    and I knew what he meant.\r\n\r\nCan we come to this place where you and Daddy
    are always around and no\r\none is rushing off to work or taking me to creche
    or cramming me into a\r\ntrolley so we can do the supermarket shopping? Can we
    come to this place\r\nwhere everyone isnâ\x80\x99t busy and weâ\x80\x99re together
    all the time? Call it a\r\nluxury, but our yearly family holiday is the glue that
    holds my clan\r\ntogether. Sacrifice it to cover less than half the fees for one
    child to\r\nattend private school? Not on your nelly.\r\n\r\nA house with a pool
    is a drawcard for the sort of informal neighbourhood\r\ngatherings that build
    community. Experts advise parents to take time\r\neach week to have dinner or
    spend time together without the kids if they\r\nwant to save their marriage. Renovating
    oneâ\x80\x99s house could mean the\r\naddition of a flat so the kids can spend
    more time with grandma, or an\r\nopen-plan kitchen that allows parents to cook
    while yakking to the kids.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing wrong with Australians arguing
    passionately and loudly\r\nabout what makes a good parent. Parenting matters and,
    for many of us,\r\nraising our corner of the next generation is the most important
    job\r\nweâ\x80\x99ll ever have. It is both right and human that we would look
    for rules\r\nand examples to follow, and strive to measure up.\r\n\r\nThe problem
    is that while old ideals of good motherhood and fatherhood\r\nhave been discredited,
    new standards have yet to evolve. Most mothers\r\nunder 40 would likely reject
    the 1950s view that a good mother does not\r\nwork outside the home, but disagree
    about the right mix of paid and\r\nhome-based work a good mother should undertake.
    Modern men, too, are\r\nclear they want to be different to their own fathers,
    more involved and\r\nless consumed by the demands of earning, but are also unsure
    how to get\r\nthe balance right.\r\n\r\nUncertainty about what a good parent is
    makes us vulnerable to anxiety\r\nand guilt about getting it wrong. The Bankwest
    survey is an attempt to\r\nleverage those emotions to serve the bankâ\x80\x99s
    bottom line. It follows a\r\nlong and unfortunate Australian tradition of using
    the public/private\r\nschool issue as a proxy for debate about who is and isnâ\x80\x99t
    a good parent.\r\n\r\nA diverse community will have diverse values about what
    makes a good\r\nparent. Where liberty is prized, and people of different backgrounds\r\nlive
    side-by-side, good parenting standards may not be ideals to which\r\nwe all aspire,
    but minimum standards of â\x80\x9Cgood enoughâ\x80\x9D parenting below\r\nwhich
    no one ought fall.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of parents to defer their own needs to
    meet their childâ\x80\x99s\r\nis one such bottom line, though parents will disagree
    about which needs\r\nare most important.\r\n\r\nI sacrificed for my children,
    but only to give them what I thought\r\nreally mattered. A calm and healthy mother,
    married parents and shared\r\nmemories of happy times together were what I saw
    as essential to their\r\nfuture happiness and success.\r\n\r\nSaving, borrowing
    or spending up to half our income to pay for private\r\nschool was never on the
    agenda."
