    â\x80\x93 is being forced to have a blood transfusion, after the NSW Supreme Court
    ruled that the teenager must undergo the potentially lifesaving procedure.\r\n\r\nThe
    patient is suffering from Hodgkinâ\x80\x99s lymphoma â\x80\x93 a lethal form of
    blood cancer â\x80\x93 but has threatened to rip an IV needle out of his own arm,
    if a blood transfusion is attempted.\r\n\r\nJehovahâ\x80\x99s Witnesses believe
    that the Bible prohibits the â\x80\x98ingestingâ\x80\x99 of blood â\x80\x93 or
    even components of blood such as platelets and plasma â\x80\x93 and therefore
    do not believe that Christians should accept blood transfusions.\r\n\r\nEven in
    emergencies. Even when it is literally a matter if life or death.\r\n\r\nTeenager
    X told Professor Glenn Marshall â\x80\x93 his doctor at the Sydney Childrenâ\x80\x99s
    Hospital â\x80\x93 that if he were put under aneasthesia in order to be given
    a blood transfusion â\x80\x93 it would be akin to â\x80\x98rapeâ\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nWhen
    handing down his ruling that the teenager will be forced to accept the blood transfusion,
    Supreme Court Justice Ian Gzell said that the young patient had been â\x80\x9Dcocooned
    in faithâ\x80\x9D throughout his life.\r\n\r\nWhile doctors had tried to respect
    the young patientâ\x80\x99s wishes for as long as possible, his case became more
    and more serious. Now? Treatment is the only thing that will save them.\r\n\r\nWhen
    X was first admitted into hospital in January of 2012, he underwent seven months
    of chemotherapy. X initially went into remission but then Professor Marshall discovered
    cancer in his lungs, spleen and lymph nodes.\r\n\r\nBecause a higher dose of chemotherapy
    was likely to require a blood transfusion, X underwent two cycles of a lower dose
    â\x80\x93 but his tumors were barely reduced.\r\n\r\nIn March this year, X developed
    severe anaemia and his chemotherapy treatments had to be stopped altogether. Still,
    the patient refused any further treatments that could result in a blood transfusion
    being necessary.\r\n\r\nAnd then the doctors took the case to court.\r\n\r\nFairfax
    reported:\r\n\r\nProfessor Marshall, who has 20 yearsâ\x80\x99 experience treating
    children with cancer, told the Court X had an 80 per cent chance of dying from
    anaemia without a blood transfusion.\r\n\r\nIf he was allowed to administer his
    preferred treatment, he said X would have up to a 50 per cent chance of survival.
    Apart from ripping out the IV if he could, X and his father would otherwise obey
    the court order, Judge Gzell found.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9DThe sanctity of life in the
    end is a more powerful reason for me to make the orders than is respect for the
    dignity of the individual,â\x80\x9D Justice Gzell said in his ruling. â\x80\x9DX
    is still a child, although a mature child of high intelligence.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nWhat
    makes this case different from so many before it is that the courtâ\x80\x99s ruling
    was handed down only 10 months before the patient is set to turn 18. As soon as
    the teenager is legally considered an adult, his wishes to refuse a transfusion
    would have to be respected.\r\n\r\nPrecious cases where the facts have been analogous,
    have always involved young children, whose parents have forbidden doctors to use
    blood transfusions. This time itâ\x80\x99s different.\r\n\r\n\r\n.\r\nMamamia
    spoke to ethicist Leslie Cannold, she points out that although most mainstream
    media have taken the perspective of X â\x80\x98being only 10 months away from
    turning 18â\x80\x99, it is equally possible to say that he is â\x80\x98only two
    months over 17â\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nCannold says that â\x80\x9Cfrom an ethical point
    of view, I would definitely agree that we need to support people making decisions
    that are consistent with their own beliefs and values â\x80\x93 even when we as
    a society may disagree with those beliefs and values.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CBut when
    we are talking about someone who is not generally considered to be competent [such
    as a teenager], I think itâ\x80\x99s really important to err on the side of caution
    and give that person as much time as possible to get to an age where we have to
    concede that they know their own mind.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CAnd that they are not,
    for instance, being so constrained in religion â\x80¦ that they havenâ\x80\x99t
    had a chance to develop those kinds of independent thought processes, that we
    generally tend to associate with people making independent, autonomous choices.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CWhen
    youâ\x80\x99re in a sect that is so isolated from mainstream society, â\x80\x9C
    Leslie says, â\x80\x9Cyour entire social and emotional life is caught up in being
    a part of this sect, and the cost of refusing to follow the edict means you will
    be shunnedâ\x80¦ Generally as a society we donâ\x80\x99t believe that people should
    have to chose between their lives, and membership of a religious group.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nBut
    in cases such as these? Jehovahâ\x80\x99s witnesses do make such a choice.\r\n\r\nLeslie
    continues, â\x80\x9CI am very uncomfortable about that. I think that itâ\x80\x99s
    worrying, and thatâ\x80\x99s why I agree that people should have as much time
    as possible â\x80\x93 17 years, 11 months, and 29 days â\x80\x93 to get the chance
    to possibly get some sort of chronological maturity, or some sort of external
    input that might come their way, that might lead them to believe that they can
    choose to save their life, and that that is viable choice for them to make.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIn
    the case of X, Leslie says that she â\x80\x9C[worries] that for this particular
    boy, it might not seem like an option. And you canâ\x80\x99t really make a choice,
    when you donâ\x80\x99t have a rage of options. The definition of choice becomes
    meaningless, really.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThe fact remains that if Xâ\x80\x99s life
    is extended for 10 months â\x80\x93 he will then be legally allowed to refuse
    a blood transfusion from his doctors at that stage. And his condition is such
    that several transfusions will be needed for him to survive.\r\n\r\nDoctors have
    won the right to extend this patientâ\x80\x99s life for 10 months.\r\n\r\nBut
    not for any longer."
