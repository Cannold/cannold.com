    What do frozen eggs and ovaries, donor eggs, and hormone\r\nreplacement therapy
    have in common?\r\n\r\nAnswer: They have all helped women overcome age-related
    infertility or\r\nâ\x80\x9Cbeatâ\x80\x9D their biological clocks - or may be used
    to do so in the future.\r\n\r\nJulian Savulescu, the director of the Murdoch Instituteâ\x80\x99s
    ethics unit,\r\ncontends that despite the risks to women of the drugs used in
    many\r\ninfertility treatments, fertile women have a right of access to\r\nreproductive
    advances such as egg freezing. In giving women the same\r\nchoices as men - to
    be educated, to work and to have children at the\r\ntime of their choosing - Savulescu
    argues that egg freezing is\r\npotentially the most liberating reproductive advance
    since the\r\nintroduction of the contraceptive pill.\r\n\r\nJennifer Parks, in
    the prestigious feminist journal Hypatia, contends\r\nthat infertility treatments
    that enable older and even post-menopausal\r\nwomen to have children may be the
    only way for women to overcome the\r\nsocial inequities that force women - but
    not men - to â\x80\x9Cchooseâ\x80\x9D between\r\ncareer and motherhood.\r\n\r\nIn
    Victoria, only infertile couples are allowed access to infertility\r\ntreatments
    such as IVF. However, the use by fertile women of less\r\nethically contentious
    procedures such as egg and ovary freezing, is not\r\ntechnically prohibited. More
    importantly, both Melbourne IVF and the\r\nReproductive Biology Unit at the Royal
    Womenâ\x80\x99s are willing to speak to\r\nany woman who wishes to bank her eggs
    for future use.\r\n\r\nMonash IVFâ\x80\x99s medical director, Gab Kovacs, has
    no personal objections to\r\nfertile women having access to such technologies
    to preserve their\r\nfertility - as long as they are aware of the experimental
    nature of the\r\ntechnology, and the associated health risks.\r\n\r\nBoth Monash
    and Melbourne IVF assist women approaching or beyond\r\nmenopause to become mothers
    using donor eggs and HRT. Melbourne IVF\r\nroutinely treats women up to the age
    of 48, while Monash is unconcerned\r\nabout age until a woman turns 45.\r\n\r\nBut
    while Melbourne IVFâ\x80\x99s clinical chairman, John McBain, seeks to\r\ndiscourage
    women suffering empty-nest syndrome from using the technology\r\nin the hope of
    having another baby, he is sympathetic to women whose\r\nefforts to maintain or
    advance in their job prohibited them from\r\npartnering and/or procreating in
    their more fertile years. And McBain\r\nisnâ\x80\x99t alone in his sympathetic
    desire to help post-menopausal women\r\nattain motherhood. Last year, Adelaideâ\x80\x99s
    Queen Elizabeth Hospital helped\r\na 53-year-old woman give birth to triplets.\r\n\r\nIt
    is not hard to see why some ethicists, infertility treatment experts\r\nand women
    see infertility treatment as their best hope of obtaining the\r\nsame educational,
    employment and parenting opportunities as have long\r\nbeen enjoyed by men. To
    access them, a woman doesnâ\x80\x99t need to change the\r\nworld, she just needs
    money. For some women, such treatments may be seen\r\nas a way to quietly bypass
    a system that forces them to confront their\r\nmost demanding career hurdles at
    the same times as they confront their\r\nreproductive shelf-life.\r\n\r\nBut,
    unfortunately, there are a number of problems with such individual\r\nattempts
    to beat the system. The most important one, according to McBain\r\nand Kovacs,
    is the experimental nature of interventions such as egg and\r\novary freezing.
    Egg freezing has an extremely low success rate. McBain\r\nworries that women will
    squander their natural fertility because media\r\nreports about new reproductive
    technologies give them a false sense of\r\nsecurity about their prospects of using
    such technology to achieve a\r\nmature-age pregnancy in the future.\r\n\r\nIn
    addition, infertility treatment is time-consuming, expensive and\r\ninvasive -
    and so may pose risks to womenâ\x80\x99s health. While a large\r\nlongitudinal
    study conducted by the Centre for the Study of Mothersâ\x80\x99 and\r\nChildrenâ\x80\x99s
    Health at La Trobe University suggests there is no higher\r\nincidence of cancer
    among women in the short and medium term, we cannot\r\nyet know whether such promising
    findings will continue indefinitely.\r\n\r\nFertility experts agree that the best
    strategy for women who want\r\nchildren is to attempt pregnancy before or around
    the age of 30. As a\r\nsociety, we can approach such well-meaning advice in two
    ways: we can\r\nignore it, and enable women with the financial means to attempt
    their\r\nown private solutions to age-related childlessness by using these\r\ntreatments;
    or we can restructure the way that we work.\r\n\r\nAs numerous recent studies
    of the Australian workplace have concluded,\r\ncorporate values continue to suppose
    that employees are free from family\r\nand other non-workplace commitments.\r\n\r\nMoreover,
    education patterns ensure that both women and men are in their\r\npeak childbearing
    years at precisely the same time as they are under\r\nmost pressure to prove themselves
    and to advance at work.\r\n\r\nChanges to the way we work and the creation of
    pro-family social\r\npolicies that support all families with children (not just
    those in\r\nwhich the woman doesnâ\x80\x99t work) are two critical steps to ensuring
    women\r\nare truly free to choose when and whether they will have children."
