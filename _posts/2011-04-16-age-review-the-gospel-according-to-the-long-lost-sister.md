    what sacred texts invite...\r\n\r\nThe Book of Rchael is an energetic and passionate
    revision of the story of Jesus, here known as Joshua, and more particularly of

    she is one of seven siblings...From the outset it is clear that Rachael isn't
    going to take a back seat....\r\n\r\nIt is as a healer that Rachael meets Simeon
    of Iscariot and, through him, his son Judah, usually known as Jusas with whom
    she falls head over heels in love. The contrast between Judah, a hot-head and
    man of action and Joshua, Rachael's famous brother, a teacher and wisdom figure,
    is at the core of the novel. It mirrors the contrast between Bindy and Rachael;
    the tension between wisdom and aggression is great material and Cannold explores
    it with a kind of sure vision. \r\n\r\nJoshua's decision to side with the poor,
    especially with marginalised women leads to his undoing. He is not so much betrayed
    by Judah as misunderstood by a friend who wants to protect him and thereby causes
    his death, leaving Rachael separated from both her brother and husband. The scene
    of the death of Joshua, as with so much in this book, is beautifully crafted. "
