    comments in\r\nParliament early this week about the rectitude of mandatory detention\r\nand
    public support for it, tipped me over the edge. The time has come\r\nfor some
    clarity in the minds of public figures and commentators about\r\nwhat public support
    for something does - and does not mean - in terms of\r\nmorality.\r\n\r\nIn fact,
    the Prime Minister was clearer than most. At least his\r\nassertion that the mandatory
    detention policy was both â\x80\x9Crightâ\x80\x9D and\r\nsupported by Australians
    attempted to discriminate between the morally\r\ncorrect and the popularly acclaimed.
    Many commentators never get that\r\nfar. At a public lecture at an esteemed university
    last year, I listened\r\nto a highly regarded intellectual give a speech in which
    she both\r\nbemoaned the Howardâ\x80\x99s governmentâ\x80\x99s failure to heed
    the majority when it\r\ncame to the war in Iraq AND rolled her eyes about the
    ignorant\r\nimmorality of the masses when it came to mandatory detention. In the\r\nfirst
    instance, mass support was used as evidence of moral rectitude. In\r\nthe second,
    the lack of it was, too. You canâ\x80\x99t have it both ways, I\r\npointed out
    at question time. From her expression, it was clear the\r\ncontradiction never
    crossed her mind.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, shock-jocks and politicians dump on
    judges for\r\nsentences they deem to be â\x80\x9Cout of touchâ\x80\x9D with â\x80\x9Ccommunity
    standardsâ\x80\x9D, as\r\nif this misalignment was proof positive the judges got
    it wrong. Yet\r\nanother demonstration of confusion amongst those who really ought
    to\r\nknow better .\r\n\r\nThe truth is that there is no necessary relationship
    between whatâ\x80\x99s\r\npopular and whatâ\x80\x99s right. At the end of the
    1800s in the US, the\r\nmajority supported slavery; this century most Afrikaners
    supported\r\napartheid. Until relatively recently, in historical terms, many\r\nAustralians
    gave the White Australia policy a tic.\r\n\r\nWhy is confusion about whatâ\x80\x99s
    ethical, and whatâ\x80\x99s popular, so rife?\r\nPerhaps itâ\x80\x99s to do with
    the importance to politicians of public opinion.\r\nIf what matters - and according
    to some democratic theory anyway - what\r\nought to matter to politicians is what
    the public thinks, than public\r\nopinion rightly becomes the arbiter of good
    and bad political behavior.\r\nFrom there, the equation of good political performance
    with good moral\r\nperformance doesnâ\x80\x99t require much slippage.\r\n\r\nOr
    maybe the belief, widely-spruiked by populist politicians, that\r\nâ\x80\x9Caverage
    Australiansâ\x80\x9D score highly when it comes to common-sense\r\nmorality is
    to blame. Since by definition, most of us are â\x80\x9Caverageâ\x80\x9D\r\nAustralians,
    this equates majority views with moral ones.\r\n\r\nYet the truth is that public
    support for a policy indicates noting more\r\nthan that most people like it. To
    gain an ethical seal of approval, the\r\npolicy must conform to more abstract
    standards about decision-making\r\nwisdom, maximal utility or principles that
    crudely reduce to the golden\r\nrule and a steadfast commitment to never using
    others as a means to our\r\nends.\r\n\r\nAccording to any such criteria, serious
    questions can be raised about\r\nthe Prime Ministerâ\x80\x99s claim that the governmentâ\x80\x99s
    approach to\r\nunauthorized arrivals is â\x80\x9Crightâ\x80\x9D. And following
    this, that he would be\r\nright to gag debate on the Private Memberâ\x80\x99s
    bills designed to make the\r\npolicy more compassionate and fair.\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s
    hard to argue that a person of good character would permit others\r\nwhoâ\x80\x99ve
    committed no crime - and have good odds of eventually being found\r\nto be a refugee
    - to be detained for lengthy periods or indefinitely.\r\nThis makes the governmentâ\x80\x99s
    migration policy problematic for those\r\nespousing Virtue Theory.\r\n\r\nUtilitarian
    ethicists are about weighing overall benefits against harms.\r\nCurrent migration
    policy was adopted to contain the claimed risks posed\r\nby large numbers of bogus
    asylum seekers, yet since its inception\r\nchanged politics in the regional have
    seen such arrivals slow to a\r\ntrickle. The cost to individual asylum seekers,
    however, remains vast\r\nand includes physical and mental health problems that
    in some cases lead\r\nto self-harm and - when it comes to children - what experts
    claim may be\r\nirreversible developmental damage. Negligible benefits and vast
    and\r\nsignificant harms: whereâ\x80\x99s the morality in that?\r\n\r\nFinally,
    at the heart of â\x80\x9Cdo unto othersâ\x80\x9D is a recognition of the human\r\nneeds
    - and human rights - of others. Yet while the Government\r\nrecognizes the human
    rights of Australians, detainees are treated as\r\nthough they are less than fully
    human and therefore somehow deserving of\r\nthe loss of dignity, justice and freedom
    they suffer. To put it simply,\r\nwe have duties to these people - to honour their
    rights and of care -\r\nthat we are failing to meet.\r\n\r\nSo while it may not
    be popular to say it, I find little in ethical\r\ntheory to persuade me that the
    Governmentâ\x80\x99s policy of mandatory\r\ndetention is right. If the Prime Minister
    believes otherwise, he should\r\nwelcome debate on the issue, rather than attempt
    to gag it, as a chance\r\nto make his case."
