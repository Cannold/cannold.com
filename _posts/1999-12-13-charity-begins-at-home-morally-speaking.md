    of human failings has been rife in The Age these past few weeks.\r\nFirst Peter
    Singer castigated us for spending spare dollars on luxuries\r\nrather than the
    needs of the worldâ\x80\x99s poor. Then Pamela Bone contrasted\r\nour ridiculous
    sentimentality for euthanased animals with our supposed\r\nindifference to starving
    children.\r\n\r\nSinger has spent much of his professional life trying to convince
    us the\r\ncompassion we feel for those we love is a moral failing. Such feelings\r\ncloud
    our judgment and get in the way of a dispassionate assessment of\r\nthe more deserving
    object of our ethical attention. Should his mother\r\nand a scientist known to
    be on the cusp of a cure for cancer both fall\r\noff a boat, with the time to
    save only one, Singer has argued he would\r\nand should save the scientist.\r\n\r\nWhen
    the New Yorker revealed that Singer spends his own money on private\r\nnursing
    care for his Alzheimerâ\x80\x99s-affected mother rather than on feeding\r\nthe
    worldâ\x80\x99s poor, many believed Singer a hypocrite.\r\n\r\nThe truth is far
    worse. Paying for the private nursing is not Singerâ\x80\x99s\r\nway of acknowledging
    he has been mistaken all these years about the\r\nvalue of the love, fidelity,
    gratitude and reciprocity that go into the\r\npartial attachment he has to his
    mother. Rather, Singerâ\x80\x99s spending\r\npatterns simply reveal him to have
    an embarrassing weakness of will; an\r\ninability to live up to the standards
    he believes right. It is different\r\nwhen itâ\x80\x99s your mother, he said sheepishly.\r\n\r\nThe
    compassion we feel for those we love and to whom we are responsible\r\nis not
    a moral failing. The whole concept of intimate and enduring\r\nrelationships becomes
    a nonsense if we are unable to love or be\r\ncommitted to certain people, and
    act on those commitments.\r\n\r\nWhat would we feel about the person who didnâ\x80\x99t
    instinctively move\r\ntowards their drowning mother? Or the parent who walks out
    the door with\r\na cheery \\`\\`Sorry dear, canâ\x80\x99t go to your school play,
    got to feed the\r\nstarving children in Africaâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99?\r\n\r\nI also
    donâ\x80\x99t believe the strong reader response to The Ageâ\x80\x99s report on\r\nculling
    at Melbourneâ\x80\x99s zoos means these readers lack the right amount of\r\ncompassion
    for starving children. Not only do we want, and need, to\r\nfocus most of our
    compassion on those for whom we care and feel\r\nresponsible, we also, like Singer,
    want to act on such feelings. We feel\r\ncompassion for the animals in the zoos.
    But, more importantly, we feel\r\nwe understand the problem (a zoo policy that
    allows healthy animals to\r\nbe put down) and believe we have the power to change
    it.\r\n\r\nWorld hunger is a different kettle of fish. I feel confident most people\r\nfeel
    as much compassion - if not more - for starving humanity as they do\r\nfor the
    meerkats. However, I suspect many are far less confident about\r\nthe cause of
    the problem, and what they can do to help.\r\n\r\nBack in the 1970s, I gave my
    weekly allowance to an organisation\r\ncollecting for the starving people of Ethiopia.
    The television\r\nvoice-overs sourced the tragedy to the ravages of drought. I
    still\r\nremember the shock of discovering - years later - that the real source\r\nof
    food shortages in that part of the world is civil unrest.\r\n\r\nOf course, starvation
    is starvation, whatever the cause, and it is\r\nhighly improbable those doing
    the starving had any say in how the good\r\npeople collecting aid moneys made
    their case. But the point is that when\r\nwe give money, we trust that the agency
    taking our funds actually\r\nunderstands the problem, and is giving it to us straight.
    Discovering\r\nthis is not the case may leave us feeling used and deceived.\r\n\r\nThis
    sense of disempowerment is exacerbated by the relentlessness of the\r\nworldâ\x80\x99s
    problems. If the policy is changed at the zoos, there will be a\r\nsatisfying
    sense of closure. (There! Thatâ\x80\x99s fixed and I helped.) There\r\nwill also,
    in all likelihood, be a long break before there is a need to\r\nfeel for and act
    on behalf of those animals again.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the never-ending stream
    of misery pouring from our radios\r\nand televisions offers neither closure nor
    respite from the insistent\r\nfeeling - engendered by our compassion - that we
    are obligated to help.\r\nWhen will it all end, we wonder. Nothing ever changes,
    we wail. Like the\r\ndogs in the learned helplessness experiments, many of us
    resign\r\nourselves to the daily onslaught of un-met human misery, convinced\r\nthereâ\x80\x99s
    no point in trying to make things different, and no longer\r\nwilling to try.\r\n\r\nI
    am not excusing our reluctance or refusal to do what we can for\r\nunknown others
    in need. Most of us can and should do more. Indeed, I\r\nlike Singerâ\x80\x99s
    suggestion that we donate 10percent of our earnings to\r\ncharity. But we betray
    a fundamental misunderstanding of the feelings\r\nand behavior necessary to maintain
    meaningful human relationships -\r\nfamilies, friendships, communities - when
    we dismiss as moral weakness\r\nour honoring of the impulse to put the needs of
    our own children,\r\nparents and friends first.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, it is
    far too glib to propose a compassion deficit as\r\nthe reason relatively little
    fuss is made when images of starvation in\r\nfar-away lands hit the front page.
    It is far more likely our silence is\r\nthe outcome of our inability to understand
    the nature of the problem,\r\nand our helpless belief that nothing we do will
    make a damn bit of\r\ndifference."
