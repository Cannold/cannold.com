  content: "The Moral of the Story: An anthology of ethics through literature edited\r\nby
    Peter Singer and Renata Singer RRP: $49.95\r\n\r\nOver my (far too) many years
    of studentship and academic\r\nemployment, I have bought (far too) many books,
    (far too) many of which\r\nhave stagnated on my shelves, growing dusty and churlish
    from disuse.\r\nAmongst this unedifying lot have never been tomes edited or authored
    by\r\nPeter Singer. This is not because it is impossible to disagree with\r\nSinger,
    or to occasionally find his fearless exploration of the most\r\ncomplex, sensitive
    and interesting ethical issues of our times\r\nunsatisfying terse and one-dimensional.
    But rather because with the\r\nexception of de Botton, Singer is without peer
    when it comes to picking\r\nthe right topic and penning erudite and accessible
    prose steeped in\r\ncasual references to philosophical debates on similar issues
    dating back\r\nthousands of years. In The Moral of the Story, written in partnership\r\nwith
    wife Renata, he does it again, compiling an anthology that\r\nstudents, academic
    philosophers and writers interested in ethics (and\r\nwhat writer isnâ\x80\x99t)
    will pull off the shelf to thumb through again and\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe Singers
    describe themselves as editors of The Moral of the Story but\r\nthey are much
    more. Clearly dedicated readers of quality fiction, they\r\ndo a superlative job
    at what Iâ\x80\x99m sure was the humbling task of selecting\r\n- then editing
    for purpose and sense - the back-list of western\r\ncivilisation. Having been
    refused permission by a number of authors,\r\nincluding American Psycho author
    Bret Easton Ellis, to anthologise their\r\nwork in the collection, they ultimately
    settle on 79 excerpts by 61\r\nauthors. These include pieces from Genesis, Sophocles,
    Shelly, Ibsen,\r\nDickens, Arna Bontemps, James Baldwin, S. Yizhar, Ursula Le
    Guin, Joyce\r\nCarol Oates, Kathy Lette and the comic writer Douglas Adams.\r\n\r\nI
    was familiar with about one quarter of the material, though\r\ninterestingly I
    found this neither diminished (through repetition) or\r\nenhanced (because of
    my stored bank of additional knowledge of character\r\nand plot) my enjoyment
    of the material. Instead, the pruning of each\r\nselection and its filing under
    a particular section heading (as a story\r\nexploring â\x80\x9CDuties to Godâ\x80\x9D
    or the moral issues that arise around paid\r\nâ\x80\x9CWorkâ\x80\x9D or â\x80\x9CWarâ\x80\x9D)
    refocused my attention on a previously unconsidered\r\naspect of a particular
    tale, giving the story - no matter how familiar -\r\nnew life.\r\n\r\nBut the
    real value-add comes in the Preface to collection, and the\r\nSingersâ\x80\x99
    introduction to each of the bookâ\x80\x99s 15 sections. Here they set\r\nthe ethical
    scene, introducing the issues in play - and the conflict of\r\nvalues that typically
    arise - when considering, say, â\x80\x9CDuties to Kinâ\x80\x9D,\r\nâ\x80\x9CNew
    Life Formsâ\x80\x9D or â\x80\x9CAnimals and the Environmentâ\x80\x9D. As well,
    those\r\ninterested in using the bookâ\x80\x99s fictional excerpts as a teaching
    aid will\r\nfind a range of issues and pertinent questions arising from each\r\nselection
    compiled at the back.\r\n\r\nSome of these introductions are done extremely well.
    I was particularly\r\nimpressed with the one on â\x80\x9CLove, marriage and sexâ\x80\x9D,
    in which the authors\r\nobserve that while the decision of whether and who to
    marry will â\x80\x9Chave\r\nmore impact on our lives than most other decision
    we makeâ\x80\x9D, there has\r\nbeen â\x80\x9Crelatively little serious discussion
    about the values underlying\r\nthe choice of mateâ\x80\x9D. They then briefly
    explore the various literary\r\nmodels of the ideal romantic relationship: Shakespeareâ\x80\x99s
    depiction of\r\nsudden passionate love in Romeo and Juliet; de Maupassantâ\x80\x99s
    contention\r\nin The Model that lasting love requires a â\x80\x9Cdeeper union
    of the mindsâ\x80\x9D;\r\nSethâ\x80\x99s suggestion, made through Lataâ\x80\x99s
    ultimate choice of Haresh for her\r\nhusband in A Suitable Boy, that arranged
    marriages based upon common\r\nvalues provides the firmest foundation for mature
    love to eventually\r\nflourish.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, other such preemptory remarks
    are less consistent with\r\nthe spirit of inquiry, rather than argument, that
    rightly characterises\r\nan exploration of ethics through literature. Indeed,
    what the authors\r\nseem to miss in their early discussion of the key differences
    in the way\r\nliterature and philosophy approach ethics is the ultimately different\r\naims
    of each for doing so. The aim of philosophical argument is to prove\r\nthe rightness
    of oneâ\x80\x99s own claims, in part, by exposing the flaws in our\r\nopponentsâ\x80\x99
    arguments. In contrast, the best books and plays resist the\r\ntemptation to argue
    conclusively for a particular point of view.\r\nInstead, they seek to deepen our
    emotional understanding of the\r\ncomplexity and profundity of particular value
    conflicts by putting the\r\nsharpest most persuasive arguments in the mouths of
    the characters on\r\nboth side of the case. This not only sharpens the value conflict
    and\r\nconsequently the drama, but grants legitimacy to the existence of the\r\nconflict
    in the first place.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CThereâ\x80\x99s no need to fight about these
