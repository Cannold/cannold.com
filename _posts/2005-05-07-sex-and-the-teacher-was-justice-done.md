    Ellis? On Thursday, the Court of Appeals threw out the 22 month\r\nsuspended sentence
    handed down in November by the County Court and\r\nre-sentenced the 37 year old
    school teacher to nearly three years, 6\r\nmonths of which she must serve in jail.
    The ruling found the initial\r\nsentence had violated the principle of equality,
    including â\x80\x9Cequality of\r\nconcern for male and female victims and equality
    in the sentencing of\r\nmale and female offenders.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CIt
    is no longer acceptable,â\x80\x9D said Justice Callaway, who presided over\r\nthe
    appeal, â\x80\x9Cthat an offender be given a different sentence solely\r\nbecause
    of his or her sex.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nFor many, the facts of the Ellis case justified
    leniency. Ellis had made\r\nfull and frank admissions of her guilt and saved the
    State the expense\r\nof a trial. She was clearly remorseful, lacked self pity
    and has already\r\nsuffered significant costs related to her trial and conviction.
    Her\r\ncareer is finished as she can no longer work with children, her\r\nplacement
    on the sexual offenders registry - despite the courtâ\x80\x99s view\r\nthat she
    is â\x80\x9Cvery unlikelyâ\x80\x9D to re-offend - ensures a future of\r\nconsiderable
    imposition and embarrassment for her and her three children\r\nand the absence
    of a wedding ring at yesterdayâ\x80\x99s hearing suggests her\r\nmarriage is in
    trouble.\r\n\r\nAs well, the thenâ\x80\x9315 year old student Benjamin has insisted
    that he knew\r\nat all times what he was doing and wanted to do it. He has even
    tendered\r\nferociously loyal statements to the Court in support of his former\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\nBut
    Ellis victimised more than Benjamin. Her behaviour was an abuse of\r\nboth her
    power, and the trust placed in her - and those of all teachers\r\n- by students,
    colleagues, employers, parents and society as a whole.\r\nMoreover, while sex
    was not forced - if it was, the charge would have\r\nbeen rape rather than penetration
    - the law holds that children under\r\nsixteen simply lack the competence to consent
    to sexual activity with an\r\nadult, particularly an adult in a position of power
    and authority. And\r\ndespite Benâ\x80\x99s assertion of being unusually mature
    for his age, the Court\r\nfound that his statements reflected an â\x80\x9Cinsouciance
    about the moral\r\nissues involvedâ\x80\x9D that would be â\x80\x9Cdisturbingâ\x80\x9D
    coming from anyone who\r\nwasnâ\x80\x99t so young. Indeed, his Honour suggests
    the possibility that Ellis\r\nmay have stunted Benâ\x80\x99s moral development,
    given the approval her\r\nbehaviour signalled to irresponsible sexual relationships
    and activity.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate sexism test is to read a roll call of Ellisâ\x80\x99s
    crimes and to\r\nsubstitute male pronouns for female ones when the reference is
    to the\r\nteacher, and female for male when the student is discussed. Try it\r\nyourself
    on the summary of the facts of the case Iâ\x80\x99ve excerpted from the\r\nCourt
    of Appealâ\x80\x99s ruling:\r\n\r\nA 36-year-old married teacher begins kissing
    her 15-year-old year 10\r\nstudent during secret meetings at school. Soon after,
    she collects him\r\nin her car, drives to her house and they have sex upstairs
    in the\r\nmarital bed. One month later she collects the student and drives to
    her\r\nhouse to have sex. After she drops him off near his home in the early\r\nhours
    of the morning. This happens again a few days later, after which\r\nshe drops
    him near the school. Days later she collects him at the train\r\nstation and she
    performs oral sex on him at her house followed, the next\r\nmorning, by intercourse.
    On her day off, she collects him at the school\r\nand again drives him to her
    house to have sex.\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99ll be frank, and admit my feelings did change
    depending on whether the\r\npronoun-conjured offender was male or female (though
    interestingly the\r\nsex of the victim had little impact on my feelings of disgust
    and\r\noutrage). The truth is, I intuitively felt more sympathy for the female\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\nYears
    ago I remember feeling dismayed by a study showing that students\r\nwere more
    likely to rate the exact same essay highly if the name at the\r\ntop was John,
    instead of Josephine, Doe. The truth is that our\r\nunconscious views about the
    capacities, culpability and characters of\r\nmen and women do shape the way we
    understand events, and render\r\njudgements about fault.\r\n\r\nBut this is not
    how it ought to be, and the Appeals Court has been right\r\nto say so, and to
    ensure that in the Ellis case, justice was finally\r\ndone."
