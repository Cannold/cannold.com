    have joined lawyers and judges in accepting formal\r\nobligations to either disclose
    personal or financial links they have\r\nwith those they report on or serve, to
    divest themselves of those links\r\nor to recuse themselves.\r\n\r\nThis makes
    it odd then that, when it comes to government inquiries, the\r\nmoral obligations
    we all have to disclose, divest or recuse where\r\nconflicts of interests exist,
    remain optional. Iâ\x80\x99ve given evidence at a\r\nfair few inquiries and hearings,
    and while within the hearing room the\r\naffiliations of certain witnesses-relevant
    links that may reveal fiscal\r\nor moral conflicts of interest - are poorly-kept
    secrets, what happens\r\nin the hearing room stays in the hearing room. When the
    final report\r\nappears only those credentials that witnesses choose to disclose,
    rather\r\nthan all those the public might deem relevant, appear in print.\r\n\r\nBut
    this may be set to change, with a new report on by the UK Science\r\nand Technology
    Committee confronting the issue of witness transparency\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\nIt
    all started when the Committee, appointed by the House of Commons,\r\nundertook
    an investigation of scientific developments relating to the\r\nAbortion Act of
    1967. When submissions began arriving members noticed\r\nthat some doctors were
    opining on and interpreting evidence in areas in\r\nwhich they had neither practiced,
    researched nor published. Turns out,\r\nmost of these contributions were from
    individuals who had a history of\r\nactive campaigning against a womanâ\x80\x99s
    right to choose.\r\n\r\nIn line with its own previously articulated recommendations
    on\r\nevidence-based policy-making, the committee swung into action, requiring\r\nall
    witnesses to come clean and, in keeping with â\x80\x9Caccepted practice in\r\nthe
    scientific community,â\x80\x9D disclose all relevant interests and\r\nexpertise,
    including previous publication of strong views on abortion,\r\nor membership of
    organizations campaigning on the issue.\r\n\r\nAll hell broke loose. Some pro-lifers
    did come clean (Australiaâ\x80\x99s own\r\nJohn Fleming, who in Australian debates
    on abortion tends to describe\r\nhimself as Dr Fleming from the Southern Cross
    Bioethics Institute, added\r\nthat he was also a Catholic Priest and President
    of Campion College,\r\nitself linked with Christendom College whose mission is
    to make Christâ\x80\x99s\r\nteachings the law of the land). But others refused,
    claiming to fear\r\nthat the truth would see their views discounted. Refusing
    to listen to\r\nthe Committeeâ\x80\x99s commitment that they would not, they insisted
    on their\r\nentitlement to deny the public and lawmakers the whole truth about
    who\r\nthey were and where they came from.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of concerns about
    transparency are those about autonomy,\r\nthe Greek roots of which mean self-rule.
    To rule our lives we need full\r\nand accurate information on which to base our
    decisions. Conflict of\r\ninterest disclosures help us decide how much weight
    to give to the\r\nopinions and evidence offered us by those claiming to know.
    Ignorance of\r\nall relevant facts about those seeking to influence us undermines
    the\r\nintegrity of our decisions, weakening our grip on our lives. Because it\r\nmay
    have been the case that if we had known the whole truth about the\r\nperson whose
    words and facts swayed us, we might not have given them so\r\nmuch weight - and
