  content: "Today, we learned about the death of a 28-year-old pregnant woman from
    Sydney. She didnâ\x80\x99t die today. She died last year, or perhaps even earlier.
    But we are hearing her story now because of a letter two of the womenâ\x80\x99s
    doctors have written about the case.\r\n\r\nThe letter, published in a medical
    journal and reported today by the Sydney Morning Herald, tells of a woman who
    arrived at the Prince of Wales hospital at 28-weeks, suffering from pre-eclampsia
    â\x80\x93 a severe complication of pregnancy. Things go from bad to worse when
    medical staff diagnosed acute promyeloctyic leukaemia.\r\n\r\nShe was offered
    a c-section. However, the woman was a Jehovahâ\x80\x99s Witness who objected to
    the transfusion of blood. The team withdraw the offer, fearing the woman would
    bleed to death on the table. Instead, cancer treatment was begun. The fetus died
    shortly after and was expelled without incident but the woman ended up having
    a stroke and extreme fevers. Her organs failed and, on day 13, life support was
    withdrawn.\r\n\r\nIn their letter, the doctors talk about the devastation of the
    staff at what was perceived as two â\x80\x9Cavoidableâ\x80\x9D deaths. The distress
    of the womanâ\x80\x99s loved ones, who had been expecting a new baby but instead
    found themselves organising a double funeral, can only be imagined.\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s
    an understatement to say that the case raises some very difficult questions:\r\n\r\nWere
    mistakes made?\r\n\r\nDo patients have a legal and moral right to refuse medical
    interventions that could save their lives? Does this right trump all others, even
    when the patient in question is a pregnant woman?\r\n\r\nAre pregnant women no
    different to other patients, who are entitled to live and die according to their
    beliefs, no matter how inexplicable or cruel others may find them?\r\n\r\nAustralia
    and the jurisdictions that influence us â\x80\x93 the US and the UK â\x80\x93
    grant patients the right to refuse medical treatment.\r\n\r\nIn the last 20 years
    a series of common law judgements have affirmed the right of capable adults to
    refuse medical interventions, including food and drink, even where such refusal
    would likely cause injury or death.\r\n\r\nThe cases that wind up in court are
    those that care teams find most distressing or that medical institutions worry
    will cause legal grief later. They include a number of Jehovahâ\x80\x99s Witnesses
    refusing blood products, as well as young people with catastrophic injuries or
    illnesses refusing interventions that cause too many side effects or that prolong
    a life they no longer value.\r\n\r\nUnderlying these judgements, and the ethical
    framework that underpins them, is a the modern value placed on patient autonomy
    over medical paternalism. We used to think that our doctorâ\x80\x99s values should
    guide what they told us about our illness and the treatment choices available.
    If this meant we werenâ\x80\x99t told we had cancer, or wound up dying in hospital
    despite wanting to die at home, we took it on the chin. After all, the doctor
    knew best.\r\n\r\nThese days we understand that Australians hold a range of diverse
    beliefs and values about everything from western medical care to the meaning of
    life and death. Respecting those values â\x80\x93 really respecting them â\x80\x93
    requires medical staff to be open and transparent with patients abut their condition,
    to present a range of options, and to respect the choice the patient makes.\r\n\r\nWhat
    the Sydney case shows is that while this sounds simple, it can get seriously complex,
    especially when the choice can be life-limiting, and the beliefs on which it was
    made seem to some preposterous, baseless or dumb.\r\n\r\nIs there an alternative?
    One is to make an Orwellian exception to the principle that capable adults can
    refuse medical care. The exception would read: all capable adults except pregnant
    women.\r\n\r\nWould there be any justification for such a move? Not without resorting
    to the idea that pregnancy hormones so addle womenâ\x80\x99s brains that simply
    by being pregnant, women forgo their standing as capable adults. Weâ\x80\x99d
    also have to abandon the wisdom that hard cases make bad law, and abandon our
    commitment to transforming Anglo-Saxon law to recognise the full humanity of women.\r\n\r\nThere
    is another way. Instead of undermining pregnant patientsâ\x80\x99 rights, weâ\x80\x99d
    do well to better support the medical staff that enable women to realise them.
    The letter written by doctors at the Prince of Wales should be seen as a cry for
    help in this regard. It calls for a multi-disciplinary approach to decision-making,
    improved paperwork and more published information to assist physicians to manage
    their own anxieties, doubts and potential moral disagreement with patients.\r\n\r\nAmerican
    bioethicist George Annas says rare tragedies like the one at the Prince of Wales
    hospital in Sydney is the â\x80\x9Cthe price society pays for protecting the rights
    of all competent adults and preventing forcible, physical violations of women
    by coercive obstetricians and judges.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThe alternative is even
    more unthinkable."
