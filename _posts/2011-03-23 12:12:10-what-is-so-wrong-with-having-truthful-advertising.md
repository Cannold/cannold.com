  content: "The removal of the Federal Health Ministerâ\x80\x99s veto over RU486 last\r\nFebruary
    was hailed as a victory for women, and a portent of what could\r\nbe accomplished
    if politicians and grass roots activists worked together\r\nacross party lines.
    In the wake of the conscience vote, female\r\npoliticians suggested the victory
    was a taste of things to come. In the\r\nfuture, they would join hands to deliver
    women things like paid\r\nmaternity leave, accessible and affordable childcare
    and a more\r\nequitable tax system for families where both parents worked.\r\n\r\nBetter
    protection from deceptive and misleading advertising was not on\r\nthe list.\r\n\r\nBut
    it should have been. While Australia has an extensive web of\r\nconsumer protection
    regulations, there are loopholes. The most\r\nsignificant is that only services
    that charge a fee are prohibited from\r\nengaging in deceptive and misleading
    advertising. Those that offer free\r\nservices can advertise them in any way they
    please in the phone book, on\r\nthe web, in magazines and on posters placed in
    doctorâ\x80\x99s offices and\r\npolitics stations.\r\n\r\nAustralian women are
    hit hardest by this gap in legal protection, in\r\nparticular, women facing an
    unplanned pregnancy. This is because they\r\nare the targets of ads for â\x80\x9Ccounselingâ\x80\x9D
    by agencies that donâ\x80\x99t provide\r\nbalanced and accurate information about
    abortion and wonâ\x80\x99t refer women\r\nfor an abortion, or even to a service
    that they believe will.\r\n\r\nLetâ\x80\x99s be clear. The problem here is not
    that agencies exist that wonâ\x80\x99t\r\nrefer for termination. The problem is
    that such agencies donâ\x80\x99t clearly\r\nstate that this is their policy in
    their ads.\r\n\r\nThe push to put an end to such deception began last year with
    a private\r\nmemberâ\x80\x99s bill introduced by Natasha Stott Despoja. The compelling
    and\r\ncommonsense nature of the case against false advertising saw her joined\r\nearlier
    this year by Senators from most of the major parties to\r\nco-sponsor a simplified
    version of the Bill: Liberal Judith Troeth,\r\nLaborâ\x80\x99s Carol Brown and
    Greensâ\x80\x99 Kerry Nettle.\r\n\r\nLabor had promised to support the Pregnancy
    Counselling (Truth in\r\nAdvertising) Bill, which was introduced into Federal
    Parliament early\r\nthis year. Because the Greens and Democrats were already on
    board, its\r\nbacking would have meant that with only a few Liberals would have
    had to\r\ncross the floor - and the numbers were there - to make it law.\r\n\r\nBut
    last month the Labor leadership balked. When opponents of\r\ntransparent advertising
    voiced their disapproval in the party room the\r\nvote was â\x80\x9Cdeferredâ\x80\x9D.
    Oh, to be a fly on the wall at that caucus meeting.\r\nI mean, what exactly do
    those opposed to truth in advertising, in all\r\ninstances or just when it applies
    to pregnant women, say in support of\r\ntheir case? Deceptive means are OK when
    we think the ends - a claimed\r\nreduction in the abortion rate - are so good?
    Or do they instead, as\r\nmedia coverage of the Laborâ\x80\x99s leadership blink
    suggested was the case,\r\nsimply spread disinformation about what the Bill says,
    and what it will\r\ndo?\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the Bill is so short and simple
    that no\r\nLegalese-to-English dictionary is needed. It requires only that all\r\npregnancy
    counselling agencies include in their advertisements a\r\nstatement like â\x80\x9Cthis
    service does/does not provide referrals for\r\ntermination of pregnancyâ\x80\x9D.
    It does not require that any agency refer for\r\nabortion, and sanctions only
    agencies that persist in advertising\r\nthemselves in deceptive and misleading
    ways.\r\n\r\nThe issue was ignored at last weekendâ\x80\x99s Labor party conference
    and with\r\nthe budget set to dominate the next session of Federal Parliament,\r\nfollowed
    by the election, some now say the Bill has little chance of\r\nbecoming law.\r\n\r\nYet
    the situation remains urgent. Today, the Federal government launched\r\nits â\x80\x9Cpregnancy
    supportâ\x80\x9D telephone line as part of its $51 million dollar\r\nsuite of
    interventions to reduce what the Federal Health Minister Tony\r\nAbbott calls
    the â\x80\x9Cnational disgraceâ\x80\x9D of Australiaâ\x80\x99s abortion rate.
    The\r\nâ\x80\x9CHelplineâ\x80\x9D continues to inspire concern amongst Federal
    women Senators.\r\nSenator Stott Despoja, for instance, has recently worried that
    the\r\ntelephone line would not provide relevant or specific information or\r\nhelpful
    referrals. Because it will be a free service, anxiety about the\r\ntruthfulness
    of the ads run to notify the public of its existence are\r\nalso a concern.\r\n\r\nA
    new campaign, jointly sponsored by GetUp and Reproductive Choice\r\nAustralia,
    will urge Australians to support the passage of the\r\ncross-party truth in advertising
    Bill. Last year 20,000 citizens signed\r\na petition supporting honest advertising
    of pregnancy counselling\r\nservices. The current campaign aims to inform Australians
    that if they\r\nwant another RU486-type victory - an empowering piece of legislation
    by\r\nwomen for women - they need to make their support for the right of all\r\nAustralians
    to truthful advertising clear.\r\n\r\nWill a pro-transparency groundswell of public
    support be enough? I think\r\nyes. While well-funded and organised, supporters
    of deceptive and\r\nmisleading advertising are few in number. I feel confident
    that the\r\nmajority of decent Australians - once they realise that existing\r\nconsumer
    protection legislation leaves a vulnerable group of women out\r\nin the cold -
    will act to ensure their elected representatives know that\r\nthey strongly support
    change.\r\n\r\nRegardless of their personal view of abortion, most Australians\r\nunderstand
    that truth in advertising is the basis of informed consent\r\nand individual choice,
    and that these principles - core to our liberal\r\npluralist democracy - must
    not be traded away."
