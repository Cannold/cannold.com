    The child, if born, will be her third. If she\r\nmiscarries, it will be for the
    third time, too.\r\n\r\nShe wants the baby but, because of this history, is loath
    to reveal her\r\nsituation to her prospective employer. She doesnâ\x80\x99t even
    want friends or\r\nfamily to know, so why should an interview panel be privy to
    her private\r\nnews? And if she cruels her chance of employment by telling, then\r\nmiscarries
    again, sheâ\x80\x99ll be left with nothing - neither baby nor job.\r\nSheâ\x80\x99s
    done this before, withdrawn from a selection process for a\r\nonce-in-a-lifetime
    opportunity, only to lose the pregnancy.\r\n\r\nStill she worries about misleading,
    or worse, being unfair. The law\r\nmatters here. Law and ethics are different
    but practical moral advice\r\nmust account for what the law forbids or requires.
    Although NSW law\r\nallows employers not to hire a woman if she is expecting at
    the time of\r\ninterview, in most cases a refusal to employ a woman because she
    is\r\npregnant violates federal anti-discrimination law.\r\n\r\nThis means that
    if an employer uses a job seekerâ\x80\x99s disclosure of\r\npregnancy as a reason
    not to hire her, he is likely to be breaking the\r\nlaw: something job applicants
    are under no obligation to facilitate. If\r\nthe employer heeds the law and disregards
    fertility status when making\r\nemployment decisions, why should a woman be duty-bound
    to tell?\r\n\r\nBut even if the woman is not legally obliged to disclose her pregnancy,\r\nis
    she morally bound to do so? I think not, for two reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst, because
    the implications of a positive pregnancy test in the\r\nmonths after conception
    are unclear. The one in five Australian\r\nmiscarriage rate means that while the
    result could indicate impending\r\nmotherhood, it may not. I ride my bike to work
    each day; a friend has\r\nhigh blood pressure. We all present some risk to our
    employers that we\r\nmight fall off our perch. If they need human resources to
    do the work,\r\nit is a risk they must take.\r\n\r\nSecond, because if women have
    a duty to report all would-be pregnancies\r\nto a would-be boss, the workplace
    discrimination and disadvantage they\r\nalready suffer is likely to increase.
    Why should women be obliged to\r\nincrease the challenges they already face -
    as a result of sexism, and\r\nstructural barriers to work-family balance - in
    landing, keeping and\r\nmaking headway in a job?\r\n\r\nThe truth is that most
    sexually active women aged 13 to 50 are at risk\r\nof being pregnant. If these
    facts of female fertility, as against the\r\nmale sort, are seen as legitimate
    grounds for employer discrimination\r\nthen equal opportunity for women will remain
    a pipe dream: an ideal to\r\nwhich we pay lip service but are unwilling to do
    the hard work to\r\nachieve.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that once hired and sure
    the pregnancy will stick, a\r\npregnant woman ought not disclose to her employer,
    and do all she can to\r\nensure that the requirements of the position are met
    when she leaves.\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s easy to mouth platitudes about equal opportunity.
    Easy to tell our\r\ndaughters that they can achieve anything they want in this
    world. Easy\r\nto assert that a commitment to gender equity is what makes Western\r\ncivilisations
    so different and great.\r\n\r\nA dilemma like this puts such sentiments to the
