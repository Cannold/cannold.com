    became\r\ncrowded with steak and hamburgers and my midwife diagnosed me with low\r\nlevels
    of iron. Another pregnancy and more than a decade later, I have\r\nnever looked

    people donâ\x80\x99t know it, but the central claim in Professor Peter\r\nSingerâ\x80\x99s
    revolutionary book Animal Liberation is that because animals\r\nsuffer, they are
    owed moral consideration. The sort of moral\r\nconsideration that requires we
    humans to eliminate any unnecessary\r\nsuffering, and reduce as much as possible
    the suffering justified by the\r\ngreater good: like that caused by scientific
    experiments which will\r\nyield important results that can not be obtained in
    any other way.\r\n\r\nThis means that while vegetarianism is a good way of meeting
    our moral\r\nobligations to animals, it is not the only one. Another is to commit\r\nourselves
    to only consuming animal products that have been farmed in\r\nethical ways: in
    way that mean that the animal does not suffer during\r\nits life or, as far as
    is possible, in the slaughtering process.\r\n\r\nDoes this mean ethical carnivores
    eat less meat? Almost certainly yes,\r\nas most restaurants serve factory-farmed
    products, so most meat-eating\r\nmust be done at home. But it also means that
    when we take the time and\r\npay the cash for free-range pork, chicken and eggs,
    we can consume it\r\nguilt-free.\r\n\r\nThe Lucy ad is the latest in a long-line
    of attempts by animal\r\nliberationists to inform us of the intense, unnecessary
    and unjustified\r\nsuffering of intensively farmed animals. Animals that may spend
    their\r\nentire lives in darkness and in cramped boxes that deny them the freedom\r\nto
    stretch, turn, or even stand, little less perform any of their normal\r\nbehavioral
    repertoire like scratching or nursing young. Animals whose\r\nsuffering should
    and does move us.\r\n\r\nEthical carnivores accept that the indifference of western
    consumers to\r\nthe suffering of animals is a consequence of our removal from
    the\r\ngruesome and inhumane conditions in which most live and die. We accept\r\nthat
    it is our obligation to look at the reality of the lives of the\r\nanimals whose
    flesh and products we consume, and accept responsibility\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nBut
    we believe that turning vegetarian or vegan is not the only way to\r\ndo this.
    Another is to make sure that the life of the animal we consume\r\nhave been managed
    with care."
