    Review into the Public Health Response into the Adverse\r\nEvents to the Seasonal
    Influenza Vaccine sought to uncover the reason\r\nfor â\x80\x9Can alarming rise
    in adverse events following immunisationâ\x80\x9D that\r\nincluded vomiting, diarrhoea
    and febrile convulsions. Four weeks after\r\nthe vaccination program began, Australiaâ\x80\x99s
    chief medical officer advised\r\ndoctors across the country to stop giving the
    shot to children under\r\nfive.\r\n\r\nWe still do not know what caused the estimated
    800 per cent increase in\r\nthe number of febrile convulsions experienced by children
    who got the\r\njab this year. But the review does shed light on other aspects
    of the\r\nhealth scare.\r\n\r\nFirst, it reveals an adverse event reporting system
    that is cumbersome\r\nand grossly unequal to its task of early detection of problems.
    There is\r\nno single agency responsible for monitoring and neither of those\r\ninvolved
    - including the Therapeutic Goods Administration - make it easy\r\nfor parents
    and GPs to log adverse events. Existing methods of compiling\r\nand analysing
    various floaty bits of paper are slow and inefficient.\r\n\r\nAdd to this the
    inability to ascertain the total number of injections\r\ngiven - the all important
    denominator figure essential to knowing\r\nwhether the reported number of adverse
    events is higher than expected -\r\nand you have a system the report describes
    as neither â\x80\x9Crobust or\r\ntimelyâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nIt also fails to conform
    to World Health Organisation recommendations on\r\nmass immunisation programs.
    Each year Australia has only a short period\r\nto develop and test the seasonal
    influenza vaccine before it must be\r\napproved and manufactured. This means clinical
    trials are limited and\r\nthat - to quote the WHO - â\x80\x9Cfurther testing of
    safety and effectiveness\r\nwill need to take place after administration of the
    vaccine has begunâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, countries must implement post-vaccine
    surveillance\r\nsystems that monitor the product for safety and efficacy. However,\r\nAustraliaâ\x80\x99s
    doesnâ\x80\x99t. Not only are our usual monitoring systems plagued\r\nby structural
    deficiencies but we also failed to keep in place the\r\nmonitoring the WHO recommended
    for the swine flu pandemic shots.\r\n\r\nThis was particularly unfortunate, the
    review notes, given that the 2010\r\nimmunisation was â\x80\x9Csignificantly differentâ\x80\x9D
    to previous seasonal flu\r\nvaccinations and the program involved very young children.\r\n\r\nNeedless
    to say, parents knew none of this. They thought their\r\ngovernment wouldnâ\x80\x99t
    give vaccines to young children that had not been\r\nadequately tested. When their
    children were injured, some began\r\nresearching the vaccine and discovered their
    faith was misplaced. The\r\nexperience not only damaged trust in vaccination programs
    but the public\r\nhealth system more generally.\r\n\r\nSo where to now? For a
    start, every one of the reviewâ\x80\x99s recommendations\r\nshould be implemented.
    If time constraints associated with getting flu\r\nimmunisations to market mean
    safety and efficacy tests must continue\r\nafter vaccine administration starts,
    it is imperative our post-vaccine\r\nsurveillance systems provide rigorous, efficient,
    online and real-time\r\nmonitoring of the number and type of adverse events in
    relation to the\r\noverall number of doses given. It is also vital for parents
    to be\r\nadequately informed about the testing and safety of flu immunisation.\r\n\r\nWhat
    happened this year was not good enough. Not at all."
