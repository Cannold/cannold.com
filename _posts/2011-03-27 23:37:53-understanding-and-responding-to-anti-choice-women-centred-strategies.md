title: Understanding and Responding to Anti-Choice Women-centred Strategies
---
This paper discusses the rise and use of a ‘woman-centred’ anti-choice
strategy to oppose abortion in Australia and the USA. It argues that
this strategy seeks to imitate and exploit aspects of the pro-choice,
women-centred position on abortion. The strategy contends that women do
not really choose abortion but are pressured into it by others and then
experience a range of negative effects afterwards, including an
increased risk of breast cancer, infertility and post-abortion grief.
Rather than evaluate the truth of such claims, this paper seeks to
explicate from a feminist perspective the design, intent and
implications of this strategy and how it is being used in legislative
tactics, counselling, law suits and anti-choice activism. Such an
analysis is necessary for pro-choice efforts to respond effectively to
this new strategy, not only through literal rebuttals based on evidence,
but also through responses that counter its ideological power.
