  content: "In a Dick Smith store early last year, a 58-year-old woman made a silent
    protest. \"All the screens and sound systems were blaring. [The shop] was staffed
    by young men and I knew I was definitely never going to be served,\" posted \"Airdre
    Grant\" on the online news site The Hoopla.\r\n\r\n\"So I went around and turned
    off five TVs, six sound systems and four DVD players. I was quite blatant. I even
    turned off the flat-screen car-racing in the middle of the store . . . Can anyone
    beat this record[?] Don't worry about being 'caught'. No one will even know you
    are in the shop.\"\r\n\r\nGrant doesn't tell us whether she succeeded in attracting
    the attention of a sales assistant that day, but her post reveals her frustration
    at being consistently overlooked in shops as a mere result of her age.\r\n\r\nHer
    experience is just one example of the social phenomenon known as \"invisible women's
    syndrome\": a condition generally understood to affect women aged from about 45
    to 59 â\x80\x93 or 2.2 million Australians.\r\n\r\nReports from the gender wars
    suggest 50-plussers are the worst afflicted (post-retirement age is a whole other
    story) but that those as young as 40 suffer symptoms. And they hurt.\r\n\r\nYet
    for these \"Generation Jonesers\" â\x80\x93 those born between 1954 and 1965,
    wedged snugly between the baby boomers and Gen Xers â\x80\x93 there has, in so
    many respects, never been a better time to be 50. (Longer life expectancy and
    better access to both information and education are just a few benefits.)\r\n\r\nWe
    are all staying younger longer. Being 50 really does feel like 40. Very few of
    us look or act the way our parents did when they were 50.\r\n\r\nYet juggling
    work and family still takes its toll. And some women â\x80\x93 once their fertile
    years are behind them, and despite the gains of 40 years of feminism â\x80\x93
    feel marginalised. Invisible.\r\n\r\nWhile marriages may be lasting longer, according
    to the Bureau of Statistics, most people are still divorcing between the ages
    of 40 and 50.\r\n\r\n\"Women who have been 'having it all' come to us around 45,
    50 and they are clapped out,\" says Relationships Australia's director of operations,
    Lyn Fletcher.\r\n\r\n\"They've made themselves exhausted by being indispensable,
    rearing a family while forging a career, and they've lost something along the
    way. If they don't see themselves as important, it's easy to think of themselves
    as invisible.\"\r\n\r\nObserves a friend, who recently divorced: \"Everyone our
    age is working too hard. They're over-geared and they often have teenage children
    and ageing parents and a partner they're at least looking twice at out of narrowed
    eyes. No one has time to cook for 10 people any more, let alone set their friends
    up. We're opening a bottle of wine in front of the footy on Saturday night and
    saying, 'Cheers, I'm buggered.' \"\r\n\r\nAgeing, says feminist and ethicist Dr
    Leslie Cannold, \"makes women invisible, on the street and in the boardroom, and
    being invisible sucks\". A few years ago, Cannold outed herself as a Botox user
    in a newspaper column. She was arguing for an end to the hypocrisy and silence
    surrounding Botox compared to other age-defying treatments, such as dyeing hair
    and using make-up. She started having the anti-wrinkle injections to ease herself
    through the difficult, painful transition from the fertile, overtly sexual woman
    she had been to the still sexual but increasingly invisible woman she felt society,
    and men especially, viewed her as. \"I wasn't ready for it,\" she admits now.
    \"Whether, as feminists, we like it or not, men find us more attractive when we
    are fertile and able to reproduce, and this is of course transitory.\"\r\n\r\nBotox
    is seen in some feminist quarters as a test of one's soundness. It's a cosmetic
    procedure that has kept female actors working in their 40s, but few own up. Cannold
    has stopped the injections for now.\r\n\r\n\"I was buying myself some time to
    get used to my new situation. Time has gone on, I feel a little more ready to
    manage this stuff, but that's today. Maybe tomorrow I'll feel different.\r\n\r\n\"Some
    women say they like their invisibility; the gaze has gone, so they can get on
    with things under the radar. I wish I felt that â\x80\x93 I am pleased for them
    but also mystified.\"\r\n\r\nThere has been some high-profile discussion lately
    about the \"mature\" woman and the cultural isolation she experiences. The writer,
    director and actor Rachel Ward spoke publicly last year about her own struggle
    with invisible women's syndrome â\x80\x93 and if Ward is noticing it, something
    must be going on.\r\n\r\n\"Try climbing through higher education, motherhood,
    self-employment, years of self-improvement, gyms, diets, abstinence of everything
    enjoyable â\x80\x93 from ciggies to Magnums to suntans â\x80\x93 to selflessness,
    to finally reach the summit of womanhood, fit, exultant and ready to fly â\x80\x93
    to find . . . a generational wipeout,\" she ruminated in a column in The Sun-Herald.
    \"Visibility: zero. Scream 'Where the bloody hell are you?' all you like, but
    don't look to the movies, the media or airwaves because, aside from Gillard, Germaine
    on Adam Hills in Gordon St Tonight the other week, glimpses of Jenny Brockie and
    Jennifer Byrne, Kristin Scott Thomas and Juliette Binoche buried deep within the
    bowels of a French film festival, there's barely anyone out there who represents
    my age group.\" Ouch.\r\n\r\nIn 1979, Kathy Lette and her then-BFF Gabrielle Carey
    published their slyly subversive feminist novel, Puberty Blues, the book that
    spoke to a generation of women about being an invisible teenage girl in the 1970s.
    Last year's TV adaptation still made those women (now in their early 50s) cringe
    and laugh and get tight knots in their stomach as they recognised their younger
    selves.\r\n\r\nLette is a highly visible woman, a successful writer who has never
    stopped taking the piss and skewering societal hypocrisy, usually at the same
    time. But she doesn't buy the line that cosmetic surgery is simply another choice
    women are free to make.\r\n\r\nRather, she argues, it's being foisted on them
    because the alternative (women with faces and bodies to match their age) inevitably
    renders them invisible.\r\n\r\n\"Age to women is what Kryptonite is to Superman,\"
    she says. \"Inside every older woman is a younger woman screaming, 'Get me the
    hell outta here.'\r\n\r\n\"If we weren't invisible, if we saw normal-looking women
    over 50 on television and in movies (not playing grandmas), then perhaps women
    would feel more confident about saying 'no' to cosmetic surgery.\r\n\r\n\"I may
    have lines on my face but, hey, read between them â\x80\x93 there it all is, the
    babies, the books, the broken hearts, the hours of fun-loving foreplay.\" The
    minute a woman of a certain age sticks her head above the parapet, opprobrium
    rains down on her. Madonna, almost halfway through her sixth decade, has attracted
    particularly snarly flak for the crime of daring to think she is still hot â\x80\x93
    and worse, flaunting it.\r\n\r\nI conducted my own small survey, sending an email
    to 25 women aged 40-plus, three-quarters of whom are in relationships and all
    of whom work. My questions ranged from \"Do you lie about your age?\" (most do,
    especially on their CVs), through to \"Do you see any evidence in your personal
    or professional life that you are becoming less visible as you approach 50?\"\r\n\r\nThe
    responses poured in and revealed a complex mix of contradictory feelings. Some
    said they'd never felt more confident sexually, but others felt a youth-obsessed
    society made them feel like a sexual and cultural desert. One single woman sent
    a one-line response to the questions: \"Too painful to answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I recently
    lost my job working in the aged-care sector at a relatively senior level,\" wrote
    Liz, 48. \"It may be that turning 50 [soon] is coincidental, but when I applied
    for another job where I met all the criteria, I didn't even get an interview.
    I [just] dyed my hair back to blonde.\"\r\n\r\nRachael, 50, wrote: \"Retail experiences
    are the times when I feel most invisible, particularly in fashion outlets and
    department stores where, often, the younger sales people completely ignore you.\"\r\n\r\nClaudia,
    52: \"I'm invisible to everyone else except, of course, other women my age: they
    are definitely paying attention. There's a kind of verbal shorthand that occurs
    between my friends, where we know what we're thinking and feeling, but it's like
    we're speaking another language when we try to explain this deep sense of relevance
    deprivation to anyone else â\x80\x93 husbands included.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure
    I'm less visible, but I am treated differently,\" says 46-year-old Kim, who, at
    40, made the decision to stop dyeing her hair because she wanted to start feeling
    comfortable with the \"real\" her. For some of her friends, this was deemed tantamount
    to an act of lunacy.\r\n\r\n\"One screamed at me, 'Your husband will run off with
    a younger woman if you do that,' \" Kim recalls. \"I went on a rant about our
    relationship being more than that but, inside, I was shattered.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this
    from Eliza, 51: \"People don't see you as a sexual being any more.\r\n\r\nI don't
    mind that, we need to get over it at some stage. That said, being an attractive
    woman in a business environment can be helpful if you want to get in the ear of
    a male who is influential. Otherwise as a woman you have to be three times better
    to attain the same position.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I'm out at the theatre or at book
    club,\" says Sarah, a woman with a great job and partner who adores her (but also
    tells her that the blokes who pick up her single female mates refer to this Friday-night
    sport as \"granny-grabbing\"), \"I find myself comparing myself with the other
    women and wondering if I look as old/invisible as they do.\"\r\n\r\nWomen, it
    seems, are not beyond making their own judgments about what makes other women
    invisible. And it's usually around looks.\r\n\r\nThere is a highly successful
    ad on TV for car insurance that is predicated on the assumption that middle-aged
    women are susceptible to flattery that at best is kind. You know the one; Rhonda,
    the sweet but deluded woman living it up in Bali, who is so gormless that she
    is flattered by the attentions of the much younger, hunky Ketut. It's become a
    mini cultural phenomenon, with websites devoted to serious discourse on its possible
    colonial overtones, or barely disguised racism, or the urgent question as to whether
    Rhonda and Ketut are going to get it on.\r\n\r\nA quick ring-around of my friends
    confirms my thoughts. Rhonda is dreaming; that's the joke. She has to take a cheap
    holiday to get noticed.\r\n\r\nAs another friend said, the ABC and SBS have a
    higher quota of women over 40 who are smart and come in all shapes and sizes,
    \"but the commercial networks are appalling. I don't want to be represented by
    effing Melissa Doyle!\"\r\n\r\nThe invisibility phenomenon couldn't come at a
    worse time. \"The costs of compromises made to manage work and family . . . are
    coming home to roost,\" Cannold says. \"That we aren't going to get as far, soar
    as high, achieve as much as we planned, is a bitter enough pill to swallow. Losing
    our youth at the same time, and the potential for the second chances and happier
    endings it conjures, only rubs salt in the wound.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1986, a now infamous
    Newsweek article declared that a single, college-educated, 40-year-old woman was
    more likely to die in a terrorist attack than walk down the aisle. The Sydney
    psychologist John Aiken says the man-drought myth continues to create a lot of
    panic among women over 40, and it keeps some in bad relationships and sends many
    others through his door.\r\n\r\nAccording to RSVP.com (owned by Fairfax Media),
    Australia's busiest online dating site, the two fastest-growing age groups in
    the online dating market are the over-50s and the under-30s.\r\n\r\n\"Women who
    are 50-plus are quite clear that they're not looking to replicate what they had
    in a previous relationship,\" says Glenis Carroll, RSVP's general manager. \"They're
    less worried about looks and jobs; they don't want to give up what they've got;
    and they select a much narrower age pool than 50-year-old men. In other words,
    they're realistic.\"\r\n\r\nI sent a different set of questions on the theme of
    \"invisible women\" to 25 men aged 45-plus. Initially, the silence was deafening.
    An old boyfriend suggested I pull my head in. Apparently, expecting them to give
    honest answers to questions about whether age is a factor when it comes to female
    sex appeal or â\x80\x93 just as controversially â\x80\x93 whether, if they were
    to start a new relationship, they would prefer it to be with a woman younger than
    themselves, was a bit much.\r\n\r\n\"If any of them say they are equally attracted
    to a woman of 50 as a woman of 30, they're lying,\" another said. \"Younger people
    have more life to them â\x80\x93 we're all getting tired,\" wrote Richard, 49.
    \"That's not to say that older women aren't sexually appealing.\r\n\r\n\"Some
    are, but take 20 random women in their 30s and 20 random women in their 50s and
    ask a man which group is more sexually attractive to him and he'll say, 'Why are
    you asking? Isn't it obvious?' \"\r\n\r\nThen more emails arrived.\r\n\r\nThe
    most common response was along the lines of, \"Isn't this universal? Don't we
    all feel increasingly invisible as we age?\"\r\n\r\nHere's Paul, 49: \"There is
    the potential for a much deeper and more satisfying appeal with a woman over 50.
    They are emotionally mature, more certain of what they want, and probably more
    experienced in the give and take of the broader [aspects] of a relationship, but
    any man who pretends that the idea of a physical relationship with a younger woman
    is not appealing is not being honest with you (or themselves).\r\n\r\n\"The mere
    idea that a younger woman might find you attractive is immensely flattering.\"\r\n\r\nThere's
    certainly nothing invisible about the thousands of middle-aged Lycra-wearing blokes
    who've abandoned golf and a beer back at the clubhouse on Saturday mornings for
    bike-riding and a latte. What makes them pedal so hard? \"Pure fear,\" says a
    51-year-old male colleague who looks about a decade younger.\r\n\r\nBut men at
    50 are not invisible; they still hold the reins of power when it comes to deciding
    who we see projected back at us through media. The boardrooms of Australia are
    dominated by balding men in suits who are regarded as peaking professionally in
    their 50s.\r\n\r\nAs one female friend, an executive with an ASX 200 company,
    told me bluntly: \"A man's midlife crisis too often amounts to their search for
    their soulmate, who usually happens to be 30, leaving behind their 50-year-old
    wife and kids.\r\n\r\n\"If I read one more story about some old coot extolling
    the virtues of being a father again at 60, I will puke.\"\r\n\r\nOne could never
    accuse Wendy Harmer, 56, of being invisible.\r\n\r\nThe successful author, comedian,
    broadcaster and mother is outspoken on the issue of middle-age invisibility. Last
    year, she and her business partner, Jane Waterhouse, launched The Hoopla, an online
    news site which caters unashamedly for 40-plus women. The site is full of stories
    and opinion pieces on current affairs written by the likes of Jean Kittson, Corinne
    Grant and Tracey Spicer.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't see your face in advertisements
    [and] on TV, or hear your voice on the radio, it's not that one is invisible,
    but one feels invisible,\" Harmer says.\r\n\r\nIn the past few years, she and
    former ABC radio broadcaster Angela Catterns filled in on Sydney ABC 702's early-morning
    slot during the summer holidays, calling themselves the \"early girlies\". They
    were upfront about their age, but their shtick was to come across as bemused and
    middle-aged, not grumpy old women. Despite the program's popularity, they didn't
    receive a single offer to replicate the success anywhere else on radio. \"One
    senior radio executive told me men didn't want to hear one woman talking on the
    radio, let alone two,\" Harmer says.\r\n\r\nTrying to convince media companies
    and, in particular, 20-something men in advertising agencies that it's worth spending
    their dollars on a website whose users are middle-aged women or older is tough.\r\n\r\n\"Eyes
    glaze over in meetings when I mention the F [for \"fifty\"] word, so I tend to
    say 39 now when I'm describing [the age of] our market,\" Waterhouse says. \"They
    don't automatically get that there is this huge, highly educated, financially
    independent category of women who are buying houses, cars, insurance and who are
    travelling, and that they are missing out big-time by ignoring them.\" The pair
    say The Hoopla attracts 40,000 to 60,000 unique browsers monthly.\r\n\r\nThe University
    of NSW journalism professor Catharine Lumby definitely does not feel invisible,
    and she says women should stop being coy about their age. \"I've been told on
    a number of occasions that I should stop being so honest about my age â\x80\x93
    50,\" she says. \"I even had a very smart and attractive colleague who refused
    to confirm when she was turning 40. The best way to refute the invisibility nonsense
    is to be upfront and out there as women, proudly and loudly proclaiming that we
    may be ageing, but we're not going anywhere soon.\r\n\r\n\"When I turn 60, I'm
    going to invite all my friends to a pool party. Bikinis will be optional â\x80\x93
    but I've got a brand new one in my top drawer just in case.\""

    wrote Liz, 48. &ldquo;It may be that turning 50 [soon] is coincidental, but when

    friends, this was deemed tantamount to an act of lunacy.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;One

    an attractive woman in a business environment can be helpful if you want to get

    times better to attain the same position.\"</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m out
    at the theatre or at book club,&rdquo; says Sarah, a woman with a great job and
    partner who adores her (but also tells her that the blokes who pick up her single
    female mates refer to this Friday-night sport as &ldquo;granny-grabbing&rdquo;),
    &ldquo;I find myself comparing myself with the other women and wondering if I
    look as old/invisible as they do.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Women, it seems, are not beyond
    making their own judgments about what makes other women invisible. And it&rsquo;s
    usually around looks.</p>\n\n<p>There is a highly successful ad on TV for car
    insurance that is predicated on the assumption that middle-aged women are susceptible
    to flattery that at best is kind. You know the one; Rhonda, the sweet but deluded
    woman living it up in Bali, who is so gormless that she is flattered by the attentions
    of the much younger, hunky Ketut. It&rsquo;s become a mini cultural phenomenon,
    with websites devoted to serious discourse on its possible colonial overtones,
    or barely disguised racism, or the urgent question as to whether Rhonda and Ketut
    are going to get it on.</p>\n\n<p>A quick ring-around of my friends confirms my
    thoughts. Rhonda is dreaming; that&rsquo;s the joke. She has to take a cheap holiday
    to get noticed.</p>\n\n<p>As another friend said, the ABC and SBS have a higher
    quota of women over 40 who are smart and come in all shapes and sizes, &ldquo;but
    the commercial networks are appalling. I don&rsquo;t want to be represented by
    effing Melissa Doyle!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The invisibility phenomenon couldn&rsquo;t
    come at a worse time. &ldquo;The costs of compromises made to manage work and
    family &hellip; are coming home to roost,&rdquo; Cannold says. &ldquo;That we
    aren&rsquo;t going to get as far, soar as high, achieve as much as we planned,
    is a bitter enough pill to swallow. Losing our youth at the same time, and the
    potential for the second chances and happier endings it conjures, only rubs salt
    in the wound.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>In 1986, a now infamous Newsweek article declared
    that a single, college-educated, 40-year-old woman was more likely to die in a
    terrorist attack than walk down the aisle. The Sydney psychologist John Aiken
    says the man-drought myth continues to create a lot of panic among women over
    40, and it keeps some in bad relationships and sends many others through his door.</p>\n\n<p>According
    to RSVP.com (owned by Fairfax Media), Australia&rsquo;s busiest online dating
    site, the two fastest-growing age groups in the online dating market are the over-50s
    and the under-30s.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Women who are 50-plus are quite clear that
    they&rsquo;re not looking to replicate what they had in a previous relationship,&rdquo;
    says Glenis Carroll, RSVP&rsquo;s general manager. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re less worried
    about looks and jobs; they don&rsquo;t want to give up what they&rsquo;ve got;
    and they select a much narrower age pool than 50-year-old men. In other words,
    they&rsquo;re realistic.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I sent a different set of questions
    on the theme of &ldquo;invisible women&rdquo; to 25 men aged 45-plus. Initially,
    the silence was deafening. An old boyfriend suggested I pull my head in. Apparently,
    expecting them to give honest answers to questions about whether age is a factor
    when it comes to female sex appeal or â\x80\x93 just as controversially â\x80\x93
    whether, if they were to start a new relationship, they would prefer it to be
    with a woman younger than themselves, was a bit much.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;If any
    of them say they are equally attracted to a woman of 50 as a woman of 30, they&rsquo;re
    lying,&rdquo; another said. &ldquo;Younger people have more life to them â\x80\x93
    we&rsquo;re all getting tired,&rdquo; wrote Richard, 49. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not
    to say that older women aren&rsquo;t sexually appealing.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Some
    are, but take 20 random women in their 30s and 20 random women in their 50s and
    ask a man which group is more sexually attractive to him and he&rsquo;ll say,
    &lsquo;Why are you asking? Isn&rsquo;t it obvious?&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Then
    more emails arrived.</p>\n\n<p>The most common response was along the lines of,
    &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this universal? Don&rsquo;t we all feel increasingly invisible
    as we age?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s Paul, 49: &ldquo;There is the potential
    for a much deeper and more satisfying appeal with a woman over 50. They are emotionally
    mature, more certain of what they want, and probably more experienced in the give
    and take of the broader [aspects] of a relationship, but any man who pretends
    that the idea of a physical relationship with a younger woman is not appealing
    is not being honest with you (or themselves).</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The mere idea that
    a younger woman might find you attractive is immensely flattering.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s
    certainly nothing invisible about the thousands of middle-aged Lycra-wearing blokes
    who&rsquo;ve abandoned golf and a beer back at the clubhouse on Saturday mornings
    for bike-riding and a latte. What makes them pedal so hard? &ldquo;Pure fear,&rdquo;
    says a 51-year-old male colleague who looks about a decade younger.</p>\n\n<p>But
    men at 50 are not invisible; they still hold the reins of power when it comes
    to deciding who we see projected back at us through media. The boardrooms of Australia
    are dominated by balding men in suits who are regarded as peaking professionally
    in their 50s.</p>\n\n<p>As one female friend, an executive with an ASX 200 company,
    told me bluntly: &ldquo;A man&rsquo;s midlife crisis too often amounts to their
    search for their soulmate, who usually happens to be 30, leaving behind their
    50-year-old wife and kids.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;If I read one more story about some
    old coot extolling the virtues of being a father again at 60, I will puke.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>One
    could never accuse Wendy Harmer, 56, of being invisible.</p>\n\n<p>The successful
    author, comedian, broadcaster and mother is outspoken on the issue of middle-age
    invisibility. Last year, she and her business partner, Jane Waterhouse, launched
    The Hoopla, an online news site which caters unashamedly for 40-plus women. The
    site is full of stories and opinion pieces on current affairs written by the likes
    of Jean Kittson, Corinne Grant and Tracey Spicer.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t
    see your face in advertisements [and] on TV, or hear your voice on the radio,
    it&rsquo;s not that one is invisible, but one feels invisible,&rdquo; Harmer says.</p>\n\n<p>In
    the past few years, she and former ABC radio broadcaster Angela Catterns filled
    in on Sydney ABC 702&rsquo;s early-morning slot during the summer holidays, calling
    themselves the &ldquo;early girlies&rdquo;. They were upfront about their age,
    but their shtick was to come across as bemused and middle-aged, not grumpy old
    women. Despite the program&rsquo;s popularity, they didn&rsquo;t receive a single
    offer to replicate the success anywhere else on radio. &ldquo;One senior radio
    executive told me men didn&rsquo;t want to hear one woman talking on the radio,
    let alone two,&rdquo; Harmer says.</p>\n\n<p>Trying to convince media companies
    and, in particular, 20-something men in advertising agencies that it&rsquo;s worth
    spending their dollars on a website whose users are middle-aged women or older
    is tough.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Eyes glaze over in meetings when I mention the F [for
    \"fifty&rdquo;] word, so I tend to say 39 now when I&rsquo;m describing [the age
    of] our market,&ldquo; Waterhouse says. \"They don&rsquo;t automatically get that
    there is this huge, highly educated, financially independent category of women
    who are buying houses, cars, insurance and who are travelling, and that they are
    missing out big-time by ignoring them.&rdquo; The pair say The Hoopla attracts
    40,000 to 60,000 unique browsers monthly.</p>\n\n<p>The University of NSW journalism
    professor Catharine Lumby definitely does not feel invisible, and she says women
    should stop being coy about their age. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been told on a number
    of occasions that I should stop being so honest about my age â\x80\x93 50,&rdquo;
    she says. &ldquo;I even had a very smart and attractive colleague who refused
    to confirm when she was turning 40. The best way to refute the invisibility nonsense
    is to be upfront and out there as women, proudly and loudly proclaiming that we
    may be ageing, but we&rsquo;re not going anywhere soon.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;When
    I turn 60, I&rsquo;m going to invite all my friends to a pool party. Bikinis will
    be optional â\x80\x93 but I&rsquo;ve got a brand new one in my top drawer just
    in case.&rdquo;</p>\n"

title: 'Leslie on Why 40+ Women are Less Visible (and we don&#x27;t like it) '
--- "In a Dick Smith store early last year, a 58-year-old woman made a silent protest.
  \"All the screens and sound systems were blaring. [The shop] was staffed by young
  men and I knew I was definitely never going to be served,\" posted \"Airdre Grant\"
  on the online news site The Hoopla.\r\n\r\n\"So I went around and turned off five
  TVs, six sound systems and four DVD players. I was quite blatant. I even turned
  off the flat-screen car-racing in the middle of the store . . . Can anyone beat
  this record[?] Don't worry about being 'caught'. No one will even know you are in
  the shop.\"\r\n\r\nGrant doesn't tell us whether she succeeded in attracting the
  attention of a sales assistant that day, but her post reveals her frustration at
  being consistently overlooked in shops as a mere result of her age.\r\n\r\nHer experience
  is just one example of the social phenomenon known as \"invisible women's syndrome\":
  a condition generally understood to affect women aged from about 45 to 59 â\x80\x93
  or 2.2 million Australians.\r\n\r\nReports from the gender wars suggest 50-plussers
  are the worst afflicted (post-retirement age is a whole other story) but that those
  as young as 40 suffer symptoms. And they hurt.\r\n\r\nYet for these \"Generation
  Jonesers\" â\x80\x93 those born between 1954 and 1965, wedged snugly between the
  baby boomers and Gen Xers â\x80\x93 there has, in so many respects, never been a
  better time to be 50. (Longer life expectancy and better access to both information
  and education are just a few benefits.)\r\n\r\nWe are all staying younger longer.
  Being 50 really does feel like 40. Very few of us look or act the way our parents
  did when they were 50.\r\n\r\nYet juggling work and family still takes its toll.
  And some women â\x80\x93 once their fertile years are behind them, and despite the
  gains of 40 years of feminism â\x80\x93 feel marginalised. Invisible.\r\n\r\nWhile
  marriages may be lasting longer, according to the Bureau of Statistics, most people
  are still divorcing between the ages of 40 and 50.\r\n\r\n\"Women who have been
  'having it all' come to us around 45, 50 and they are clapped out,\" says Relationships
  Australia's director of operations, Lyn Fletcher.\r\n\r\n\"They've made themselves
  exhausted by being indispensable, rearing a family while forging a career, and they've
  lost something along the way. If they don't see themselves as important, it's easy
  to think of themselves as invisible.\"\r\n\r\nObserves a friend, who recently divorced:
  \"Everyone our age is working too hard. They're over-geared and they often have
  teenage children and ageing parents and a partner they're at least looking twice
  at out of narrowed eyes. No one has time to cook for 10 people any more, let alone
  set their friends up. We're opening a bottle of wine in front of the footy on Saturday
  night and saying, 'Cheers, I'm buggered.' \"\r\n\r\nAgeing, says feminist and ethicist
  Dr Leslie Cannold, \"makes women invisible, on the street and in the boardroom,
  and being invisible sucks\". A few years ago, Cannold outed herself as a Botox user
  in a newspaper column. She was arguing for an end to the hypocrisy and silence surrounding
  Botox compared to other age-defying treatments, such as dyeing hair and using make-up.
  She started having the anti-wrinkle injections to ease herself through the difficult,
  painful transition from the fertile, overtly sexual woman she had been to the still
  sexual but increasingly invisible woman she felt society, and men especially, viewed
  her as. \"I wasn't ready for it,\" she admits now. \"Whether, as feminists, we like
  it or not, men find us more attractive when we are fertile and able to reproduce,
  and this is of course transitory.\"\r\n\r\nBotox is seen in some feminist quarters
  as a test of one's soundness. It's a cosmetic procedure that has kept female actors
  working in their 40s, but few own up. Cannold has stopped the injections for now.\r\n\r\n\"I
  was buying myself some time to get used to my new situation. Time has gone on, I
  feel a little more ready to manage this stuff, but that's today. Maybe tomorrow
  I'll feel different.\r\n\r\n\"Some women say they like their invisibility; the gaze
  has gone, so they can get on with things under the radar. I wish I felt that â\x80\x93
  I am pleased for them but also mystified.\"\r\n\r\nThere has been some high-profile
  discussion lately about the \"mature\" woman and the cultural isolation she experiences.
  The writer, director and actor Rachel Ward spoke publicly last year about her own
  struggle with invisible women's syndrome â\x80\x93 and if Ward is noticing it, something
  must be going on.\r\n\r\n\"Try climbing through higher education, motherhood, self-employment,
  years of self-improvement, gyms, diets, abstinence of everything enjoyable â\x80\x93
  from ciggies to Magnums to suntans â\x80\x93 to selflessness, to finally reach the
  summit of womanhood, fit, exultant and ready to fly â\x80\x93 to find . . . a generational
  wipeout,\" she ruminated in a column in The Sun-Herald. \"Visibility: zero. Scream
  'Where the bloody hell are you?' all you like, but don't look to the movies, the
  media or airwaves because, aside from Gillard, Germaine on Adam Hills in Gordon
  St Tonight the other week, glimpses of Jenny Brockie and Jennifer Byrne, Kristin
  Scott Thomas and Juliette Binoche buried deep within the bowels of a French film
  festival, there's barely anyone out there who represents my age group.\" Ouch.\r\n\r\nIn
  1979, Kathy Lette and her then-BFF Gabrielle Carey published their slyly subversive
  feminist novel, Puberty Blues, the book that spoke to a generation of women about
  being an invisible teenage girl in the 1970s. Last year's TV adaptation still made
  those women (now in their early 50s) cringe and laugh and get tight knots in their
  stomach as they recognised their younger selves.\r\n\r\nLette is a highly visible
  woman, a successful writer who has never stopped taking the piss and skewering societal
  hypocrisy, usually at the same time. But she doesn't buy the line that cosmetic
  surgery is simply another choice women are free to make.\r\n\r\nRather, she argues,
  it's being foisted on them because the alternative (women with faces and bodies
  to match their age) inevitably renders them invisible.\r\n\r\n\"Age to women is
  what Kryptonite is to Superman,\" she says. \"Inside every older woman is a younger
  woman screaming, 'Get me the hell outta here.'\r\n\r\n\"If we weren't invisible,
  if we saw normal-looking women over 50 on television and in movies (not playing
  grandmas), then perhaps women would feel more confident about saying 'no' to cosmetic
  surgery.\r\n\r\n\"I may have lines on my face but, hey, read between them â\x80\x93
  there it all is, the babies, the books, the broken hearts, the hours of fun-loving
  foreplay.\" The minute a woman of a certain age sticks her head above the parapet,
  opprobrium rains down on her. Madonna, almost halfway through her sixth decade,
  has attracted particularly snarly flak for the crime of daring to think she is still
  hot â\x80\x93 and worse, flaunting it.\r\n\r\nI conducted my own small survey, sending
  an email to 25 women aged 40-plus, three-quarters of whom are in relationships and
  all of whom work. My questions ranged from \"Do you lie about your age?\" (most
  do, especially on their CVs), through to \"Do you see any evidence in your personal
  or professional life that you are becoming less visible as you approach 50?\"\r\n\r\nThe
  responses poured in and revealed a complex mix of contradictory feelings. Some said
  they'd never felt more confident sexually, but others felt a youth-obsessed society
  made them feel like a sexual and cultural desert. One single woman sent a one-line
  response to the questions: \"Too painful to answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I recently lost my
  job working in the aged-care sector at a relatively senior level,\" wrote Liz, 48.
  \"It may be that turning 50 [soon] is coincidental, but when I applied for another
  job where I met all the criteria, I didn't even get an interview. I [just] dyed
  my hair back to blonde.\"\r\n\r\nRachael, 50, wrote: \"Retail experiences are the

  40, made the decision to stop dyeing her hair because she wanted to start feeling
  comfortable with the \"real\" her. For some of her friends, this was deemed tantamount
  to an act of lunacy.\r\n\r\n\"One screamed at me, 'Your husband will run off with
  a younger woman if you do that,' \" Kim recalls. \"I went on a rant about our relationship
  being more than that but, inside, I was shattered.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this from Eliza,
  51: \"People don't see you as a sexual being any more.\r\n\r\nI don't mind that,

  on.\r\n\r\nA quick ring-around of my friends confirms my thoughts. Rhonda is dreaming;
  that's the joke. She has to take a cheap holiday to get noticed.\r\n\r\nAs another
  friend said, the ABC and SBS have a higher quota of women over 40 who are smart
  and come in all shapes and sizes, \"but the commercial networks are appalling. I
  don't want to be represented by effing Melissa Doyle!\"\r\n\r\nThe invisibility
  phenomenon couldn't come at a worse time. \"The costs of compromises made to manage
  work and family . . . are coming home to roost,\" Cannold says. \"That we aren't

  read one more story about some old coot extolling the virtues of being a father
  again at 60, I will puke.\"\r\n\r\nOne could never accuse Wendy Harmer, 56, of being
  invisible.\r\n\r\nThe successful author, comedian, broadcaster and mother is outspoken
  on the issue of middle-age invisibility. Last year, she and her business partner,
  Jane Waterhouse, launched The Hoopla, an online news site which caters unashamedly
  for 40-plus women. The site is full of stories and opinion pieces on current affairs
  written by the likes of Jean Kittson, Corinne Grant and Tracey Spicer.\r\n\r\n\"If
  you don't see your face in advertisements [and] on TV, or hear your voice on the
  radio, it's not that one is invisible, but one feels invisible,\" Harmer says.\r\n\r\nIn
  the past few years, she and former ABC radio broadcaster Angela Catterns filled
  in on Sydney ABC 702's early-morning slot during the summer holidays, calling themselves
  the \"early girlies\". They were upfront about their age, but their shtick was to
  come across as bemused and middle-aged, not grumpy old women. Despite the program's
  popularity, they didn't receive a single offer to replicate the success anywhere
  else on radio. \"One senior radio executive told me men didn't want to hear one
  woman talking on the radio, let alone two,\" Harmer says.\r\n\r\nTrying to convince
  media companies and, in particular, 20-something men in advertising agencies that
  it's worth spending their dollars on a website whose users are middle-aged women
  or older is tough.\r\n\r\n\"Eyes glaze over in meetings when I mention the F [for
  \"fifty\"] word, so I tend to say 39 now when I'm describing [the age of] our market,\"
  Waterhouse says. \"They don't automatically get that there is this huge, highly
  educated, financially independent category of women who are buying houses, cars,
  insurance and who are travelling, and that they are missing out big-time by ignoring
  them.\" The pair say The Hoopla attracts 40,000 to 60,000 unique browsers monthly.\r\n\r\nThe
  University of NSW journalism professor Catharine Lumby definitely does not feel
  invisible, and she says women should stop being coy about their age. \"I've been
  told on a number of occasions that I should stop being so honest about my age â\x80\x93
  50,\" she says. \"I even had a very smart and attractive colleague who refused to
  confirm when she was turning 40. The best way to refute the invisibility nonsense
  is to be upfront and out there as women, proudly and loudly proclaiming that we
  may be ageing, but we're not going anywhere soon.\r\n\r\n\"When I turn 60, I'm going
  to invite all my friends to a pool party. Bikinis will be optional â\x80\x93 but
  I've got a brand new one in my top drawer just in case.\""
