    this week Senator Amanda Vanstone re-opened the euthanasia\r\ndebate by opining
    in a newspaper interview that it was inhumane to\r\ndeprive Australians of â\x80\x9Csane
    sensible and humane euthanasia lawsâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nThe arguments the palliative
    care movement make against euthanasia are\r\nsimilar to those made by the anti-choice
    movement against abortion. This\r\nis unsurprising , given the religious origins
    of both schools of though\r\nof late, both have taken what one scholar describes
    as a decidedly\r\nâ\x80\x9Csecular turnâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nBoth movements argue
    that the only reason why those they claim to\r\nrepresent - women and terminally
    ill patients - choose as they do is\r\nbecause both groups lack adequate knowledge
    of other alternatives. If\r\nonly woman knew about Centrelink parenting payments,
    and the terminally\r\nill recognised the improvements in pain management, the
    demand for\r\nabortion and physician assisted suicide would disappear.\r\n\r\nBoth
    movements also question the decision-making competence of those\r\nchoosing abortion
    and physician-assisted suicide. Female pregnancy\r\nhormones and the poor physical
    and mental health status of terminally\r\nill patients, not to mention the stress
    of crisis decision-making, are\r\ndeemed legitimate reasons to doubt the rationality
    - and disregard the\r\nchoices - of those pursuing control over their bodies and
    their deaths.\r\nPalliative care providers, argues a recent article in Palliative\r\nMedicine,
    deem all patients who â\x80\x9Cthink that their life is irretrievably\r\nbadâ\x80\x9D
    to be â\x80\x9Cwrongâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nFinally, both advocacy groups suggest that
    the availability of more\r\noptions has the counter-intuitive outcome of reducing
    choice. The mere\r\navailability of abortion and physician-assisted suicide, the
    argument\r\nruns, coerces women and terminally ill-patients to â\x80\x9Cchoose
    itâ\x80\x9D so as to\r\navoid burdening others with their need. Real choice, it
    is claimed,\r\nrequires the continued criminalisation of abortion and\r\nphysician-assisted
    suicide so that more legitimate options like adoption\r\nand palliative care can
    flourish.\r\n\r\nSo what is the truth? Surveys across the western world, including\r\nAustralia,
    clearly show support for a right to die. A 2002 Gallup poll\r\nfound 72% of Americans
    supported doctor-assisted suicide for those with\r\nterminal illnesses, while
    in the same year 70% of Australians were found\r\nto be in favour of giving terminally
    ill and severely suffering people a\r\nchoice about the timing and method of their
    death.\r\n\r\nData from Oregon suggests that the most frequently given reasons
    for\r\nchoosing physician-assisted suicide by the approximately 30 people who\r\ndie
    this way every year are loss of autonomy\" (87%), â\x80\x9Closs of dignityâ\x80\x9D\r\n(80%)
    and â\x80\x9Closs of the ability to enjoy the activities that make life\r\nworth
    livingâ\x80\x9D (84%). This data, which suggests that mental rather than\r\nphysical
    suffering is the main driver of decisions to die, undermines\r\nthe assertion
    of anti-euthanasia forces that the effectiveness of\r\nmodern-day palliative methods
    obviates the need for legal reform.\r\n\r\nSuch figures also undercut claims that
    the legal freedom to die would\r\nexert the greatest coercive pressure on those
    lacking options other than\r\ndeath: namely, the ill-educated and those too poor
    to afford palliative\r\ncare. The overwhelming majority of Oregonians seeking
    physician-assisted\r\nsuicide were highly educated and well off. Indeed, 86% were
    enrolled in\r\nhospice care at the time of their suicides, while only 2 of the
    208\r\npeople who have used the legislation so far were uninsured.\r\n\r\nThere
    are some values that palliative care and right to die advocates\r\nshare. These
    include a belief in the importance of reducing human\r\nsuffering and a distaste
    for the over-medicalisation of the dying\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nHowever, disagreements
    between the two groups are profound. They include\r\ntheoretical disputes about
    the legitimacy of death as a choice as well\r\nas more empirically-based spats
    about the competence and capacity of the\r\nterminally ill to make adequately
    informed decisions, and the likely\r\neffect of making physician-assisted suicide
    a legal choice. Palliative\r\ncare advocates see decriminalisation as an invitation
    to what Melbourne\r\nwriter Juliette Hughes (Opinion, 13/7) recently described
    as a culture\r\nof death that would enable the preferences of greedy relatives
    and\r\nstingy hospital bureaucrats to be privileged above those of vulnerable\r\npatients.
    In contrast, advocates for physician-assisted suicide believe\r\nsafeguards can
    be put in place to protect patient-autonomy and reduce\r\nthe risks of involuntary
    euthanasia: risks currently managed in\r\nsecretive and ad hoc ways. One survey
    found that while 30% of all\r\nAustralian deaths involving a medical decision
    designed to end the\r\npatientâ\x80\x99s life, only 4% of these decisions were
    in response to a direct\r\nrequest from the patient.\r\n\r\nSome Australians speed
    and drive drunk. Yet few would seriously moot the\r\ncriminalisation of driving
    as a solution to this undeniably serious\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nInstead, as we do
    to minimise the risk of irresponsible driving to self\r\nand others, we must move
    to enact sophisticated regulatory and\r\ncompliance regimes around end of life
    decisions. Ones that will offer\r\nthose of us who meet threshold conditions for
    competence to exercise our\r\nreason and our values when it comes to critical
    decisions about our\r\nbodies, our lives and our deaths."
