    plays a small part,\r\nSummers opined, but the rest of the problem could be slated
    home to\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99s natural mediocrity (their under-representation in the
    left tail\r\nof a bell curve measuring scientific and mathematical IQ), and their\r\nunwillingness
    to work hard.\r\n\r\nBut while has been his claims about female biology that have
    caused him\r\nso much grief, it was the Harvard Presidentâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9Chigh-powered
    jobâ\x80\x9D thesis\r\nthat really irked me.\r\n\r\nEssentially, it re-badges
    institutional gender inequity as the morally\r\nneutral consequences of womenâ\x80\x99s
    work and family â\x80\x9Cchoicesâ\x80\x9D. High-powered\r\njobs, says Summer,
    demand 80 hour weeks, time flexibility, continuous\r\nand diligent effort throughout
    the lifecycle and a mind that is â\x80\x9Calways\r\nworking on the problems that
    are in the job, even when the job is not\r\ntaking placeâ\x80\x9D. Married men,
    says Summers, have historically been more\r\nâ\x80\x9Cpreparedâ\x80\x9D to make
    this â\x80\x9Ccommitmentâ\x80\x9D than married women.\r\n\r\nThereâ\x80\x99s no
    doubt that the thesis that women (bless their deep and\r\nkarmically balanced
    souls) are â\x80\x9Copting outâ\x80\x9D of the rat race and\r\nâ\x80\x9Credefining
    successâ\x80\x9D - rather than bashing their heads against iron\r\nceilings -
    is extremely popular at the moment. A 2003 cover story in the\r\nNew York Times
    Magazine put the case this way. Beneath a photo of a\r\nmother and baby cuddling
    at the foot of a ladder, it asked â\x80\x9CWhy donâ\x80\x99t\r\nmore women get
    to the top?â\x80\x9D. The answer: â\x80\x9CThey choose not to.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nConvenient?
    Iâ\x80\x99ll say. But the trouble is that thereâ\x80\x99s no evidence that\r\nwhen
    mothers have real choice, they dump their plans to have the same\r\nâ\x80\x9Callâ\x80\x9D
    as men have always enjoyed and sedately file home. Instead, what\r\ndata there
    is suggests that when women do give up and accept life on the\r\nMummy-track,
    a lack of real options to balance work and family is the\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nThe
    key to all this is the contrast between what choice looks like in\r\nthe abstract,
    versus its appearance in the real world. In the abstract,\r\nunspoken and patently
    false presumptions about the full and fair context\r\nin which women make decisions
    about career and family lead to\r\ndisinterested conclusions that womenâ\x80\x99s
    failure to achieve is the\r\nconsequence of their work â\x80\x9Cchoicesâ\x80\x9D.
    In the real world, women know they\r\ncan only make authentic choices consistent
    with their needs and values\r\nwhen there is an adequate range of high quality
    options available, and\r\nthey are free to decide between them.\r\n\r\nHereâ\x80\x99s
    just some of what a 2004 US Government Accountability Office\r\nreport found when
    it asked women science students and academics why they\r\nworked at smaller institutions,
    taught more, and more often on a\r\npart-time basis: behaviour that they all knew
    significantly reduced\r\ntheir odds of successfully competing against the men
    in their department\r\nfor tenure.\r\n\r\nFirstly, most female PhD student said
    they intended to seek a position\r\nat a small college, where theyâ\x80\x99ll
    teach more and research less, in order\r\nto maintain a work family balance. Secondly,
    women said they worked\r\npart-time more often then men in order to juggle family
    life with a\r\ntenure track position. Thirdly, they complained that because they\r\nshoulder
    the bulk of the second shift at home but their male colleagues\r\ndonâ\x80\x99t,
    gender-neutral university assistance programs to parents - like\r\nan extra year
    after a baby is born to publish before a tenure decision\r\nis made - does nothing
    more than further advantage their male colleagues\r\nin the tenure competition
    at their expense.\r\n\r\nWhat all this, not to mention logic, suggests is that
    women â\x80\x9Cchooseâ\x80\x9D\r\ntheir health, sanity and the well-being of their
    children and their\r\nmarriage against their own career advancement in the same
    way animals\r\ncaught in steel trap traps â\x80\x9Cchooseâ\x80\x9D to gnaw of
    their legs.\r\n\r\nAnd when women arenâ\x80\x99t trapped? Anecdotal evidence (and
    thatâ\x80\x99s most of\r\nwhatâ\x80\x99s around, given the dearth of high-quality
    family-friendly\r\nemployment) suggests that they stay, excel, and achieve.\r\n\r\nIn
    fact, the only real chance of ever testing Summersâ\x80\x99 thesis about the\r\nrole
    biology plays in womenâ\x80\x99s work patterns is to eliminate the effect\r\ngender
    discrimination and bias has on them. Only when the playing field\r\nis truly level
    - both at home and at work - will we know whether men\r\nkeep rising to the top
