  content: "Madonna turns 50 this year. Like every wheeze and fart in the\r\nentertainerâ\x80\x99s
    life, this one is attracting comment. From some, it sounds\r\nlike this. â\x80\x9C50?
    She looks 30! If she really was a taboo-breaker, she\r\nwouldnâ\x80\x99t have
    smooth skin and pert breasts. Sheâ\x80\x99d be strutting her stuff\r\non the cover
    of Vanity Fair with a wrinkled d&eacute;colletage and baggy\r\narms hanging out.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nLike
    most discussions about ageing in contemporary Australia, this one\r\nis confused.
    On the one hand, baby-boomers canâ\x80\x99t stop telling us that 60\r\nis the
    new 50, that age-related discrimination is rife, and that no one\r\nshould have
    to give up what they do or love because others say theyâ\x80\x99re\r\ntoo old.
    Stay at work! Keep enjoying sex! Arise and go windsailing!\r\nHaving only just
    arrived in middle age I can tell you that exhortations\r\nto keep on keeping on
    are constant.\r\n\r\nBut donâ\x80\x99t attempt to match your youthful activities
    with youthful looks,\r\nor you will be condemned as unenlightened and vain. So
    what if employers\r\ndiscriminate against older workers or that invisibility for
    women beyond\r\na certain age is inevitable? Resistance by Botox or surgery is
    wrong,\r\nwrong, wrong. The upshot? Weâ\x80\x99re forbidden to act our age but
    required to\r\nlook it. Whereâ\x80\x99s the sense in that?\r\n\r\nWhich takes
    us back to the material girl. Yes, it would it have been\r\nradical for the bare
    arms emerging from Madonnaâ\x80\x99s body suit to have been\r\ndotted with hair-sprouting
    moles. Radical for cascading waves of\r\ncellulite to have been visible above
    her thigh-high black boots.\r\n\r\nBut does anyone really think this would have
    made middle age â\x80\x9Chotâ\x80\x9D? My\r\nguess is that such an appearance
    would have started a whisper campaign\r\nthat would have brought Madonnaâ\x80\x99s
    long-running reign as a cultural icon\r\nto a close. Poor Madonna, look at how
    old she looks. Poor Madonna, sheâ\x80\x99s\r\nlet herself go. Poor Madonna, canâ\x80\x99t
    she see sheâ\x80\x99s not beautiful any\r\nmore, and so no longer entitled to
    the power beautiful women wield?\r\n\r\nPitying Madonna. It gives me shivers to
    think about it.\r\n\r\nNo wonder she has refused to age gracefully. No wonder
    she resists not\r\njust in ways we approve (eating well, spending hours in the
    gym and at\r\ndance rehearsals) but in ways we donâ\x80\x99t (liquid and surgical
    lifts,\r\ntucks, peels and slathers). Resists received opinion about right and\r\nwrong,
    and the endless rules about how women should live their lives,\r\njust as she
    has always done.\r\n\r\nSo why are we so quick to judge? Madonna is reticent about
    her fitness\r\nand other age-retarding routines. She never promotes them as liberatory\r\nor
    feminist in any sense.\r\n\r\nI think itâ\x80\x99s envy and a desperate sense
    that we canâ\x80\x99t keep up. Madonna\r\nat 50 looks better than most of us at
    30, and this makes some of us feel\r\nlike failures. We could console ourselves
    with the fact she has a home\r\ngym, a personal trainer, nannies and a travelling
    chef to support her\r\nefforts, but instead we point the finger, and accuse her
    of letting us\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nI donâ\x80\x99t think she has and suspect that Nora
    Ephron would agree. Ephron,\r\nof When Harry met Sally fame, had this to say about
    ageing in a recent\r\nessay in American Vogue: â\x80\x9C[Some people say] itâ\x80\x99s
    great to be old. Itâ\x80\x99s\r\ngreat to be wise and sage and mellow; itâ\x80\x99s
    great to be at the point\r\nwhere you understand just what matters in life. I
    canâ\x80\x99t stand people who\r\nsay things like this.â\x80\x9D"
