    romantic union of choice with â\x80\x9Cthe oneâ\x80\x9D person able to meet\r\nour

    solid. Despite this, and often amid cries of â\x80\x9Cdonâ\x80\x99t go for\r\nsecond
    bestâ\x80\x9D and â\x80\x9Cyou deserve better,â\x80\x9D one or both partners will
    call it\r\nquits. In the aftermath, many will blame themselves for failing to
    be\r\nfor their partner, or to have found in them, their everything.\r\n\r\nBut
    are we failing at marriage, or is marriage failing us? If we stopped\r\nblaming
    ourselves for failing to suit marriage, and started asking why\r\nmarriage doesnâ\x80\x99t
    better suit us, would more of us stay together?\r\n\r\nI say, â\x80\x9Cyesâ\x80\x9D.
    Marriage was designed to serve a number of purposes, but\r\nmost relevant to 21st
    century Australians is that of raising children.\r\nResearch suggests that unless
    there is violence, children do better in\r\nintact families than divorced ones,
    even when parents fight. The reasons\r\nfor this are complex, but include the
    financial advantages of two-parent\r\nhouseholds, and the dramas caused by divorce,
    and parental dating and\r\nre-partnering which may distract children from focusing
    on - and parents\r\nfrom supporting - their project of growing up.\r\n\r\nWe all
    have needs, some of which reflect at the most fundamental level\r\nwho we are,
    what we value and what we require to flourish. For some,\r\nabandoning hope of
    having those needs met to maintain the marriage for\r\nthe childrenâ\x80\x99sâ\x80\x99
    sake seems desperately old-fashioned and unfair. And so\r\nthe divorce.\r\n\r\nThe
    alternative - rarely discussed - is to renegotiate the marriage\r\ncontract. Key

    to meet all the needs of both partners is\r\nthe fault of neither, but the result
    of the inflexible, impersonal and\r\nunrealistic demands of the institution of
    marriage itself.\r\n\r\nFor some, the freedom to negotiate the individual conditions
    required to\r\nsustain the relationship could save the relationship in the long-term,\r\nor
    at least until the kid leave home. While each individualised marital\r\ncontract
    will be different, mutual respect, attendance to parental\r\nobligations and the
    primacy of the marital relationship over\r\nextra-marital ones would be likely
    bottom-line conditions in most.\r\n\r\nIt may be that some people continue to
