  content: "Australians believe they ought to be ruled by laws, not by the arbitrary
    whims of whoever happens â\x80\x93 by might or right â\x80\x93 to wield power.
    \r\n\r\nWe believe those laws should govern the behaviour of all, whether we are
    a homeless derelict, a wealthy tycoon or the holder of high political office.
    \r\n\r\nWe respect what we call \"the rule of law\" and \"procedural fairness\"
    because these processes express one of the core values on which our nation was
    founded â\x80\x93 that of the fundamental equality between persons.\r\n\r\nWhat
    often goes unstated is that we both assume and expect judicial processes that
    are fair will deliver fair outcomes. This isn't always the case. Evidence gathered
    wrongly by police can see a serial paedophile freed on what the media tends to
    call a \"technicality\". Individuals deemed mentally unfit to stand trial might
    have committed extremely serious crimes they could well undertake again, should
    they be released into the community. Rape reporting and conviction rates are so
    low â\x80\x93 about 12.5 per cent, according to one recent study â\x80\x93 that
    Australian Supreme Court judge Marcia Neave recently admitted that \"the vast
    majority of true allegations [of sexual assault] do not result in any redress
    through the criminal justice system\".\r\n\r\nThe truth is that our justice system
    prefers a fair process to a fair outcome. In an ideal world we expect the two
    to go hand in hand but, when push comes to shove, Australian justice prefers a
    guilty person to walk free than an innocent wind up in jail.\r\n\r\nThis is how
    it should be but I do think we need to be careful about the way we describe cases
    that fall between the lines.\r\n\r\nIn 1959, Sandra Willson murdered an innocent
    stranger â\x80\x93 23-year-old uni student and part-time cab driver Rodney Woodgate.
    Willson confessed to the killing and described it in great detail in an unpublished
    manuscript. But because she was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial, she was
    detained at the governor's pleasure.\r\n\r\nAfter being declared sane, she needed
    the campaigning of activist group Women Behind Bars to secure her release. These
    activists did great work but listening to a radio program on the case recently,
    I flinched at their description of Willson as a \"victim\" and as \"not guilty\".\r\nThe
    latter characterisation, while technically correct, seems insufficiently nuanced
    and insensitive to Woodgate's family.\r\n\r\nThose aware of disconnects between
    fair process and fair outcome are also obliged to speak up. This is what Justice
    Neave was doing when she raised concerns at the failure of changes to rape trial
    proceedings designed to increase their fairness to victims to also deliver fair
    outcomes.\r\nInstead, Neave told a conference in Sydney, both guilty pleas and
    conviction rates appeared to be in free-fall, increasing the risk that those guilty
    of sexual offences will \"escape prosecution and offend against other victims\".\r\n\r\nThe
    answer, Justice Neave says, might be restorative justice conferences. There perpetrators
    admit or acknowledge guilt, hear the victim's pain and agree to reparations like
    a written apology or to undertake counselling.\r\n\r\nThis might work. Surveys
    of those involved in pilots of such programs find that upwards of 90 per cent
    of both victims and perpetrators judge them to be fair and substantial majorities
    feel the outcomes are just.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
