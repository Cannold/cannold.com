  content: "What moralities do Members of Parliament owe to the public and the public
    interest? How can these obligations be enforced? \n\nThis is not an idle wonder.
    It sprung into my mind like a many-headed hydra in the wake of comments by the
    newly declared the winner of the Lower House seat of Fairfax - the garrulous mining
    magnate and billionaire businessman, Clive Palmer.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia,
    Palmer owns Mineralogy, Waratah Coal, Queensland Nickel at Townsville, Palmer
    Coolum Resort on the Sunshine Coast, Palmer Sea Reef Golf Course at Port Douglas,
    Palmer Colonial Golf Course at Robina, and the Palmer Gold Coast Golf Course,
    also at Robina. He's got plans to work with CSC Jinling Shipyard to construct
    a replica of RMS Titanic in China.\n\nWhen a journalist asked Palmer about the
    potential for conflicts between his business leadership positions and his sworn
    duty to serve the public interest as an MP, he was dismissive:\n\n\"Well, that's
    just rubbish of course. As a Member of Parliament, you don't have a conflict of
    interest - only if you're a minister.\"\n\nPalmer is wrong. Members of parliament
    do experience conflicts of interest. Any parliamentarian who has material interests,
    friends and family or roles outside of the Parliament can find these conflicting
    with their sworn duty to serve the public.\n\nThere's no crime in having a conflict
    of interest. Indeed, it's a near certainty that those who serve the public interest
    are likely to find themselves facing an actual, potential or perceived conflict
    at some point.\n\nEthical issues only arise where the conflict is not acknowledged
    and properly managed. Ministers, MPs, judges, police officers, directors of public
    entities or members of public boards are among those who can find themselves faced
    with a conflict of interest or a conflict of duty. Once identified, they must
    act to protect the public either by removing themselves, restricting their involvement
    (for instance, participating in a debate but not a vote), relinquishing the interest
    giving rise to the conflict, or resigning from public office all together.\n\nPalmer's
    response to journalist questions on conflict suggested he wrongly believed that
    if he admitted the conflict, he'd be forced to limit or quit his new role. In
    fact, it is nearly always sufficient for a conflicted public official to remove
    him or herself from decision-making on the matter. For example, if the carbon
    tax is repealed retrospectively as Palmer has demanded of the Prime Minister,
    this would cancel Palmer's Queensland company Nickel's unpaid debt of $6.2 million
    to the Clean Energy Regulator. Palmer should remove himself from the debate and
    vote on the tax.\n\nBut sadly, Palmer is right about one thing - the absence of
    a legislated, enforceable code of conduct for Australian MPs and Senators. Indeed,
    even the Ministerial Code he believes has sway is informal, carrying neither the
    force of law or regulation. It's also unenforceable and able to be altered, amended,
    interpreted or eliminated by the Prime Minister of the day.\n\nThis is not to
    say that Parliament doesn't deploy any means of managing the actual, potential
    and perceived conflicts of its members. It does through an interest register that
    lists parliamentarians' pecuniary, occupational and other interests.\n\nFaced
    with someone like Palmer, it's hard to see that this will be enough. Such registers
    work on the belief that sunlight is the best disinfectant, and all that is necessary
    to deter MPs from deploying their influence in matters where they are conflicted
    is the knowledge that they could be named and shamed. But disclosure it no deterrent
    if those being exposed to public scrutiny are convinced they should be exempt
    from the rules governing others, or that they have done nothing wrong.\n\nThe
    truth is that vigilance and disclosure is a necessary but insufficient step to
    ensure those we elect are serving our interests, not their own. Withdrawal from
    key debates and votes may also be necessary to manage conflicts. Passing a law
    that guarantees vigilance and effective management of conflicts, rather than leaving
    it up to MPs to comprehend and manage the issue themselves, would be the first
    step of a parliament truly accountable to the public."
