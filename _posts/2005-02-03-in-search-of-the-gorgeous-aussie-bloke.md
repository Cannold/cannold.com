    not forget men.\r\n\r\nSomeone had to do it. And I figured, it might as well be
    me. In the\r\nlong-running debate about Australiaâ\x80\x99s fertility debate,
    someone had to\r\npoint out that baby-making and baby-raising is not a solitary
    business.\r\nThis means that it simply doesnâ\x80\x99t make sense to keep pointing
    the finger\r\nof blame for Australiaâ\x80\x99s low birth rate at women alone.\r\n\r\nAs
    I argue in my new book â\x80\x9CWhat, No Baby: why women have lost the\r\nfreedom
    to mother and how they can get it backâ\x80\x9D (extracted in Good\r\nWeekend
    22/1), there is little question that menâ\x80\x99s desire and decisions\r\nimpact
    significantly on whether women who desire children actually wind\r\nup mothers.
    The truth is men can derail womenâ\x80\x99s maternity plans by\r\nfailing to partner,
    failing to prove themselves good father material or\r\nsimply refusing to have
    the kids that they promised their spouse years\r\nearlier they would want â\x80\x9Cone
    dayâ\x80\x9D. Such problems, among others, are why\r\nit just doesnâ\x80\x99t
    make sense to leave men out of discussions about the\r\nwhys and wherefores of
    Australiaâ\x80\x99s low birthrates.\r\n\r\nBut I know there are Australian men
    who have the incomes and credentials\r\nto be part of the problem, but have chosen
    instead to be part of the\r\nsolution. That single men exist who are willing to
    commit to women they\r\nlove within a reasonable time frame or when an unplanned
    pregnancy\r\nintrudes on well-laid plans. Men who, the moment they realise they
    are\r\nâ\x80\x9Cjust not that intoâ\x80\x9D the maternity-yearning woman beside
    them, let her\r\nknow so she can find someone who is. I realise that the nation
    has\r\nplenty of men willing to put aside their own anxieties about career and\r\nmoney
    - and ignore the fact that physiologically they still have time -\r\nso they can
    say â\x80\x9Cyesâ\x80\x9D to partners who want to get pregnant while they\r\nare
    still young.\r\n\r\nI call such blokes â\x80\x9Cthe gorgeous menâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nIn
    fact, not only have men been wrongly excluded from discussions about\r\nAustraliaâ\x80\x99s
    low fertility, but notions of â\x80\x9Cchoiceâ\x80\x9D have been promulgated\r\nthat
    palpably lack the sophistication to accurately describe what women\r\ndo when
    they decide against kids. To put it simply, women donâ\x80\x99t always\r\ndo what
    they choose to do. In particular, my research makes clear that\r\nwhile the vast
    majority of women want to mother, their freedom to choose\r\nchildren at any particular
    point is shaped and limited by a range of\r\nsocial circumstances and attitudes.\r\n\r\nIt
    would be both unfair and illogical of me to claim that while womenâ\x80\x99s\r\ndecisions
    about children are constrained by social attitudes and\r\nstructures, men behave
    as they do because they are naturally rotten to\r\nthe core. Instead, I have sought
    to examine not just what men do when it\r\ncomes to partnering and parenthood,
    but what they want to do and would,\r\nif they were really free to choose.\r\n\r\nNot
    surprisingly, there are plenty of reasons for male hesitation when\r\nit comes
    to partnering and parenthood. Foremost among them is the desire\r\nof men to fulfil
    their obligations to their partners and kids without\r\ncommitting career hari-kari.\r\n\r\nSadly,
    research suggests that the handful of men who really do swear off\r\nbreakfast
    meeting, leave at 5:00 to pick up at creche and refuse to work\r\nweekends find
    themselves in the same career cul de sac as working\r\nmothers. Indeed, Australian
    managers are good at making clear to men in\r\nmore ways then one that any worker
    who modifies his schedule to\r\naccommodate new fatherhood will be struck off
    the A-list for the crime\r\nof being inadequately â\x80\x9Cseriousâ\x80\x9D. For
    instance, one study found that just\r\n8% of Australian manager believed fathers
    should be entitled to 52 weeks\r\nunpaid leave after the birth of a baby, while
    a mere third supported a\r\nfive-day a year â\x80\x9Cspecial family leaveâ\x80\x9D
    entitlement.\r\n\r\nWhat all this suggests is that most Australian workplaces
    remain hostile\r\nto anyone who removes their nose from the grindstone, not to
    working\r\nmothers per se. While social convention and pay inequality ensure that\r\nit
    is largely women who will attempt to modify their work patterns to\r\nachieve
    some semblance of balance between work and family - and wind up\r\non the Mummy
    Track for their troubles - working fathers who attempt a\r\nsimilar juggling act
    will suffer the same career misfortune.\r\n\r\nIn the same way that women donâ\x80\x99t
    want to have to take it on the career\r\nchin when they become a mother, many
    men are also reluctant to fulfil\r\ntheir obligations to their partners, kids
    and - given the joy of\r\nfatherhood - themselves at the cost of their satisfaction
    and\r\nadvancement at work. And why should either sex have to pay such a high\r\nand
    enduring cost (in superannuation and lifelong earning capacity, to\r\nname a few)
    for doing the right thing?\r\n\r\nMy answer is that they shouldnâ\x80\x99t. In
    the same way that women are\r\nentitled to resent the high costs Australian society
    demands of those\r\nwho have children and to refuse to buy into manipulative claims
    that if\r\nthey really loved their children they wouldnâ\x80\x99t complain, men
    should also\r\nresist any assertion that if they were really gorgeous men, they
    would\r\nsimply suck up whatever punishment the workplace doles out to active\r\ndads,
    and talk about how they were never really all that\r\ncareer-oriented, anyway.\r\n\r\nRather,
    both genders need to join hands and insist that enough is\r\nenough. Thatâ\x80\x99s
    itâ\x80\x99s become too hard to have children in Australian\r\nsociety today,
    and that something - other than the present and future\r\nbacks of working mothers
    and gorgeous fathers - has to give."
