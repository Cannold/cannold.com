  content: "Since reaching adolescence my boys have been keen to have girls who are
    â\x80\x9Cjust friendsâ\x80\x9D sleep at our house, and I have been just as keen
    to avoid it.\r\n\r\nBoys sleeping over have never been a problem. Over the years
    I have\r\nhappily purchased bunk and trundle beds, as well as air mattresses,
    to\r\nfacilitate it. But female friends? Sorry, I kept telling my sons. Iâ\x80\x99m\r\njust
    not comfortable.\r\n\r\nBut no-because-I-say-so really doesnâ\x80\x99t cut it
    as a reason for adolescent\r\nboys and fair enough, too. Iâ\x80\x99ve always prided
    myself as a person who has\r\nreasons for what I do. As a parent, when I donâ\x80\x99t
    have a good reason for\r\nsaying no, I try to say yes.\r\n\r\nExcept when it came
    to girls sleeping over. Was I worried the girlâ\x80\x99s\r\nfamily was in the
    dark? Maybe, so when my son last asked I agreed to\r\nspeak to the parent. The
    exchange was comforting - the mother certainly\r\nknew where her daughter would
    be and was realistic about my minimal\r\ncapacity for control - but my unease
    persisted.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CYouâ\x80\x99re being unreasonable about this,â\x80\x9D
    my partner said. â\x80\x9CDo you really\r\nwant to imply that boys canâ\x80\x99t
    have friends who are girls?â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nHe shrugged. â\x80\x9CAnd if theyâ\x80\x99re
    going to have sex, isnâ\x80\x99t it better it\r\nhappens here instead of a park
    - away from prying eyes and close to\r\ncondoms?â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nAll good points
    but something still felt wrong, however inept I was at\r\narticulating what it
    was.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CYouâ\x80\x99re acting like youâ\x80\x99re worried your boy
    will take advantage,â\x80\x9D a\r\nfriend finally said.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CNo!â\x80\x9D
    I said firmly. â\x80\x9CThatâ\x80\x99s not it at all. My boys would NEVER touch
    a\r\ngirl in a way they thought she did not want.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nBut here, perhaps,
    was a clue to my discomfort. What if the girl didnâ\x80\x99t\r\nknow what she
    wanted?\r\n\r\nThere is a relatively straightforward relationship for boys between
    what\r\nthey want, what they say they want and what they pursue - with sex, and\r\neverything
    else. Arguably, female socialisation is all about severing\r\nsuch links so women
    can make the needs and wants of others - friends,\r\nparents, needy children,
    ageing parents - their own.\r\n\r\nWe certainly know that adolescence is when
    many girls lose their\r\nvitality, resilience and sense of self. Perhaps consequently,
    it is also\r\na time they are at increased risk of depression and eating disorders.\r\n\r\nAccording
    to researchers Carol Gilligan and Lyn Mikel Brown, girls\r\nstruggle throughout
    their teens to take their own experiences, feelings\r\nand thoughts seriously.
    Some can arrive at a place where it seems to\r\nthem that they cannot say or feel
    what they feel and know. Battling to\r\nstay in a â\x80\x9Cgenuine relationshipâ\x80\x9D
    with themselves, they replace their\r\nauthentic voice with a stream of â\x80\x9CI
    donâ\x80\x99t knowsâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, I had a way of explaining my angst.
    Sexual relationships are\r\ncomplicated at the best of times. Introduce youth
    and the stuttering of\r\na partner who may be in the midst of a developmental
    struggle to\r\nidentify and express what she wants and misunderstandings seem\r\ninevitable.
    I wanted nothing to do with it.\r\n\r\nI also didnâ\x80\x99t want to add to the
    confusing mix of social messages girls\r\nget. What if saying yes to a sleepover
    felt subtly coercive to the girl,\r\nas though I thought adolescent sex was normal
    or even expected. Instead,\r\nI wanted to be like Switzerland when it came to
    adolescent sexual\r\nactivity, wanting only for each young person what she or
    he\r\nauthentically wanted for themselves.\r\n\r\nGood thinking or over-thinking?
    Iâ\x80\x99d welcome your view."
