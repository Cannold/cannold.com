    Blackadderâ\x80\x99s first novel is an exploration of the physical\r\nand eclectic

    for the backpacker set. It follows the chain of\r\nevents set into motion by Zacâ\x80\x99s
    near-death experience at a party given\r\nby the emotionally inscrutable Black
    Dragon. Over a three-week period,\r\nZac, Black Dragon, her friend Madeline and
    Zacâ\x80\x99s girlfriend Kate roam\r\nbetween Sydney and Byron, searching and
    ultimately discovering important\r\ntruths critical to unlocking their true vocation
    or potential for love.\r\n\r\nBlackadder knows Byron well, though she is most
    successful in conveying\r\nits unique hippy cosmopolitan groove indirectly through
    the\r\nmatter-of-fact way she describes some of its more bizarre denizens.\r\nLike,
    for instance, Pan and his half-feral cross-dressing band of male\r\nfaeries who
    rescue Zac after a failed ocean suicide attempt. The\r\nfollowing morning, Zac
    wakes to find himself in a house that is\r\nâ\x80\x9Csingle-handedly holding back
    the advance of the rainforestâ\x80\x9D near a\r\nmake-shift dome enclosing â\x80\x9Ca
    solemn circle of seven men and women and a\r\nsmall, smoky fireâ\x80\x9D. Just
    then a man dressed as a woman in a gold\r\ncocktail gown and a pink feather boa,
    totters into view. â\x80\x9CYoo hoo! Pan!\r\nIâ\x80\x99m late as usual. I lost
    my fucking eyelash on your fucking muddy path.\r\nWhen are you going to get a
    man to do some work about the place?â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nLess convincing are the over-wordy
    riffs about and to the place\r\nsprinkled liberally - and unnecessarily - throughout
    the text. Riffs\r\nthat sometimes run for pages with lines like â\x80\x9CWelcome
    to Byron Bay, so\r\nbeautiful it will make you weepâ\x80\x9D and â\x80\x9CYou
    are the gazuumper on the dream\r\nhome, the developer who buys the last of the
    breach front land.â\x80\x9D I also\r\ngrew to detest the subheadings scattered
    liberally through each chapter.\r\nAt best, they unnecessarily foreshadowed events
    (like the one entitled\r\nâ\x80\x9CFoccaciaâ\x80\x9D that keyed me into the fact
    that the next few paragraphs\r\nwould contain someone eating one). At worst, they
    were eye-rollingly\r\ntwee, like the â\x80\x9CYou Give Me Feverâ\x80\x9D one preceding
    Zacâ\x80\x99s sweat-drenched\r\nawakening to a serous flu-like illness. Occasionally,
    a smug omnipotent\r\nnarrator creeps into the third-person voice, begging the
    question of his\r\nor her identity and source of knowledge about the charactersâ\x80\x99
    pasts and\r\nfutures. For all such errors of judgement, I am more inclined to
    blame\r\neditor than author. It is the latterâ\x80\x99s job to take risks, and
    the\r\nformers to indicate when these succeed and fail.\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes Blackadderâ\x80\x99s
    risks do succeed. Throughout the book is the\r\nmotif of the stalking hand of
    death whose needs must be satiated to\r\nbalance the books of fate. When Zac evades
    deathâ\x80\x99s grasp in the early\r\npages of the book, an aging whale succumbs
    instead, the mourning cries\r\nof its pod filling the ocean with sadness. Later,
    it is the life of a\r\nyoung girl whose story intersects with that of the mysterious
    Black\r\nDragon that is snatched in the place of the new relationships, lives
    and\r\npossibilities that have emerged since the party. None too original, but\r\nBlackadder
    carries it off well, adding to After the Partyâ\x80\x99s cosmic\r\nbeating-of-the-butterflyâ\x80\x99s-wings
    theme of the interconnectedness of\r\nnature and those linked through the bonds
