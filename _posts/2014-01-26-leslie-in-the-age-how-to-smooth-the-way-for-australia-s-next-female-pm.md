  content: "This weekend marks six months since Julia Gillard stepped down from the
    highest office in the land. With International Women's Day on the horizon, it
    is timely to reflect on Gillard's rise and fall.\n\nWhat aspects of Gillard's
    trajectory are emblematic of the challenges faced by female political leaders?
    What can be done to tackle the problems faced by women seeking high political
    office to smooth the way for Australia's next female prime minister?\n\nResearch
    shows male and female leaders are equally good at their jobs. A combined analysis
    of more than 88 studies showed male and female leaders and managers were equally
    effective. Another study showed gender to be a poor predictor of the leadership
    styles managers adopt.\n\nDespite this, male and female leaders are judged differently.
    Leadership was once the exclusive province of men and the qualities that define
    the ideal man - achievement-oriented, able to take charge, autonomous and rational
    - are the same used to describe a good leader. In contrast, the ideal woman fits
    the mould of a follower, not a leader. Obedient and deferential, she is unconcerned
    with achievement but instead focused on understanding and nurturing others.\n\nWe
    like to think such cliches are past their use-by date, but a 2012 paper reveals
    they are alive and well in the way men and women describe themselves and their
    opposites. Worse, data shows the consistency of gender stereotypes across cultures.
    In one survey, respondents from 25 countries largely agreed on the adjectives
    associated with men and women, with males assigned more agency-oriented words
    while more communal-oriented words were used to describe women.\n\nSuch biases
    don't mean we're consciously sexist. Some are what psychologists call ''mind bugs'',
    implicit biases traced to the evolutionary past when we needed to make snap judgments
    about others - judgments that often proved wrong - to stay alive.\n\nThe persistence
    of such gender dichotomies puts women leaders such as Gillard in a ''double-bind''
    that renders them damned - or doomed. If they strive to fit the male ''good leader''
    template they may be judged effective, but will be marked down as unfeminine and
    even unlikeable. If they attend to the psychic and nurturing of others, they'll
    get a tick for femininity but fail in the competent leader stakes.\n\nGillard's
    misfit with expectations of women as ethical leaders may also have laid her low.
    Australia's tradition of what historian Marilyn Lake calls maternal feminism casts
    women in the role of what Anne Summers called ''God's Police''.\n\nGillard's reputation
    as a negotiator, and what she describes as her focus while in office on ''how
    you get it done, the pragmatic things, even the compromises, the things that are
    necessary to achieve change'', made it hard to for the electorate to understand
    the matters on which she would stand and fight. While a male leader might have
    been praised for passing more than 570 pieces of legislation and his pragmatic
    capacity to get things done, Gillard may have been punished for violating the
    stereotype of female politicians as a moral cut above the rest because of the
    perception she lacked moral bottom lines.\n\nSuch character concerns resurfaced
    in the wake of the misogyny speech, when Gillard was lambasted for playing the
    gender card. According to academic Diann Rodgers-Healey, the key message is that
    female politicians who wish to call out sexism as it affects them need to ensure
    that the elimination of gender discrimination as it affects all women is central
    to their platform from the day dot. Calling in others to name and shame - rather
    than doing it themselves - may also help avoid the whinger, excuse-maker and other-blamer
    tags.\n\nHow can we ease the way, for Australia's next female PM? Gillard's ascendancy
    to the top job has partly achieved this. Having a female prime minister is the
    most powerful way to normalise women in leadership roles. Her tenure will have
    kick-started the aspirations of a whole new generation of girls who, having witnessed
    that the top political job is open to them, will strive to attain it.\n\nBut we
    must do more. Gillard's story shows that a male mentor - in her case Bill Shorten
    - can be a key ingredient in a female politician's rise to the top. This is true
    in the business world, too, a fact recognised by Sex Discrimination Commissioner
    Elizabeth Broderick's ''male champions for change'' initiative. We must also strive
    for society-wide understanding that sexism is as abhorrent and unjust as racism,
    and must be abolished.\n\nMost critical is that well-heeled feminists and men
    fund an organisation dedicated to finding and nurturing the expertise to innovate,
    advocate and educate around sexism. \n\nSuch a think tank would fast-track Australia
    through what researchers have identified as a four-stage program to equalise women's
    access to the political reins of power. Australia's tradition of transient, volunteer
    and issue-based advocacy, based on middle-class married women and students having
    the financial resources to donate limited bursts of their time, is past its use-by
    date.\n\nStaging an effective fight against conscious and unconscious sexism requires
    the permanent installation of a well-funded, bipartisan, professional women's
