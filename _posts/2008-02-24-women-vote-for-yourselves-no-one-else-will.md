    the annoyingly wooden\r\naffect, and her obeisance over the years to the demands
    of the American\r\npublic that she change her name and hair, but stand by her
    man. But when\r\nI mailed in my absentee ballot for the Democratic primaries several\r\nmonths
    ago (Iâ\x80\x99m an American citizen as well as an Australian one) the\r\ntic
    was next to Hilary Clintonâ\x80\x99s name, not Barrack Obamaâ\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nMy
    reason? Simple. Sheâ\x80\x99s a woman and so am I. While Obama (and I admit\r\nitâ\x80\x99s
    part of his charm) is a man.\r\n\r\nBut is voting for another woman - to make
    partner, win a seat on a board\r\nor lead the free world - the right thing to
    do? I say yes, for now at\r\nleast, while women remain so woefully under-represented
    at all levels of\r\npower.\r\n\r\nVoting patterns in the US Democratic primaries
    suggest that while 90 per\r\ncent of Black Americans - male and female - have
    supported Obama,\r\nClintonâ\x80\x99s support among White women struggles at times
    to top 50 per\r\ncent. White men have been backing other men since the contest
    began and\r\nnow, with only one bloke left standing, are tending towards Obama.\r\n\r\nIn
    other words, while men vote for men and Blacks for Blacks, American\r\nwomen are
    taking the high road and voting for the one they believe -\r\nregardless of skin
    colour or pant tackle - will do the best job. And\r\nwhile Iâ\x80\x99ve yet to
    hear any condemnation of Black Americans for voting as\r\na bloc to put one of
    their own into the Oval Office, a startling number\r\nof women are scrambling
    over themselves to show theyâ\x80\x99d never be so base.\r\nInfluential talk-show
    host Oprah Winfrey, for instance, was recently\r\nquoted as saying she would â\x80\x9Cnever
    vote for anyone based on gender or\r\nrace. Iâ\x80\x99m voting for Barack Obamaâ\x80¦because
    he is brilliantâ\x80\x9D. Australian\r\ncolumnist Anita Quiqley has expressed
    similar indignation that anyone\r\nshould think sheâ\x80\x99d be partial to a
    politician of her own sex.\r\n\r\nThe upshot of all this is not hard to predict.
    Men l - despite\r\nhand-on-heart protestations of gender-blindness - will continue
    to help\r\nother men into office and, if predications of a Democrat victory in
    the\r\n2008 election prove correct, Americans may soon have their first Black\r\npresident.\r\n\r\nAnd
    women? Well, weâ\x80\x99ll just keep tending our small patch of\r\nnot-all-that-much
    and living on borrowed glory. Because without the\r\nsupport of other women Hilary,
    like those who came before her seeking\r\nhigh office, will return home empty-handed.\r\n\r\nIf
    we really lived in a gender-blind, equal opportunity world, womenâ\x80\x99s\r\nscanty
    representation at the top would be easy to explain. It would be\r\nbecause we
    lacked ambition, or the right stuff. That most of us, most of\r\nthe time, fail
    to measure up.\r\n\r\nBut US voting patterns are only the most recent in a long
    line of\r\nevidence that the world as we know it - in this way and a number of\r\nothers
    - isnâ\x80\x99t fair. To change it, we need to be among those who are in\r\ncharge.
    And to do that, we need to back ourselves.\r\n\r\nAnd thatâ\x80\x99s why, for
    now, I think itâ\x80\x99s OK for women to vote for women for\r\nno other reason
    than that they are women. After all, if we donâ\x80\x99t when\r\nother marginalized
    groups do, weâ\x80\x99ll be the only ones coming up chumps.\r\n\r\nAnd because
    if we canâ\x80\x99t bring ourselves to back ourselves, why should\r\nany one else?"
