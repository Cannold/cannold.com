  content: "Craig Venter is back in the news. The entrepreneurial geneticist\r\nrecently
    announced he has created a new form of synthetic life. The new\r\nmicrobe, which
    thrives and replicates with only a man-made genome, paves\r\nthe way for a world
    full of organisms that are built to order rather\r\nthan evolved.\r\n\r\nThe technique,
    reported in the peer-reviewed journal *Science*, required\r\n20 scientists, ten
    years and $USD40 million to develop. ExxonMobil,\r\nhowever, has already placed
    an order with the J Craig Venter Institute\r\nfor an algae that can convert carbon
    dioxide from the atmosphere into\r\nfuel, taking estimates of value into the trillions.\r\n\r\nSo
    far, concerns about the development by ethicists and religionists\r\nhave been
    predictable, and largely miss the point. Yes, there are risks\r\nthe organism
    could jump the lab, but Venter has inserted what he says\r\nare fail-safe mechanisms
    into the microbe to render it harmless in the\r\noutside world. All scientific
    inquiry entails some risk. The question is\r\nwhether those risks can be managed
    and are worth taking given the\r\npossible benefits.\r\n\r\nIt is also true that
    Venterâ\x80\x99s contribution allows humans to play God,\r\nbut surely this is
    what humans have long sought to do. How else can we\r\nunderstand humankindâ\x80\x99s
    attempts to predict earthquakes or vaccinate\r\nagainst diseases than a spirited
    attempt to control and influence the\r\nvagaries of the natural - or God given
    - world?\r\n\r\nThe real problems posed by the Venter development are the stale
    legal\r\nand policy frameworks governing the world into which itâ\x80\x99s been
    birthed.\r\nVenter makes much of the â\x80\x9Csocietal goodâ\x80\x9D he believes
    will come of what\r\nhe describes as â\x80\x9Cone of the most powerful technologies
    and industrial\r\ndriversâ\x80\x9D. He says he is concerned that the applications
    of his work are\r\nused â\x80\x9Cfor the benefit of allâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nMaybe.
    But in a world where key features of modern day patent law date\r\nback to the
    1600â\x80\x99s, and permit individuals or corporations to lock up\r\nscientific
    knowledge as a source of private profit, consideration of the\r\npublic good remains
    optional.\r\n\r\nVentorâ\x80\x99s history suggests a keen interest in making knowledge
    critical\r\nto public health private intellectual property. His man-made microbe\r\ncontains
    watermarks, five amino acid codes, that include quotations, an\r\nemail address
    and the names of people involved in the Â£30million project\r\n(Dr Frankenstein
    not included).\r\n\r\nIn the 1990s, his former company Celera Genomics raced against
    a\r\npublicly funded project to sequence the human genome. At the time, he\r\nhad
    already applied to control the intellectual rights on more than 300\r\ngenes.\r\n\r\nLuckily,
    he lost. In 2000 then-US President Clinton and British Prime\r\nMinister Tony
    Blair jointly announced that an international consortium\r\nworking cooperatively
    and funded by public monies had produced a rough\r\ndraft of the genome, which
    a White House press release said would â\x80\x9Clead\r\nto new ways to prevent,
    diagnose, treat and cure diseaseâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nBut we may not be so lucky next
    time, and this is the point. New areas\r\nof science like genomics have long been
    outpacing the laws and policies\r\nthat seek to govern them. Legislators and regulators
    urgently need to\r\ncatch up.\r\n\r\nOur view is that where existing research
    and intellectual property\r\nframeworks are adequate to ensure that the building
    blocks of life -\r\nwhether evolved or created-remain in public hands, well and
    good.\r\n\r\nBut where such frameworks tilt towards handing any individual or\r\ncorporation
    sole ownership of knowledge, knowledge that belongs to and\r\ncan be used to benefit
    all of us, we have a problem. A problem most\r\nrecently seen in the shut down
    of research critical to discovering the\r\ncures for diseases like autism, brain
    cancer and neurological disease by\r\nStemCells Inc on the grounds that the researcher
    was using a technique\r\nhe had helped develop but they had patented.\r\n\r\nPatents
    over genes, the building blocks of life or what Venter calls\r\nâ\x80\x98DNA computer
    code,â\x80\x99 are wrong. They are wrong in moral and in practical\r\nterms. They
    are wrong because they allow individuals or corporations to\r\nexclusively control
    information that belongs to all of us, and wrong\r\nbecause their patents discourage
    scientific progress or reserve its\r\nbenefits to those who can pay.\r\n\r\nThis
    view is shared by Nobel prize winners Joseph Stiglitz and John\r\nSulston, who
    recently argued in *The Wall Street Journal* that gene\r\npatents, â\x80\x9Cnot
    only prevent the use of knowledge in ways that would most\r\nbenefit society,
    they may even impede scientific progress. Every\r\nscientific advance is built
    on those that came before it. There is still\r\na great deal to learn about our
    genes, particularly how they contribute\r\nto disease. Gene patents inhibit access
    to the most basic informationâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nVenterâ\x80\x99s synthetic life
    form only adds weight to the passionate claims\r\nfrom medical associations, geneticists,
    patients and academics have been\r\nmaking for years that the patenting of human
    genes is unproductive and\r\nunfair and must be stopped.\r\n\r\nNext month a long-awaited
    report from the Australian Senate into the\r\nimpact of the granting of patents
    over human and microbial genes will be\r\nhanded down. Australian lawmakers must
    not miss this critical\r\nopportunity to ensure that this countryâ\x80\x99s regulatory
    framework places\r\nthe health and wellbeing of the Australian people and Australian\r\nenvironment
