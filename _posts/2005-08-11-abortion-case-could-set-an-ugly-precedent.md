    writes\r\nLeslie Cannold. The charging of Dr Suman Sood for manslaughter and\r\nprocuring
    an unlawful abortion in NSW is the first such prosecution in\r\nthat state since
    1971, though it was only seven years ago that two West\r\nAustralian doctors were
    charged as criminals for providing terminations.\r\nIndeed, Australia has a long
    history of prosecuting women and doctors\r\nover abortions and, because of the
    consistent refusal of politicians to\r\nlegislate progressively on the issue,
    common law rulings have had a\r\nprofound impact on the development of abortion
    law.\r\n\r\nWhat might Soodâ\x80\x99s prosecution - for terminating the pregnancy
    of a woman\r\nwho was between 21 to 24 weeks pregnant - mean for the women of
    NSW and\r\nthe nation? If found guilty, she could be jailed and deregistered,\r\nrelieving
    women of the risks they were unknowingly assuming by placing\r\nthemselves in
    the doctorâ\x80\x99s care.\r\n\r\nBut the DPPâ\x80\x99s prosecutory strategy may
    also pose significant risks to\r\nAustralian womenâ\x80\x99s reproductive autonomy
    and health. If successful, it\r\nwill reaffirm the regulation of abortion under
    the Crimes, rather than\r\nthe Health Act, and by so doing the potential criminality
    of abortion\r\nservice providers and their patients. This reassertion of the\r\nquasi-illicit
    nature of the procedure will ensure that it continues to\r\nbe surrounded by secrecy
    and stigma and, as a result, that womenâ\x80\x99s\r\naccess to quality information
    and timely services suffers.\r\n\r\nIt will also give a new millennium stamp of
    approval to the lawâ\x80\x99s\r\npatronising contempt of womenâ\x80\x99s capacity
    to make important moral\r\ndecisions for themselves and by themselves, without
    judicial approval or\r\nmedical oversight. Such a reconfirmation of womenâ\x80\x99s
    status as\r\nsecond-class citizens in need of patriarchal guidance could be felt\r\nacross
    Australia. Not just because of the anti-choice rabidity of\r\npowerful players
    in the Howard Government, but because of its\r\npotentially persuasive effect
    on states with similar legal frameworks.\r\nReconfirmation of the legal status
    quo in NSW, in other words, might\r\nlead other states, like Victoria, to affix
    fresh seals of approval on\r\ntheir existing abortion laws. A particular worry
    is that the Bracks\r\nGovernment, now modernising the criminal code, might leave
    Victoriaâ\x80\x99s\r\narchaic abortion statutes untouched.\r\n\r\nBut it is the
    manslaughter charge that has the greatest potential to\r\nundermine womenâ\x80\x99s
    reproductive autonomy, although it may also offer the\r\npossibility of more ethical
    care for pregnant women. As usual, it is the\r\nsmall number of women seeking
    postâ\x80\x9320-week terminations that are at\r\ngreatest risk of a loss of dignity,
    quality of care or services all\r\ntogether. Figures suggest most women terminating
    later are responding to\r\nthe diagnosis of serious foetal defects, including
    conditions that will\r\nlead the baby to suffer and die shortly after birth. Not
    surprisingly,\r\nsome women and couples opt for termination as the most ethical
    option in\r\nsuch tragic, no-win circumstances.\r\n\r\nBut what many people do
    not know is that women are finding it harder and\r\nharder to access post~~20-week
    terminations inside and outside of\r\nhospitals. Across the country, only a few
    clinics provide them.\r\nIncreasing numbers of hospitals are refusing to offer
    any on religious\r\ngrounds, while others have adopted time-consuming and secretive\r\nassessment
    processes that deliver verdicts~~ on unclear grounds - to\r\nwomen about their
    eligibility for services.\r\n\r\nIn addition, most clinics and hospitals compel
    women to labour and give\r\nbirth to their dead baby, despite clear and convincing
    evidence that in\r\nskilled hands, surgical termination improves womenâ\x80\x99s
    physical and mental\r\noutcomes.\r\n\r\nUnlike a surgical procedure, induction
    of labour carries the risk of a\r\nfoetus being born alive. This is what happened
    in Soodâ\x80\x99s case, and may\r\naccount for the manslaughter charge. Of course,
    not all foetuses born\r\nalive are viable. A recent study of British and Irish
    birth outcomes\r\nfound that of those born before 24 weeks, only 15 per cent left
    hospital\r\nand half of these had significant cognitive and neurological impairment.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    the low survive-and-thrive rate of infants at â\x80\x9Cthresholdâ\x80\x9D\r\nviability
    does not change the moral and medical unacceptability of\r\nallowing foetuses
    to live, and possibly suffer through, the abortive\r\nprocedure. If a guilty verdict
    in Soodâ\x80\x99s case means that doctors will in\r\nfuture select procedures
    where this cannot happen, then women and their\r\nfamilies - knowing they have
    acted to prevent suffering, not cause it -\r\nwill benefit. What we canâ\x80\x99t
    allow is medical practitioners using the\r\nmanslaughter charge as another excuse
    to further tighten womenâ\x80\x99s access\r\nto postâ\x80\x9320-week procedures.
    Nationally, the numbers of such procedures\r\nis small (about 4 per cent), but
    each one is a tale of heartache,\r\nethical dilemma and considered moral decision-making
    by the only people\r\nwith the information to know whatâ\x80\x99s necessary and
    right: the woman and,\r\nif she has one, her partner.\r\n\r\nSociety must not
    tolerate rogue medical providers. But neither must we\r\nallow isolated cases
    to deprive women and couples of critical health\r\ncare when they need it."
