    to a\r\nwheelchair by a disease that causes him immense suffering. The condition\r\nhas
    haunted your family for generations, killing male children and\r\nputting the
    female ones at risk of passing the faulty chromosome on to\r\ntheir own kids.\r\n\r\nThe
    disease is haeomophilia, a disease of the blood that, while\r\ntreatable, causes
    a lifetime of pain and disability.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that, while no cure
    exists, there is technology that\r\ncan help. Bypassing the pleasure and privacy
    of sex, you can conceive\r\nusing IVF. Scientists will â\x80\x9Cdiagnoseâ\x80\x9D
    the sex of your embryos, discard\r\nthe affected males and implant a female. Nine
    months later a healthy\r\ngirl will be born.\r\n\r\nOr not. Last week Victorian
    couple Fiona and Paul took action in the\r\nSupreme Court against Melbourne IVF,
    Ballarat Health Services, their\r\nobstetrician and Bendigo Radiology for failing
    to tell them that, in\r\nspite of all their pre-implantation efforts, Fiona was
    gestating a boy.\r\nHad they known, the couple says they would have considered
    termination\r\nand their son Jesse, who came into the world with a severe form
    of\r\nhaemophilia, may never have been born.\r\n\r\nThe success of the coupleâ\x80\x99s
    case will turn on the particulars of their\r\nsituation, but recent Australian
    court decisions on â\x80\x9Cwrongful birthsâ\x80\x9D\r\nhave favoured the parents.
    In 2003, the High Court upheld a lower\r\ncourtâ\x80\x99s decision to compensate
    Kerry Anne and Craig Melchior for a\r\nhealthy boy, Jordan, who would not have
    been born but for Kerry Anneâ\x80\x99s\r\ndoctor botching her sterilization.\r\n\r\nThe
    logic of the pro-compensation camp is compelling. Contraception and\r\npre-natal
    screening are designed to prevent the birth of a particular\r\nchild - one affected
    by disease - or any child at all. Society cannot\r\nallow parents to avoid the
    birth of children they say they cannot\r\nparent, but then deny them compensation
    when their prevention efforts\r\nfail through no fault of their own.\r\n\r\nDespite
    this, such cases perplex and confound. We all know that\r\nconferring immunity
    on incompetent doctors is a recipe for health-care\r\ndisaster, yet feel sick
    at the thought of a child discovering later in\r\nlife - perhaps in excruciating
    detail - how much his parents wished heâ\x80\x99d\r\nnot been born.\r\n\r\nBut
    what we need to keep in mind is that the way parents like Fiona and\r\nPaul feel
    about a child they havenâ\x80\x99t yet conceived, or a very early\r\nembryo in
    vivo or vitro, is very different to the emotions provoked by a\r\nnewborn lying
    in their arms. Indeed, it is this difference that leads\r\nthem to try and avoid
    a very sick child being born in the first place.\r\nBecause they know that once
    that child arrives, sick or not, they will\r\nlove him, and suffer with him. Indeed,
    it is to avoid this - the loving\r\nof a sick and suffering child - that they
    sought in good faith to avoid,\r\nand for this child that they sue, not for themselves.
    Because while\r\nmoney is good for hospital bills and respite care, it wonâ\x80\x99t
    touch the\r\nguilt and heartache born every day by the parents of a chronically
    sick\r\nkid.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding this ends the mystery of why nearly all pregnant
    women who\r\ncanâ\x80\x99t parent choose adoption over abortion. Because abortion
    lets them\r\nhalt the development of something that, if born, they would love
    and\r\nfeel they could never give away to another. Their child."
