    those held by the remainder of the citizenry.\r\n\r\nI recently returned to Australia
    from Seville, where I attended an\r\ninternational conference on all aspects of
    abortion care. Among the\r\nissues discussed were the barriers women face to accessing
    termination\r\nservices, even in countries where the procedure is legal.\r\n\r\nForemost
    among these is refusal by medical practitioners and healthcare\r\ninstitutions
    on grounds of religion or conscience. They include\r\nreligious doctors as well
    as public hospitals and clinics operated by\r\nCatholic groups and associations.
    Abortion is not the only service such\r\nindividuals and institutions donâ\x80\x99t
    offer. The list includes birth\r\ncontrol (including emergency contraception for
    rape victims),\r\nsterilisations, infertility services and comprehensive HIV/Aids\r\nprevention
    information.\r\n\r\nWomen suffer profound costs to their health and dignity when
    the medical\r\nprofessionals and institutions they are forced to rely on - and
    whose\r\nsalaries and budgets they fund through their taxes - disregard the\r\ninformed
    choices they make about their reproductive healthcare. In\r\nPoland, a woman effectively
    lost her sight when all three of the doctors\r\nwho predicted this outcome refused
    to grant permission for her to abort.\r\nIn Columbia, a 13-year-old rape victim
    was repeatedly refused an\r\nabortion despite her attempts at suicide when pregnancy
    and sexually\r\ntransmitted infections were diagnosed. Countless women across
    the world\r\nhave had religious doctors deny them accurate results from pre-natal\r\nscans
    to preclude them having the option of abortion.\r\n\r\nDespite the heartless and
    arrogant nature of such medical practice,\r\nCatholic medical staff and institutions
    staunchly defend it, and dismiss\r\nthe suffering and loss of autonomy women endure
    as a result. In\r\nAustralia, where the state of Victoria recently passed an abortion
    law\r\nthat required refusing doctors to refer and to treat in a\r\nlife-threatening
    emergency, Catholic leaders slammed the new law as the\r\nâ\x80\x9Cnastiest human
    rights abuseâ\x80\x9D. A group calling itself Doctors in\r\nConscience condemned
    the demand that religious doctors provide an\r\nabortion where their refusal would
    see a woman die as ushering in â\x80\x9Ca new\r\nera of healthcare in Australia
    in which individual health workers and\r\nhealthcare organisations can be coerced
    to act contrary to their\r\nconsciencesâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nIn the same way religious
    doctors and institutions deny the rights and\r\nduties of medical colleagues whose
    conscience impels them to support a\r\nwomanâ\x80\x99s informed medical choice
    to abort a problem pregnancy. When a\r\n27-year-old mother of four staggered into
    a Catholic hospital in America\r\nlast November, 11 weeks pregnant and gravely
    ill, the doctors told her\r\nthat if she continued with the pregnancy her risk
    of mortality was\r\nâ\x80\x9Cclose to 100%â\x80\x9D. But when Sister Margaret
    McBride authorised the\r\nabortion necessary to save the womanâ\x80\x99s life,
    she was sacked and\r\nexcommunicated. The priest heading up the hospital ethics
    committee\r\njustified this decision with the pronouncement that: â\x80\x9CThe
    reason for [an\r\nabortion] never matters.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nSecular moral principles
    - those to which everyone in society can\r\nsubscribe - do not support the unilateral
    denial by medical\r\npractitioners of particular types of care to certain sorts
    of patients.\r\nThis is for the simple reason that no right, whether legal or
    moral, is\r\nabsolute.\r\n\r\nThe rights of a religious medical provider to refuse
    to terminate a\r\npregnancy must be balanced against the similarly compelling
    rights of\r\nthe patient to follow her conscience in choosing abortion. Medical\r\npractitioners
    also have an obligation to treat, a duty that in part\r\nflows from the monopoly
    they exercise over healthcare. Patients,\r\nrelatedly, have a right to timely
    medical care as well as an entitlement\r\nnot suffer direct or indirect sex discrimination.\r\n\r\nThe
    religious rights of a small group of medical professionals do not\r\nâ\x80\x9Ctrumpâ\x80\x9D
    those held by the remainder of the citizenry. A compromise\r\nbetween the two
    is required.\r\n\r\nA consensus on the necessary features of such a settlement
    is now\r\nemerging from statutes and case law in jurisdictions around the world.\r\nSo
    far, what seems to be agreed is that institutions lack consciences.\r\nOnly individuals
    have a right to refuse care on conscience grounds.\r\nMedical staff who are directly
    involved with the procedure are the only\r\nones entitled to refuse co-operation
    on conscience grounds, and such\r\nrefusals cannot encompass pre- or post-operative
    care. Emergency\r\nabortion care must be provided and, in non-urgent cases, medical\r\nprofessionals
    must disclose their conscientious objection to the patient\r\nas soon as possible
    and ensure an effective referral is made.\r\nInstitutions and healthcare systems
    must guarantee the availability of\r\nfull-service staff to meet patientsâ\x80\x99
    demand and there must be\r\nconsequences for an individual or institution where
    conscience claims\r\nresult in women being denied the care to which they are entitled.\r\n\r\nThe
    final feature of emerging conscience law also constitutes my final\r\nethical
    point about conscientious action - that it cannot be invoked to\r\nviolate the
    fundamental right of women to lawful healthcare.\r\nConscientious exemptions to
    treat are grounded in concerns about dirty\r\nhands and the limited right of an
    individual, in a society committed to\r\nindividual freedom, to avoid direct involvement
    with something her\r\nconscience or religion forbids. Deploying conscience claims
    as a means\r\nto deny womenâ\x80\x99s access to lawful services, however, lacks
    all moral\r\nlegitimacy.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that morality precludes medical
    objectors from moving\r\nbeyond the avoidance of doing wrong themselves to acting
    to stop what\r\nthey believe is wrong all together. Rather it is to remind them
    that\r\nsuch behaviour is called civil disobedience - not conscientious\r\nobjection
    - and requires far more sacrifice from them (including a\r\nwillingness to go
    to prison) to be worthy of respect."
