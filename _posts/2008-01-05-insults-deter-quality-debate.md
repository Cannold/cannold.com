    Menacingly rude - and just plain mean - when they donâ\x80\x99t agree with\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nGet
    a load of this. â\x80\x9CYour article was stupid. How dare you leave out\r\n[thing
    I felt was really important here]. You are totally unethical and\r\nshould not
    be allowed to write in the newspaper ever againâ\x80\x9D. Or this\r\none. â\x80\x9CYou
    liar! I have forwarded your article to all my friends so they\r\ncan see the left-wing
    drivel passing for informed comment these daysâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the problem
    is the role models.\r\n\r\nThe tabloids have always done it, but in the last few
    years, the quality\r\npapers have also begun running columnists who describe those
    who do, say\r\nor believe things they donâ\x80\x99t agree with as stupid, obnoxious,
    smug,\r\nselfish, ignorant, idiots, yobs, whackers, louts, fools, barbarians and\r\nharpies.\r\n\r\nThe
    editorial justification defence for this new â\x80\x9Cconversationalâ\x80\x9D
    style\r\nis simple: it gets readers going. And there seems little argument that\r\nthis
    is true. Technology takes the guess work out of how many times such\r\narticles
    are read, forwarded to friends and blogged about on media and\r\nother sites in
    comparison to their more traditional cousins. The number\r\nof furious and indignant
    letters to the editor they attract and the book\r\ncontracts, TV guest spots and
    radio gigs offered to their authors are\r\nalso beyond dispute.\r\n\r\nBut at
    what cost? Insults are not a substitute for argument. In fact,\r\nthey may get
    in the way of it. Traditional opinion writing was designed\r\nto persuade but
    tabloid comment polarises. And while itâ\x80\x99s true that\r\ninsulting people
    makes them angry, defensive and resentful - and angry,\r\ndefensive and resentful
    people are more likely to throw quick,\r\nthoughtless counterpunches designed
    to defend their honour and get their\r\nown back - its hard to see how such â\x80\x9Cengagementâ\x80\x9D
    advances the noble\r\ngoals of public debate that opinion writing was designed
    to serve: the\r\nachievement of consensus about the causes and priority of social
    and\r\npolitical problems. A consensus necessary, though not sufficient, to\r\nthose
    problems being addressed.\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s important to be clear here. My concern
    is not with conflict. We\r\nshould not be afraid to disagree, strenuously if necessary,
    about things\r\nthat matter. The issue is how we express such disagreements, and
    react\r\nwhen others disagree with us. In the academic philosophy department\r\nwhere
    I worked for years, we might spend all morning in a seminar\r\ndescribing one
    anotherâ\x80\x99s arguments as illogical, premised on a falsehood\r\nor just plain
    incoherent. Then weâ\x80\x99d all go to lunch. Like Christians who\r\nhate the
    sin but love the sinner, philosophers are trained to draw their\r\nswords against
    ideas they believe erroneous, but to maintain respectful\r\n- if not fond - relationships
    with those expressing them. Conflict over\r\nideas is just that: nothing personal.\r\n\r\nMaking
    it personal - playing the ball, rather than the person - may\r\nspark people into
    action in the short term, but thereâ\x80\x99s little evidence\r\nit engages in
    the long run. Indeed, it seems possible that when readers\r\nreact to being described
    as insecure or stupid,\" by firing off a furious\r\ncomment to a blog, or calling
    into a radio station that is using the\r\npiece as a jumping off point for talkback,
    they achieve the catharsis\r\nrequired for them to move on despite having done
    little - perhaps even\r\nnothing - to achieve meaningful or lasting change.\r\n\r\nIn
    contrast, though itâ\x80\x99s harder work than throwing bombs, winning the\r\nbattle
    of ideas through persuasion - the old hearts and minds trick -\r\nlays the foundation
    for achieving the intellectual engagement and moral\r\noutrage that sustains a
    long-term commitment to making the world a\r\nbetter place.\r\n\r\nIf columnists
    want to open mail from readers that doesnâ\x80\x99t make wince or\r\nfeel physically
    threatened, they are obligated to collectively model\r\ndebating styles that are
    intellectually rigorous and respectful -\r\nimplicitly and explicitly - of the
    entitlement of others to disagree.\r\n\r\nI can hear the counter-arguments, now.
    That young people find\r\ntraditional styles of opinion-writing boring and unengaging.
    That paper\r\nand web-based newspaper opinion pages are large enough to accommodate\r\nall
    sorts of styles. That persuasion is not the only legitimate goal of\r\nan opinion
    piece. Provoking, amusing, entertaining, comforting and\r\neducating readers are
    also worthy goals.\r\n\r\nThatâ\x80\x99s fine. Disagree with me all you like.
    Just take care how you put\r\nyour case."
