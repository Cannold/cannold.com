    we have\r\nin teaching scripture in our primary schools â\x80¦ is that weâ\x80\x99re
    allowed to\r\nteach it up to an hour a week â\x80¦ I spoke to a â\x80¦ student
    â\x80¦ and I said:\r\nâ\x80\x98Did you know that God loves you?â\x80\x99 and he
    said: â\x80\x98No I didnâ\x80\x99t.â\x80\x99 Then I\r\nwent through John 3:16
    and asked him if heâ\x80\x98d ever heard that before and\r\nhe said â\x80\x99No.â\x80\x99
    And it shocked me [that] â\x80¦ this boy didnâ\x80\x99t even know that\r\nhis
    creator loved him and cared about him â\x80¦ and sent him the Lord Jesus.\r\nThe
    challenge is before us to capture the hearts and minds of children\r\nand youth,
    to talk about Jesus in the scripture classes â\x80¦â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThis is Janet.
    She works for YouthWorks. Hereâ\x80\x99s how she advised her\r\nfellow scripture
    teachers to defend against the â\x80\x9Cthreatâ\x80\x9D posed by ethics\r\nclasses
    being available to primary kids whose parents opt them out of\r\nreligious education:\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CIn
    the younger years we need to sow the seeds strongly of the gospel\r\nand scripture.

    scripture into peopleâ\x80\x99s homes, so that by the time [kids] are in\r\nyear

    they wonâ\x80\x99t be so easily falling for the ethics material.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThis
    is Health Minister Nicola Roxon, who earlier this year rejected the\r\nfindings
    of the governmentâ\x80\x99s own preventive health taskforce to regulate\r\nthe
    volume and types of advertising directed at young children.\\\r\nâ\x80\x9CWhile

    that may unduly influence them, the government will not\r\nconsider regulatory
    action at this time.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nAdults are confused. Confused not so much
    as to the special\r\nvulnerability of young children to adult attempts to influence
    them (my\r\nreading of the above quotes suggest they understand this very well),
    but\r\nconfused as to what this vulnerability demands of the grown-ups who are\r\nin
    a position to influence children, particularly if they hold positions\r\nof authority.\r\n\r\nIf
    only influence-peddlers would self-regulate. If only they were the\r\nsort of
    people who, however much they stood to gain financially or\r\nhowever worthy they
    thought their message, would never take advantage of\r\na childâ\x80\x99s innocence
    to clinch a sale.\r\n\r\nDonâ\x80\x99t hold your breath. YouthWorksâ\x80\x99 advice
    to religious education\r\nteachers to hit six-year-olds hard to defend against
    later parental\r\ndecisions to opt their kids out of religious education is risible.\r\nAustralian
    industry is no better, with self-regulation having led to\r\nnothing more than
    a marked increase in food marketing to kids.\\\r\nParents are often lambasted
    for not shielding their offspring from such\r\nunfair influence but childrenâ\x80\x99s
    ads come via the net, TV, Facebook,\r\nemail and mobile phones. Without umbilical
    attachment, no parent can\r\ndefend against this, which may be why 91 per cent
    of consumers in a 2008\r\nsurvey supported stronger government action.\r\n\r\nChildren
    are easily misled. They lack the cognitive skills and abilities\r\nto â\x80\x9Creadâ\x80\x9D
    persuasive messages, whether these come at them in the\r\nclassroom, or via a
    screen. From ages six to seven, kids think ads offer\r\ninformation, while those
    aged seven to eight canâ\x80\x99t discern the\r\ndifference between information
    and the intent of an ad to persuade. By\r\nages 10 to 12, most kids are still
    unable to identify the sales\r\ntechniques being used to get them to say, â\x80\x9Cyesâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nThat
