    that womenâ\x80\x99s problems spring from their lack of modesty - or, to\r\nput
    it more crudely, their inability to keep their knickers above their\r\nknees.\r\n\r\nWeighing
    in on the Clinton-Lewinsky affair, Shalit concludes that the\r\ncore social problem
    exposed by Lewinskyâ\x80\x99s behavior in the White House is\r\nyoung womenâ\x80\x99s
    lack of sexual and moral inhibitions. I thought it was\r\ntheir seeming belief
    that the surest route into the Oval Office is still\r\non their knees.\r\n\r\nIt
    shouldnâ\x80\x99t be surprising that Shalit and other twenty-something women,\r\nweaned
    on Reagan and Thatcherite notions of personal responsibility,\r\nlook to women
    themselves as the source of their own misery. As the Gen X\r\nwomen in Kathy Bailâ\x80\x99s
    DIY Feminism note, blaming patriarchal society for\r\nfemale problems makes a
    girl guilty of â\x80\x9Cself-pity and the worst kind of\r\npassivityâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nIf
    Bail is right, many Gen X women see the sourcing of female\r\nunhappiness in social
    causes (or the naming of the personal as the\r\npolitical) as an unacceptable
    mimicry of the approach of the previous\r\ngenerations (â\x80\x9Cthe mothersâ\x80\x9D).
    In the eyes of â\x80\x9Cthe daughtersâ\x80\x9D, such\r\nidentification prohibits
    the separation necessary for young women to\r\ncreate their own generational approach
    to problems and change.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of the individual-responsibility
    approach to womenâ\x80\x99s\r\nproblems is that in claiming our lives are the
    result of our â\x80\x9Cchoicesâ\x80\x9D,\r\nwe emphasise female agency and control.\r\n\r\nBut
    allocating agency and control to womenâ\x80\x99s lives when little exists\r\nleaves
    us unable to name the political difficulties that are making our\r\npersonal lives
    hell. And if we cannot source a problem back to its\r\norigins in social beliefs
    and organisation, then we cannot alter the\r\nideas or institutions that have
    caused it. We remain stuck, blaming and\r\nhating ourselves for problems for which
    we actually bear little\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nAnd this is only one of the
    problems with an analysis that places female\r\nsexual conduct at the heart of
    all that ails women. The second is the\r\nre-activation of the sexual double standard,
    a re-activation that in the\r\nAbbott and Costello libel case led to the awarding
    of one of the biggest\r\ndefamation payouts in ACT history. A double standard
    that judges womenâ\x80\x99s\r\nbehavior, and their moral virtue, differently to
    menâ\x80\x99s. A\r\ndouble-standard that says that while menâ\x80\x99s reputations
    are rightly based\r\non moral virtues like honesty and integrity, womenâ\x80\x99s
    justly revolve\r\naround what they do or donâ\x80\x99t do in bed: on whether they
    are good girls,\r\nor sluts.\r\n\r\nThe past 30 years have provided women with
    greater opportunities to live\r\na life as varied and full as that lived by men.
    To be able to be not\r\nonly parents and partners, but employees as well. Along
    with this\r\nfreedom has come sexual freedom, important less because it gives
    women\r\ngreater licence in bed, but because it helped vanquish the notion that\r\nwhat
    women get up to in the sack matters in any assessment of their\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nTo
    a large extent, however, employment opportunities for women have been\r\nopened
    up without the necessary guarantees and supports. Women have been\r\nallowed to
    work (at roughly three-quarters of the male wage) as long as\r\nthey continued
    to uphold their previous responsibilities as wives and\r\nmothers.\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s
    an impossible task, but through the â\x80\x9980s working women - their\r\ncapes
    flying behind them - tried hard to make it work. When they were\r\nforced to confess
    defeat at the start of the â\x80\x9990s, they largely blamed\r\nthemselves (lack
    of organisation, stamina and honesty about the\r\ndifficulties were common themes).
    But the burial of the supermum myth\r\nhas not been accompanied by structural
    solutions to womenâ\x80\x99s predicament.\r\nTo the contrary, structurally and
    socially, things have become more\r\ndifficult, with childcare costs and unpredictable
    working hours both on\r\nthe rise.\r\n\r\nMy research on young childless women
    shows that working mothers are not\r\nthe only ones feeling confused and unsupported
    by these changes. Gen X\r\nwomen, for whom working is an assumption not a debate,
    are increasingly\r\nworried about their capacity to make a reality all parts of
    their\r\nimagined futures as employees, partners and mothers.\r\n\r\nThis, rather
    than how often they have sex, and with what number of\r\npartners, is the cause
    of any female malaise. For both women and men,\r\nsex is a small though important
    part of our lives: a part that has\r\nlittle to do with defining our characters
    or dictating our happiness.\r\n\r\nThe real problem young women face is twofold.
    Firstly, that the lives we\r\nhave and the lives we want contain too much responsibility
    and not\r\nenough social support. Secondly, that the analytical tools needed to\r\nsource
    responsibility for both the problem and the solution have been\r\nthrown out,
    in an understandable but damaging attempt to find solutions\r\nunique to our generation."
