    different religions, ethnic, racial, cultural, and linguistic\r\ngroups, and assisting
    them to maintain and share their knowledge,\r\nperspectives and cultures. Behind
    such claims is the unarticulated\r\npresumption that the only apects of culture
    that migrants seek to\r\npreserve, and to share with the wider community, are
    those Ayaan Hirsi\r\nAli recently described as [sentimental]() language, music,
    culinary\r\ntraditions and cultural and religious rituals.\r\n\r\nAustralians
    opposed to the intake of non-Anglo migrants and the respect\r\nafforded to such
    sentimental differences by cultural institutions like\r\nschools and governments
    - the yearly outcry against cr&egrave;ches that\r\ncelebrate multiple religious
    festivals in December rather than just\r\nChristmas is the classic - appear to
    be motivated by nothing more lofty\r\nthan racism, prejudice based on stereotype,
    ignorance, fear and\r\nxenophobia. This makes the short shrift supporters of multiculturalism\r\nhave
    given their concerns understandable and justified.\r\n\r\nBut events here and
    overseas have shown that some religious and cultural\r\nminorities in western
    countries like Australia - recent migrants and\r\ndenizens of longer lineage -
    have sought to maintain more than the\r\nsentimental aspects of their culture.
    Most confronting has been the\r\nhome-grown terrorists motivated by fanatical
    misogynist theocratic\r\nvalues brought from other lands. The London bombers,
    the 17 men arrested\r\nfor conspiring to storm the Canadian parliament and bomb
    power plants in\r\nOntario, the group of Sydney and Melbourne men charged with\r\nterrorism-related
    offences and Mohammed Bouyeri, the second generation\r\nDutch man who murdered
    progressive filmmaker Theo van Gogh all appeared\r\nto be motivated by a parallel
    set of values fundamentally at odds with\r\nthose central to western democratic
    societies. Values they felt strongly\r\nenough about to kill.\r\n\r\nAli, the
    Somali-born critic of Islam who was Bouyeriâ\x80\x99s next intended\r\ntarget,
    argues that western citizens cannot afford to tolerate\r\nsub-groups in the community
    with militant values that reject democracy\r\nand the rule of law, and privilege
    group entitlements and solidarity\r\nover individual rights. Tolerance of the
    intolerable, she suggests,\r\nleads to the grievous oppression of women and puts
    them, and the\r\ncommunity as a whole, at risk of violence.\r\n\r\nHer comments,
    made recently at the Commonwealth Club in California, were\r\nabout migrant communities,
    but they seem no less true when applied to\r\ncultural and religious sub-groups
    with Anglo roots or long lineages in\r\nAustralia. If migrant groups are rightly
    prohibited from mutilating the\r\ngenitals of their girls in the name of culture
    and religion, why should\r\nthe refusal of non- migrant religious groups to hire
    women for\r\nleadership positions because they are women or as teachers in their\r\nschools
    because they are unmarried - both clear violations of state and\r\nfederal anti-discrimination
    law - be allowed to stand? If we rail\r\nagainst the misogynist violence-condoning
    theology preached by migrant\r\nreligious leaders like Sheik Taj Din al-Hilali,
    why should we turn a\r\nblind a eye to the misogynist cant streaming from some
    fundamentalist\r\nChristian and Jewish pulpits?\r\n\r\nThe preservation by religious,
    ethnic and cultural minorities of their\r\nunique language, music, food, cultural
    and religious rituals - and the\r\nsharing of these differences with the wider
    community - has enriched,\r\nenlivened and enlarged Australian society. It is
    the positive fruits of\r\nAustralian multiculturalism of which we may feel justifiably
    proud.\r\n\r\nBut when minority groups preserve and seek to disseminate a parallel
    set\r\nof deep values that preach - and lead to the practice of - oppression or\r\nviolence
    against Australians within the group and outside of it, we have\r\na problem.
    It doesnâ\x80\x99t matter if those preaching oppression and violence\r\nhave an
    Anglo, or a long, lineage in Australia, of if they just arrived.\r\nWhat matters
    is the threat they pose to our security and the capacity of\r\nevery one of us,
    regardless of their gender or age, to exercise rights\r\nand freedoms guaranteed
    by law.\r\n\r\nSo where does this leave the rabbits, and those who wish to defend
    them,\r\nas electoral hunting season nears?\r\n\r\nNot, I believe, without ammunition
    or a warren to defend. Racism is\r\nunacceptable and the preservation and celebration
    of sentimental\r\ndifferences between peoples in democratic pluralist societies
    has and\r\nwill continue to be a key source of their vibrancy and success. These\r\ntruths
    are the foundation stones of multiculturalism.\r\n\r\nThe multicultural project
    is a sound one. We just need to know where to\r\ndraw the line."
