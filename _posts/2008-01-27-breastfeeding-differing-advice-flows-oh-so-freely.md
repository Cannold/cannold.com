    Inquiry into\r\nBreastfeeding has its way, the three that currently exist in NSW
    are set\r\nto mushroom.\r\n\r\nThe report is the most recent in a long line of
    official moans about the\r\nstubborn refusal of enough Australian mothers to conform
    to expert\r\nadvice that they feed their infants only breast milk for the first
    six\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to question the Committeeâ\x80\x99s unqualified
    assertion that\r\nevery one of the voluminous claims for the health benefits of\r\nbreastfeeding
    are proven. Last year, an Australian study found no basis\r\nfor medical advice
    that increasing the duration of breastfeeding and\r\ndelaying the introduction
    of solid foods prevented asthma or allergies.\r\n\r\nBut even if breastfeeding
    offered all the health benefits asserted by\r\nits proponents, itâ\x80\x99s not
    clear what this says about a womanâ\x80\x99s right to\r\ndecide how to feed her
    infant. Does the superiority of breast milk make\r\nbreastfeeding the best choice
    for every mother-infant dyad? Does it\r\nnegate the right of women to make informed,
    voluntary decisions about\r\nhow they feed their infants, and justify policies
    and practices that\r\nnudge, manipulate and ever coerce them into â\x80\x9Cchoosingâ\x80\x9D

    of\r\nâ\x80\x9Cprotect[ing], promot[ing] and support[ing] breastfeedingâ\x80\x9D
    says â\x80\x9Cyesâ\x80\x9D.\r\nIndeed, evidence to the Committee suggests women
    may already be\r\nsuffering from the programâ\x80\x99s heavy-handed approach,
    with mothers who\r\nused infant formula telling the Committee they felt upset
    at being\r\nâ\x80\x9Ctreated differently in hospitalâ\x80¦ pressured by health
    professionalsâ\x80\x99\r\nvoicing their opinion at their choice and [not being]
    provide[ed] infant\r\nformula in a timely mannerâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nDespite this,
    the Committee recommended the number of Baby-Friendly\r\nfacilities be increased,
    even though the accreditation standards\r\npractically require this sort of damaging
    and disrespectful behaviour.\r\nFor example, Baby-Friendly facilities must â\x80\x9Cinform
    all pregnant women\r\nabout the benefits and management of breastfeeding,â\x80\x9D
    â\x80\x9Cgive newborn\r\ninfants no food or drink other than breast milk unless
    medically\r\nindicated,â\x80\x9D and â\x80\x9Cgive no artificial teats or dummies
    to breastfeeding\r\ninfantsâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nWhile such demands may be consistent
    with the programâ\x80\x99s aim of\r\nâ\x80\x9Cincrease[ing] the initiation and
    duration of exclusive breastfeeding,â\x80\x9D\r\nthey run counter to the requirements
    of informed consent, which calls\r\nfor the disclosure of balanced information
    on both the risks and\r\nbenefits of all feeding options. They also show barely
    disguised\r\ncontempt for the right of women - not ward staff - to decide what
    to\r\ngive their infants when it comes to food and care.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that
    most breastfeeding advocates think informed consent is\r\nas useless as tits on
    a bull when it comes to infant feeding decisions.\r\nThis is because their goal
    is not to empower women to decide what is\r\nbest for them - based on their own
    needs and values - but to get as many\r\nwomen as possible to do what they believe
    is best for those womenâ\x80\x99s\r\nbabies, which is to be breastfed.\r\n\r\nThis
    is nothing new. There have always been medical practitioners and\r\nconservative
    womenâ\x80\x99s groups eager to spread their views about what is\r\nbest for other
    peopleâ\x80\x99s children and, consequently, what mothers must do\r\nto measure
    up.\r\n\r\nWhat is odd is the silence of feminists on this issue. Real choice,
    and\r\nrespect for women as choosers, requires not just that the structural\r\nconstraints
