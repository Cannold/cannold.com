    men into believing\r\nchildren are biologically theirs. But the truth is more
    complex, and\r\nmore human.\r\n\r\nWhile the DNA paternity test has been around
    since the early 1980s, it\r\nwas not until the midâ\x80\x931990s that the moral
    panic about what fatherâ\x80\x99s\r\nrights activists call â\x80\x9Cpaternity
    fraudâ\x80\x9D took flight in Australia.\r\nInstigated by the Child Support (Assessment)
    Act of 1989, the Act\r\neffectively transformed the age-old definition of a father:
    from the man\r\nmarried to a childâ\x80\x99s biological mother, to the man whose
    sperm caused\r\nthe child to be conceived. Designed to compel men to take fiscal\r\nresponsibility
    for the fruit of their loins, the new law was lauded by\r\npoliticians as a boon
    to both women and children.\r\n\r\nOvernight, the new law changed the world for
    separated and divorced men.\r\nWhile previous support arrangements had largely
    left such men in control\r\nof decisions about whether and to what extent they
    would provide\r\nfinancial support for the children of failed relationships ~~60%
    to 70%\r\nfound it easy to evade court-ordered maintenance and pay nothing~~ the\r\nnew
    act used set formulas to assign child support liabilities that could\r\nbe automatically
    deducted from a manâ\x80\x99s salary or from his bank account.\r\n\r\nThe only
    recourse for men hoping to escape what one commentator\r\nsympathetic to the Fatherâ\x80\x99s
    Rights cause recently referred to as the\r\nâ\x80\x9Cclutchesâ\x80\x9D of the
    Child Support Agency is to disprove biological\r\npaternity. So, perhaps not surprisingly,
    the Actâ\x80\x99s passage saw DNA labs\r\nbloom across the commercial landscape
    like desert flowers, marketing\r\npaternal anxiety to men and promising â\x80\x9Cpeace
    of mindâ\x80\x9D from between $150\r\nto $825 (if you want the results to stand
    up in court). By early 2000,\r\nFatherâ\x80\x99s Rights Groups were insisting
    on the basis of discredited or\r\neven non-existent data sets that between 10
    to 30% of Australian\r\nchildren were being parented by men who were not the biological
    father,\r\nand viciously attacking academics - like Swinburneâ\x80\x99s Professor
    Michael\r\nGilding - who tried to set the record straight (Gildingâ\x80\x99s published\r\nresults
    showing the Australian rate is likely to be between 1 and 3%).\r\n\r\nThe Australian
    face of paternity fraud is Melbourne man Liam Magill. In\r\n2002, Magillâ\x80\x99s
    ex-wife Meredith was ordered to pay him $70,000 for\r\ngeneral damages and the
    economic loss he suffered as a consequence of\r\nher false declaration that he
    was, as one newspaper report put it, the\r\nbiological father of â\x80\x9Cher
    loverâ\x80\x99s childrenâ\x80\x9D. The case continues to fight\r\nits way through
    the courts, with the High Court of Australia last week\r\ngranting Mr Magill leave
    to contest the Victorian Supreme Courtâ\x80\x99s\r\nreversal of his victory and
    continue his case for compensation. But,\r\nhowever the highest court in the land
    ultimately rules, Magillâ\x80\x99s\r\npredicament - and the anxieties of fathers
    over legally intertwined\r\nquestions of biological paternity and fiscal responsibility
    - have had a\r\nprofound impact on government policy. In June this year, the\r\nAttorney-General
    Philip Ruddock amended the Family Law Act to make it\r\neasier for men to reclaim
    child maintenance or property transferred to a\r\nchild that DNA testing reveals
    isnâ\x80\x99t really â\x80\x9Ctheirsâ\x80\x9D. Around the same\r\ntime, the Government
    took delivery of what has become known as the\r\nParkinson report which recommends
    that men disputing biological\r\npaternity be allowed to suspend child support
    payments for as long as it\r\ntakes to resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nIt is men - or
    what President of the Australian Law Reform Commission\r\nProfessor David Weisbrot
    calls â\x80\x9Cputativeâ\x80\x9D and â\x80\x9Cangry dadsâ\x80\x99 - that\r\ndominate
    debates about child support and paternity fraud. While their\r\nbitter denunciations
    of women whoâ\x80\x9Dcheat and lie\" echo through\r\ncyber-space, in real life
    such men contribute the bulk of submissions to\r\nthe ALRCâ\x80\x99s recent inquiry
    into the privacy of genetic information and,\r\nthrough their endless complaints
    to local MPs, instigate inquires like\r\nthe 2003 one into child custody arrangements
    that ultimately led to the\r\nParkinson report. The voices of children and women
    are rarely heard.\r\nIndeed, even in the wake of her victory in the Victorian
    Supreme Court,\r\nMeredith Magill refused to grant interviews to any of the assembled\r\nreporters.\r\n\r\nThe
    work of Dr Lyn Turney, a researcher at Swinburne, suggests that this\r\nis not
    surprising. Turneyâ\x80\x99s groundbreaking research on women who keep\r\nâ\x80\x9Cpaternity
    secrets,â\x80\x9D which appeared in the most recent issue of the\r\nJournal of
    Family Studies, argues that the panic surrounding paternity\r\nfraud paints mothers
    as the central â\x80\x9Cmoral threatâ\x80\x9D to social stability.\r\nCharged
    as sexual deviants for the dual â\x80\x9Ccrimesâ\x80\x9D of infidelity and\r\nsluttishly
    having more than one partner - while posing in the community\r\nas â\x80\x9Cgoodâ\x80\x9D
    wives and mothers - the behaviour of such women is depicted as\r\nmorally indefensible.
    Says Turney: â\x80\x9CThey encapsulate not only female\r\nsexuality out of control
    but also a view of women as predatory,\r\ndeceptive, and instrumentalâ\x80\x9D.
    No wonder they donâ\x80\x99t want to stick their\r\nheads above the parapet.\r\n\r\nBut
    Turney wanted to know more. In particular, what led women to have\r\nand to keep
    â\x80\x9Cpaternity secretsâ\x80\x9D? Her results, the outcome of interviews\r\nwith
    15 Australian women, are testament to the stubborn opacity of\r\nconception, the
    complexity of human relationships and the way in which\r\nboth shame and violence
    shape womenâ\x80\x99s sexual and reproductive lives.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, Kathleen
    Donnelly, the past girlfriend of Health\r\nMinister Tony Abbott who publicly -
    and mistakenly - declared him the\r\nfather of their long-ago adopted son, is
    not the only Australian woman\r\nto be confused about the genetic paternity of
    her offspring. In Turneyâ\x80\x99s\r\nsample, a number of women admitted to uncertainty
    about which man was\r\nthe genetic father of their child.\r\n\r\nBut few of these
    womenâ\x80\x99s stories conformed to the â\x80\x9Cpaternity fraudâ\x80\x9D\r\nstereotype
    of faithless wives with regular lovers. Instead, the women\r\nTurney interviewed
    told of sexual relationships that â\x80\x9Coverlappedâ\x80\x9D or\r\nhappened
    â\x80\x9Cin quick succession,â\x80\x9D as well as â\x80\x9Cone-offâ\x80\x9D encounters
    with\r\nfriends, acquaintance and old-flames that usually didnâ\x80\x99t involve
    either\r\ninfidelity or deception because the women were either unattached or
    only\r\nâ\x80\x9Cminimally attachedâ\x80\x9D to a dying, old or embryonic relationship
    at the\r\ntime. One woman, for example, had unplanned sex with a long-time friend:\r\nher
    first encounter after the death of her husband a year earlier.\r\nSeveral days
    later, she met a new man who became her regular partner.\r\nAnother woman told
    of a single sexual liaison with an old flame while\r\nsingle and trying to conceive
    a child with a known-donor. Both of these\r\nwomen, as well as others to whom
    Turney spoke, had dismissed the\r\nreproductive potential of these one-off encounters
    because they wanted\r\nto believe that their chosen or permanent partner - the
    one with whom\r\nthey were having regular unprotected sex - was the genetic father.
    It\r\nwas only when the baby bore a similarity to the biological father at\r\nbirth,
    or the woman later happened upon a childhood photograph of the\r\nbiological father,
    that the connection was made and the biological\r\nrealities of the situation
    accepted.\r\n\r\nThe threat of sexual violence or shaming also explains a number
    of cases\r\nof â\x80\x9Cpaternity fraudâ\x80\x9D. Several women, some of whom
    confessed\r\nstomach-turning tales of rape and abuse, withheld doubts about their\r\nchildâ\x80\x99s
    paternity for fear of their partnersâ\x80\x99 response. One woman told\r\nof being
    raped by a family friend and, believing herself to be at fault\r\nbecause she
    â\x80\x9Ctrusted himâ\x80\x9D, never told anyone of the assault or her\r\nsubsequent
    doubts about paternity.\r\n\r\nTurney also cites several instances where older
    domineering husbands\r\norganized sexual liaisons - in the context of an â\x80\x9Copen
    marriageâ\x80\x9D and\r\nplenty of drugs and alcohol - in which their wives participated.
    When\r\nthe women subsequently raised questions about the paternity of resulting\r\nchildren,
    the husbands â\x80\x9Cmutedâ\x80\x9D the discussion by â\x80\x9Chighlighting the\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99sâ\x80¦sexual
    transgressionsâ\x80\x9D and threatening them with public\r\ndisclosure. Such men
    â\x80\x9Cdrew upon the moral panic,â\x80\x9D in other words, to\r\nstop the woman
    revealing the secret about the childâ\x80\x99s paternity not to\r\nthe social
    father - who knew exactly what was going on - but to society\r\nat large. Only
    when the relationship broke down, and the question of\r\nsupport payments arose,
    did the men question the childâ\x80\x99s biological\r\npaternity.\r\n\r\nAbortion
    was considered by several women unsure about which man caused\r\ntheir pregnancy,
    but the men in their lives were not always supportive.\r\nThe Catholic step-father
    of a 16 year-old told her he would never speak\r\nto her again if she had an abortion,
    while a GP to whom another woman\r\nconfessed her lack of paternity certainty
    counselled her to â\x80\x9Cgo ahead\r\nwith the pregnancy and see what happensâ\x80\x9D.
    In one instance, the\r\nsuggestion of abortion triggered an angry response from
    the womanâ\x80\x99s\r\npartner because she was threatening to â\x80\x9Ckill [a]
    baby that was probably\r\nhisâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge that some â\x80\x9Cdefraudedâ\x80\x9D
    dads have about womenâ\x80\x99s paternity\r\nâ\x80\x9Csecretsâ\x80\x99 is perhaps
    the most important - and surprising - of Turneyâ\x80\x99s\r\nfindings. From the
    wife-swapping husband, to the abortion-opposing\r\npartner, to the spouse who
    knew his wife had conceived during a short\r\nbreak in their relationship yet
    nonetheless chose to sign the birth\r\nregistration papers and act in the role
    of the childâ\x80\x99s father, Turney\r\nexposes a range of scenarios where the
    wordâ\x80\x9Dfraud\" poorly describe what\r\nthe men involved describe as the
    problem they face, if indeed they\r\ndefine their situation as problematic at
    all. For one man, the issue was\r\nthat his partner was unfaithful, not that the
    resulting child wasnâ\x80\x99t\r\nbiologically â\x80\x9Chisâ\x80\x9D. However,
    in explaining his refusal to have a\r\npaternity test, the ex-partner of another
    woman said that while he was\r\nâ\x80\x9Cover the fact the [she had] slept with
    some else,â\x80\x9D he hadnâ\x80\x99t come to\r\nterms with the potential genetic
    consequences of her actions.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Turneyâ\x80\x99s revelation that some
    men know there are doubts about\r\ntheir childrenâ\x80\x99s genetic lineage or
    even that their children are\r\ndefinitely not biologically â\x80\x9Ctheirsâ\x80\x9D
    bolsters suggestions - rife in the\r\nacademic literature - that relationship
    breakdown is an important\r\ntrigger to menâ\x80\x99s (and consequently societyâ\x80\x99s)
    reworking of paternity\r\nâ\x80\x9Csecretsâ\x80\x9D into the moral crime of paternity
    â\x80\x9Cfraud.â\x80\x9D It also hints at\r\nthe unsavory possibility, vehemently
    rejected by Fatherâ\x80\x99s Rights groups,\r\nthat at least some men are motivated
    to test - in the wake of marital\r\nbreakdown - to escape child support liabilities.\r\n\r\nThe
    take home message of Turneyâ\x80\x99s research is simple, yet consistently\r\noverlooked
    in debates about paternity fraud. That human values, motives\r\nand relationships
    come in a myriad of complex - even convoluted - forms.\r\nâ\x80\x9COh, what a
    tangled web we weaveâ\x80\x9D, I wanted to sigh as each womanâ\x80\x99s tale\r\n-
    with its coercion and choice, misunderstanding and deception, care and\r\nindifference
    - unfolded. I also found Turneyâ\x80\x99s work suggestive of a\r\nnumber of ways
    the problem of paternity fraud could be understood, and\r\nfixed.\r\n\r\nWhat
    is clear is that it is a nonsense to brand all instances in which\r\nmen receive
    paternity test results showing they are not a childâ\x80\x99s\r\nbiological father
    as cases of â\x80\x9Cpaternity fraudâ\x80\x9D. As Turneyâ\x80\x99s research\r\nshows,
    such results may - or may not - be telling the man something he\r\ndidnâ\x80\x99t
    know already. Fraud implies deceit and if men know there is doubt\r\nabout a childâ\x80\x99s
    genetic paternity or are sure a child is not their\r\nbiological progeny - and
    have supported the pregnancy continuing (for\r\ninstance, by opposing an abortion)
    - then it is simply incorrect to\r\nclaim that they have duped either about their
    partnerâ\x80\x99s fidelity or into\r\naccepting legal responsibility for the child.\r\n\r\nBy
    definition, a victim of fraud is someone who has been injured, or at\r\nleast
    disadvantaged. To be defrauded is to be cheated of something that\r\nis rightfully
    yours. Indeed, the claim that â\x80\x9Crealâ\x80\x9D Dads are genetic\r\nones,
    and therefore that men who discover they are not the progenitor of\r\nthe child
    they are parenting have been cheated of fatherhood, is at the\r\nheart of Fatherâ\x80\x99s
    Rights Groups claims about the wrongs suffered by\r\nvictims of paternity fraud.
    Yet, research evidence, not to mention the\r\ndecisions of millions of men to
    adopt children or conceive them using\r\ndonor sperm, suggest that many men see
    the essence of fatherhood as\r\nparenting, not sperm-donation. For them, the â\x80\x9Crealâ\x80\x9D
    father is the one\r\nwho is â\x80\x9Cthereâ\x80\x9D not at the time of conception,
    but for the joys and hard\r\nwork of parenting.\r\n\r\nOf course, many - if not
    most - men want to be both the genetic and the\r\nsocial father of their child.
    Were this not the case, chastity belts\r\nwould never have been invented, nor
    the debilitating laws and attitudes\r\nthat until recently condemned â\x80\x9Cunwed
    mothersâ\x80\x9D and their â\x80\x9Cbastardâ\x80\x9D\r\nchildren to legal and
    social non-personhood. When women keep paternity\r\nsecrets, they deprive men
    of the knowledge that would instigate an\r\nexploration of their values regarding
    social and genetic fatherhood, and\r\nthe chance to make partnering and parenting
    choices based on those\r\nvalues. Paternity secrets deprive men of the chance
    to say â\x80\x9Cthanks but\r\nno thanksâ\x80\x9D to an offer of social, but not
    biological, fatherhood.\r\n\r\nAll this cashes out to a definition of the problem
    that focuses on the\r\nabuse of trust caused by infidelity and subsequent deception
    about the\r\ninfidelity, and the consequent denial to men of the chance to make\r\ninformed
    decisions about partnering and parenting. Such a definition\r\ndoes not make the
    parenting of an unrelated child a quandary in and of\r\nitself, but only one in
    the context of a lack of female honesty and\r\ninformed decision-making by the
    man. The difficulty is not the return of\r\nDNA results that show a social father
    is not a biological one, but the\r\nreturn of such results to a man who did not
    know there was any doubt\r\nabout his partnerâ\x80\x99s sexual fidelity and his
    genetic paternity. The\r\ntrouble is the discrepancy between what men believe
    is the case about\r\ntheir partnerâ\x80\x99s fidelity and genetic paternity, and
    the reality. The\r\nproblem isnâ\x80\x99t paternity fraud. The problem is paternal
    discrepancy.\r\n\r\nWhat all this should make clear is that the current child
    support\r\npayment system, which assigns payment obligations on the basis of\r\nbiological
    paternity, not parenting commitment, is tragically flawed.\r\nRegardless of whether
    or not he suspected, knew or had no idea that the\r\nchild he was parenting was
    genetically unrelated, and notwithstanding\r\nhowever culpable his female partnerâ\x80\x99s
    behavior was in creating that\r\nsituation, the law needs to recognize and affirm
    menâ\x80\x99s value to children\r\nas parents - and people - not sperm donors.
    Playing the biological card\r\nnot only undercuts research findings that affirm
    the importance to\r\nchildren of having an active male parent in their lives,
    but lends\r\nsupport to the insulting claim made by a sperm donor interviewed
    on Four\r\nCorners last month that he, not the man who invested 20 years of time\r\nand
    love, was his daughterâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9Crealâ\x80\x9D father.\r\n\r\nDitto for
    recent suggestions that DNA paternity testing ought to be made\r\ncompulsory at
    birth. Turneyâ\x80\x99s research makes it easy to imagine the man\r\nwho suspects
    or even knows that his new bundle of joy is not a\r\nbiological relation compelled
    to face a doctor or nurse delivering the\r\nâ\x80\x9Cnegativeâ\x80\x9D results
    of a mandatory paternity test. How likely is such a\r\nman to admit to knowing
    and not caring about the sexual and biological\r\nrealities surrounding his childâ\x80\x99s
    conception if he feels this will brand\r\nhim as cuckold and a mug? Better, he
    may feel, to beat his chest, cry\r\nfoul and walk out on his wife and new baby.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, rejecting mandatory paternity testing at birth does not mean\r\nthat men
    should not be assisted to accept the obligations of fatherhood\r\nin a more informed
    way. Upon the birth of a child, men ought to be given\r\nthe opportunity to give
    one-time-only non-rescindable consent to their\r\nacceptance of the rights and
    responsibilities of fatherhood. If they\r\nfeel unable to sign on the dotted line
    without conclusive proof that\r\nthey are the biological progenitor, they should
    be offered a DNA test\r\nfree of charge.\r\n\r\nHowever, once a man does formally
    accept social and legal responsibility\r\nfor a child - either with knowledge
    of their genetic paternity or in the\r\nface of a fully informed waiver of that
    knowledge - their status as the\r\nchildâ\x80\x99s legal father should rightly
    be set in stone. No DNA skeletons\r\nrattling out of the cupboards at a later
    date should impact on what they\r\nlegally owe their child, or hopefully, how
    they feel about the kid who\r\ncalls him Dad.\r\n\r\nDr Leslie Cannold is a bioethicist
    at the University of Melbourneâ\x80\x99s\r\nCentre for Applied Philosophy and
    Public Ethics who regularly researches\r\nand writes about reproductive choice.

    calls â\x80\x9Cputativeâ\x80\x9D and â\x80\x9Cangry dadsâ\x80\x99 &ndash; that\ndominate
    debates about child support and paternity fraud. While their\nbitter denunciations
    of women whoâ\x80\x9Dcheat and lie\" echo through\ncyber-space, in real life such
    men contribute the bulk of submissions to\nthe ALRCâ\x80\x99s recent inquiry into
    the privacy of genetic information and,\nthrough their endless complaints to local
    MPs, instigate inquires like\nthe 2003 one into child custody arrangements that
    ultimately led to the\nParkinson report. The voices of children and women are
    rarely heard.\nIndeed, even in the wake of her victory in the Victorian Supreme
    Court,\nMeredith Magill refused to grant interviews to any of the assembled\nreporters.</p>\n\n<p>The
    work of Dr Lyn Turney, a researcher at Swinburne, suggests that this\nis not surprising.
    Turneyâ\x80\x99s groundbreaking research on women who keep\nâ\x80\x9Cpaternity
    secrets,â\x80\x9D which appeared in the most recent issue of the\nJournal of Family
    Studies, argues that the panic surrounding paternity\nfraud paints mothers as
    the central â\x80\x9Cmoral threatâ\x80\x9D to social stability.\nCharged as sexual
    deviants for the dual â\x80\x9Ccrimesâ\x80\x9D of infidelity and\nsluttishly having
    more than one partner &ndash; while posing in the community\nas â\x80\x9Cgoodâ\x80\x9D
    wives and mothers &ndash; the behaviour of such women is depicted as\nmorally
    indefensible. Says Turney: â\x80\x9CThey encapsulate not only female\nsexuality
    out of control but also a view of women as predatory,\ndeceptive, and instrumentalâ\x80\x9D.
    No wonder they donâ\x80\x99t want to stick their\nheads above the parapet.</p>\n\n<p>But
    Turney wanted to know more. In particular, what led women to have\nand to keep
    â\x80\x9Cpaternity secretsâ\x80\x9D? Her results, the outcome of interviews\nwith
    15 Australian women, are testament to the stubborn opacity of\nconception, the
    complexity of human relationships and the way in which\nboth shame and violence
    shape womenâ\x80\x99s sexual and reproductive lives.</p>\n\n<p>As it turns out,
    Kathleen Donnelly, the past girlfriend of Health\nMinister Tony Abbott who publicly
    &ndash; and mistakenly &ndash; declared him the\nfather of their long-ago adopted
    son, is not the only Australian woman\nto be confused about the genetic paternity
    of her offspring. In Turneyâ\x80\x99s\nsample, a number of women admitted to uncertainty
    about which man was\nthe genetic father of their child.</p>\n\n<p>But few of these
    womenâ\x80\x99s stories conformed to the â\x80\x9Cpaternity fraudâ\x80\x9D\nstereotype
    of faithless wives with regular lovers. Instead, the women\nTurney interviewed
    told of sexual relationships that â\x80\x9Coverlappedâ\x80\x9D or\nhappened â\x80\x9Cin
    quick succession,â\x80\x9D as well as â\x80\x9Cone-offâ\x80\x9D encounters with\nfriends,
    acquaintance and old-flames that usually didnâ\x80\x99t involve either\ninfidelity
    or deception because the women were either unattached or only\nâ\x80\x9Cminimally
    attachedâ\x80\x9D to a dying, old or embryonic relationship at the\ntime. One
    woman, for example, had unplanned sex with a long-time friend:\nher first encounter
    after the death of her husband a year earlier.\nSeveral days later, she met a
    new man who became her regular partner.\nAnother woman told of a single sexual
    liaison with an old flame while\nsingle and trying to conceive a child with a
    known-donor. Both of these\nwomen, as well as others to whom Turney spoke, had
    dismissed the\nreproductive potential of these one-off encounters because they
    wanted\nto believe that their chosen or permanent partner &ndash; the one with
    whom\nthey were having regular unprotected sex &ndash; was the genetic father.
    It\nwas only when the baby bore a similarity to the biological father at\nbirth,
    or the woman later happened upon a childhood photograph of the\nbiological father,
    that the connection was made and the biological\nrealities of the situation accepted.</p>\n\n<p>The
    threat of sexual violence or shaming also explains a number of cases\nof â\x80\x9Cpaternity
    fraudâ\x80\x9D. Several women, some of whom confessed\nstomach-turning tales of
    rape and abuse, withheld doubts about their\nchildâ\x80\x99s paternity for fear
    of their partnersâ\x80\x99 response. One woman told\nof being raped by a family
    friend and, believing herself to be at fault\nbecause she â\x80\x9Ctrusted himâ\x80\x9D,
    never told anyone of the assault or her\nsubsequent doubts about paternity.</p>\n\n<p>Turney
    also cites several instances where older domineering husbands\norganized sexual
    liaisons &ndash; in the context of an â\x80\x9Copen marriageâ\x80\x9D and\nplenty
    of drugs and alcohol &ndash; in which their wives participated. When\nthe women
    subsequently raised questions about the paternity of resulting\nchildren, the
    husbands â\x80\x9Cmutedâ\x80\x9D the discussion by â\x80\x9Chighlighting the\nwomenâ\x80\x99sâ\x80¦sexual
    transgressionsâ\x80\x9D and threatening them with public\ndisclosure. Such men
    â\x80\x9Cdrew upon the moral panic,â\x80\x9D in other words, to\nstop the woman
    revealing the secret about the childâ\x80\x99s paternity not to\nthe social father
    &ndash; who knew exactly what was going on &ndash; but to society\nat large. Only
    when the relationship broke down, and the question of\nsupport payments arose,
    did the men question the childâ\x80\x99s biological\npaternity.</p>\n\n<p>Abortion
    was considered by several women unsure about which man caused\ntheir pregnancy,
    but the men in their lives were not always supportive.\nThe Catholic step-father
    of a 16 year-old told her he would never speak\nto her again if she had an abortion,
    while a GP to whom another woman\nconfessed her lack of paternity certainty counselled
    her to â\x80\x9Cgo ahead\nwith the pregnancy and see what happensâ\x80\x9D. In
    one instance, the\nsuggestion of abortion triggered an angry response from the
    womanâ\x80\x99s\npartner because she was threatening to â\x80\x9Ckill [a] baby
    that was probably\nhisâ\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n<p>The knowledge that some â\x80\x9Cdefraudedâ\x80\x9D
    dads have about womenâ\x80\x99s paternity\nâ\x80\x9Csecretsâ\x80\x99 is perhaps
    the most important &ndash; and surprising &ndash; of Turneyâ\x80\x99s\nfindings.
    From the wife-swapping husband, to the abortion-opposing\npartner, to the spouse
    who knew his wife had conceived during a short\nbreak in their relationship yet
    nonetheless chose to sign the birth\nregistration papers and act in the role of
    the childâ\x80\x99s father, Turney\nexposes a range of scenarios where the wordâ\x80\x9Dfraud\"
    poorly describe what\nthe men involved describe as the problem they face, if indeed
    they\ndefine their situation as problematic at all. For one man, the issue was\nthat
    his partner was unfaithful, not that the resulting child wasnâ\x80\x99t\nbiologically
    â\x80\x9Chisâ\x80\x9D. However, in explaining his refusal to have a\npaternity
    test, the ex-partner of another woman said that while he was\nâ\x80\x9Cover the
    fact the [she had] slept with some else,â\x80\x9D he hadnâ\x80\x99t come to\nterms
    with the potential genetic consequences of her actions.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, Turneyâ\x80\x99s
    revelation that some men know there are doubts about\ntheir childrenâ\x80\x99s
    genetic lineage or even that their children are\ndefinitely not biologically â\x80\x9Ctheirsâ\x80\x9D
    bolsters suggestions &ndash; rife in the\nacademic literature &ndash; that relationship
    breakdown is an important\ntrigger to menâ\x80\x99s (and consequently societyâ\x80\x99s)
    reworking of paternity\nâ\x80\x9Csecretsâ\x80\x9D into the moral crime of paternity
    â\x80\x9Cfraud.â\x80\x9D It also hints at\nthe unsavory possibility, vehemently
    rejected by Fatherâ\x80\x99s Rights groups,\nthat at least some men are motivated
    to test &ndash; in the wake of marital\nbreakdown &ndash; to escape child support
    liabilities.</p>\n\n<p>The take home message of Turneyâ\x80\x99s research is simple,
    yet consistently\noverlooked in debates about paternity fraud. That human values,
    motives\nand relationships come in a myriad of complex &ndash; even convoluted
    &ndash; forms.\nâ\x80\x9COh, what a tangled web we weaveâ\x80\x9D, I wanted to
    sigh as each womanâ\x80\x99s tale\n&ndash; with its coercion and choice, misunderstanding
    and deception, care and\nindifference &ndash; unfolded. I also found Turneyâ\x80\x99s
    work suggestive of a\nnumber of ways the problem of paternity fraud could be understood,
    and\nfixed.</p>\n\n<p>What is clear is that it is a nonsense to brand all instances
    in which\nmen receive paternity test results showing they are not a childâ\x80\x99s\nbiological
    father as cases of â\x80\x9Cpaternity fraudâ\x80\x9D. As Turneyâ\x80\x99s research\nshows,
    such results may &ndash; or may not &ndash; be telling the man something he\ndidnâ\x80\x99t
    know already. Fraud implies deceit and if men know there is doubt\nabout a childâ\x80\x99s
    genetic paternity or are sure a child is not their\nbiological progeny &ndash;
    and have supported the pregnancy continuing (for\ninstance, by opposing an abortion)
    &ndash; then it is simply incorrect to\nclaim that they have duped either about
    their partnerâ\x80\x99s fidelity or into\naccepting legal responsibility for the
    child.</p>\n\n<p>By definition, a victim of fraud is someone who has been injured,
    or at\nleast disadvantaged. To be defrauded is to be cheated of something that\nis
    rightfully yours. Indeed, the claim that â\x80\x9Crealâ\x80\x9D Dads are genetic\nones,
    and therefore that men who discover they are not the progenitor of\nthe child
    they are parenting have been cheated of fatherhood, is at the\nheart of Fatherâ\x80\x99s
    Rights Groups claims about the wrongs suffered by\nvictims of paternity fraud.
    Yet, research evidence, not to mention the\ndecisions of millions of men to adopt
    children or conceive them using\ndonor sperm, suggest that many men see the essence
    of fatherhood as\nparenting, not sperm-donation. For them, the â\x80\x9Crealâ\x80\x9D
    father is the one\nwho is â\x80\x9Cthereâ\x80\x9D not at the time of conception,
    but for the joys and hard\nwork of parenting.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, many &ndash;
    if not most &ndash; men want to be both the genetic and the\nsocial father of
    their child. Were this not the case, chastity belts\nwould never have been invented,
    nor the debilitating laws and attitudes\nthat until recently condemned â\x80\x9Cunwed
    mothersâ\x80\x9D and their â\x80\x9Cbastardâ\x80\x9D\nchildren to legal and social
    non-personhood. When women keep paternity\nsecrets, they deprive men of the knowledge
    that would instigate an\nexploration of their values regarding social and genetic
    fatherhood, and\nthe chance to make partnering and parenting choices based on
    those\nvalues. Paternity secrets deprive men of the chance to say â\x80\x9Cthanks
    but\nno thanksâ\x80\x9D to an offer of social, but not biological, fatherhood.</p>\n\n<p>All
    this cashes out to a definition of the problem that focuses on the\nabuse of trust
    caused by infidelity and subsequent deception about the\ninfidelity, and the consequent
    denial to men of the chance to make\ninformed decisions about partnering and parenting.
    Such a definition\ndoes not make the parenting of an unrelated child a quandary
    in and of\nitself, but only one in the context of a lack of female honesty and\ninformed
    decision-making by the man. The difficulty is not the return of\nDNA results that
    show a social father is not a biological one, but the\nreturn of such results
    to a man who did not know there was any doubt\nabout his partnerâ\x80\x99s sexual
    fidelity and his genetic paternity. The\ntrouble is the discrepancy between what
    men believe is the case about\ntheir partnerâ\x80\x99s fidelity and genetic paternity,
    and the reality. The\nproblem isnâ\x80\x99t paternity fraud. The problem is paternal
    discrepancy.</p>\n\n<p>What all this should make clear is that the current child
    support\npayment system, which assigns payment obligations on the basis of\nbiological
    paternity, not parenting commitment, is tragically flawed.\nRegardless of whether
    or not he suspected, knew or had no idea that the\nchild he was parenting was
    genetically unrelated, and notwithstanding\nhowever culpable his female partnerâ\x80\x99s
    behavior was in creating that\nsituation, the law needs to recognize and affirm
    menâ\x80\x99s value to children\nas parents &ndash; and people &ndash; not sperm
    donors. Playing the biological card\nnot only undercuts research findings that
    affirm the importance to\nchildren of having an active male parent in their lives,
    but lends\nsupport to the insulting claim made by a sperm donor interviewed on
    Four\nCorners last month that he, not the man who invested 20 years of time\nand
    love, was his daughterâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9Crealâ\x80\x9D father.</p>\n\n<p>Ditto
    for recent suggestions that DNA paternity testing ought to be made\ncompulsory
    at birth. Turneyâ\x80\x99s research makes it easy to imagine the man\nwho suspects
    or even knows that his new bundle of joy is not a\nbiological relation compelled
    to face a doctor or nurse delivering the\nâ\x80\x9Cnegativeâ\x80\x9D results of
    a mandatory paternity test. How likely is such a\nman to admit to knowing and
    not caring about the sexual and biological\nrealities surrounding his childâ\x80\x99s
    conception if he feels this will brand\nhim as cuckold and a mug? Better, he may
    feel, to beat his chest, cry\nfoul and walk out on his wife and new baby.</p>\n\n<p>Of
    course, rejecting mandatory paternity testing at birth does not mean\nthat men
    should not be assisted to accept the obligations of fatherhood\nin a more informed
    way. Upon the birth of a child, men ought to be given\nthe opportunity to give
    one-time-only non-rescindable consent to their\nacceptance of the rights and responsibilities
    of fatherhood. If they\nfeel unable to sign on the dotted line without conclusive
    proof that\nthey are the biological progenitor, they should be offered a DNA test\nfree
    of charge.</p>\n\n<p>However, once a man does formally accept social and legal
    responsibility\nfor a child &ndash; either with knowledge of their genetic paternity
    or in the\nface of a fully informed waiver of that knowledge &ndash; their status
    as the\nchildâ\x80\x99s legal father should rightly be set in stone. No DNA skeletons\nrattling
    out of the cupboards at a later date should impact on what they\nlegally owe their
    child, or hopefully, how they feel about the kid who\ncalls him Dad.</p>\n\n<p>Dr

title: Paternity Fraud or Paternal Discrepancy?
--- "â\x80\x9CPaternity Fraudâ\x80\x9D implies deceptive women cuckholding men into
  believing\r\nchildren are biologically theirs. But the truth is more complex, and\r\nmore
  human.\r\n\r\nWhile the DNA paternity test has been around since the early 1980s,
  it\r\nwas not until the midâ\x80\x931990s that the moral panic about what fatherâ\x80\x99s\r\nrights
  activists call â\x80\x9Cpaternity fraudâ\x80\x9D took flight in Australia.\r\nInstigated
  by the Child Support (Assessment) Act of 1989, the Act\r\neffectively transformed
  the age-old definition of a father: from the man\r\nmarried to a childâ\x80\x99s
  biological mother, to the man whose sperm caused\r\nthe child to be conceived. Designed
  to compel men to take fiscal\r\nresponsibility for the fruit of their loins, the
  new law was lauded by\r\npoliticians as a boon to both women and children.\r\n\r\nOvernight,
  the new law changed the world for separated and divorced men.\r\nWhile previous
  support arrangements had largely left such men in control\r\nof decisions about
  whether and to what extent they would provide\r\nfinancial support for the children
  of failed relationships ~~60% to 70%\r\nfound it easy to evade court-ordered maintenance
  and pay nothing~~ the\r\nnew act used set formulas to assign child support liabilities
  that could\r\nbe automatically deducted from a manâ\x80\x99s salary or from his
  bank account.\r\n\r\nThe only recourse for men hoping to escape what one commentator\r\nsympathetic
  to the Fatherâ\x80\x99s Rights cause recently referred to as the\r\nâ\x80\x9Cclutchesâ\x80\x9D
  of the Child Support Agency is to disprove biological\r\npaternity. So, perhaps
  not surprisingly, the Actâ\x80\x99s passage saw DNA labs\r\nbloom across the commercial
  landscape like desert flowers, marketing\r\npaternal anxiety to men and promising
  â\x80\x9Cpeace of mindâ\x80\x9D from between $150\r\nto $825 (if you want the results
  to stand up in court). By early 2000,\r\nFatherâ\x80\x99s Rights Groups were insisting
  on the basis of discredited or\r\neven non-existent data sets that between 10 to
  30% of Australian\r\nchildren were being parented by men who were not the biological
  father,\r\nand viciously attacking academics - like Swinburneâ\x80\x99s Professor
  Michael\r\nGilding - who tried to set the record straight (Gildingâ\x80\x99s published\r\nresults
  showing the Australian rate is likely to be between 1 and 3%).\r\n\r\nThe Australian
  face of paternity fraud is Melbourne man Liam Magill. In\r\n2002, Magillâ\x80\x99s
  ex-wife Meredith was ordered to pay him $70,000 for\r\ngeneral damages and the economic
  loss he suffered as a consequence of\r\nher false declaration that he was, as one
  newspaper report put it, the\r\nbiological father of â\x80\x9Cher loverâ\x80\x99s
  childrenâ\x80\x9D. The case continues to fight\r\nits way through the courts, with
  the High Court of Australia last week\r\ngranting Mr Magill leave to contest the
  Victorian Supreme Courtâ\x80\x99s\r\nreversal of his victory and continue his case
  for compensation. But,\r\nhowever the highest court in the land ultimately rules,
  Magillâ\x80\x99s\r\npredicament - and the anxieties of fathers over legally intertwined\r\nquestions
  of biological paternity and fiscal responsibility - have had a\r\nprofound impact
  on government policy. In June this year, the\r\nAttorney-General Philip Ruddock
  amended the Family Law Act to make it\r\neasier for men to reclaim child maintenance
  or property transferred to a\r\nchild that DNA testing reveals isnâ\x80\x99t really
  â\x80\x9Ctheirsâ\x80\x9D. Around the same\r\ntime, the Government took delivery
  of what has become known as the\r\nParkinson report which recommends that men disputing
  biological\r\npaternity be allowed to suspend child support payments for as long
  as it\r\ntakes to resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nIt is men - or what President of the
  Australian Law Reform Commission\r\nProfessor David Weisbrot calls â\x80\x9Cputativeâ\x80\x9D
  and â\x80\x9Cangry dadsâ\x80\x99 - that\r\ndominate debates about child support
  and paternity fraud. While their\r\nbitter denunciations of women whoâ\x80\x9Dcheat
  and lie\" echo through\r\ncyber-space, in real life such men contribute the bulk
  of submissions to\r\nthe ALRCâ\x80\x99s recent inquiry into the privacy of genetic
  information and,\r\nthrough their endless complaints to local MPs, instigate inquires
  like\r\nthe 2003 one into child custody arrangements that ultimately led to the\r\nParkinson
  report. The voices of children and women are rarely heard.\r\nIndeed, even in the
  wake of her victory in the Victorian Supreme Court,\r\nMeredith Magill refused to
  grant interviews to any of the assembled\r\nreporters.\r\n\r\nThe work of Dr Lyn
  Turney, a researcher at Swinburne, suggests that this\r\nis not surprising. Turneyâ\x80\x99s
  groundbreaking research on women who keep\r\nâ\x80\x9Cpaternity secrets,â\x80\x9D
  which appeared in the most recent issue of the\r\nJournal of Family Studies, argues
  that the panic surrounding paternity\r\nfraud paints mothers as the central â\x80\x9Cmoral
  threatâ\x80\x9D to social stability.\r\nCharged as sexual deviants for the dual
  â\x80\x9Ccrimesâ\x80\x9D of infidelity and\r\nsluttishly having more than one partner
  - while posing in the community\r\nas â\x80\x9Cgoodâ\x80\x9D wives and mothers -
  the behaviour of such women is depicted as\r\nmorally indefensible. Says Turney:
  â\x80\x9CThey encapsulate not only female\r\nsexuality out of control but also a
  view of women as predatory,\r\ndeceptive, and instrumentalâ\x80\x9D. No wonder they
  donâ\x80\x99t want to stick their\r\nheads above the parapet.\r\n\r\nBut Turney
  wanted to know more. In particular, what led women to have\r\nand to keep â\x80\x9Cpaternity
  secretsâ\x80\x9D? Her results, the outcome of interviews\r\nwith 15 Australian women,
  are testament to the stubborn opacity of\r\nconception, the complexity of human
  relationships and the way in which\r\nboth shame and violence shape womenâ\x80\x99s
  sexual and reproductive lives.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, Kathleen Donnelly, the past
  girlfriend of Health\r\nMinister Tony Abbott who publicly - and mistakenly - declared
  him the\r\nfather of their long-ago adopted son, is not the only Australian woman\r\nto
  be confused about the genetic paternity of her offspring. In Turneyâ\x80\x99s\r\nsample,
  a number of women admitted to uncertainty about which man was\r\nthe genetic father
  of their child.\r\n\r\nBut few of these womenâ\x80\x99s stories conformed to the
  â\x80\x9Cpaternity fraudâ\x80\x9D\r\nstereotype of faithless wives with regular
  lovers. Instead, the women\r\nTurney interviewed told of sexual relationships that
  â\x80\x9Coverlappedâ\x80\x9D or\r\nhappened â\x80\x9Cin quick succession,â\x80\x9D
  as well as â\x80\x9Cone-offâ\x80\x9D encounters with\r\nfriends, acquaintance and
  old-flames that usually didnâ\x80\x99t involve either\r\ninfidelity or deception
  because the women were either unattached or only\r\nâ\x80\x9Cminimally attachedâ\x80\x9D
  to a dying, old or embryonic relationship at the\r\ntime. One woman, for example,
  had unplanned sex with a long-time friend:\r\nher first encounter after the death
  of her husband a year earlier.\r\nSeveral days later, she met a new man who became
  her regular partner.\r\nAnother woman told of a single sexual liaison with an old
  flame while\r\nsingle and trying to conceive a child with a known-donor. Both of
  these\r\nwomen, as well as others to whom Turney spoke, had dismissed the\r\nreproductive
  potential of these one-off encounters because they wanted\r\nto believe that their
  chosen or permanent partner - the one with whom\r\nthey were having regular unprotected
  sex - was the genetic father. It\r\nwas only when the baby bore a similarity to
  the biological father at\r\nbirth, or the woman later happened upon a childhood
  photograph of the\r\nbiological father, that the connection was made and the biological\r\nrealities
  of the situation accepted.\r\n\r\nThe threat of sexual violence or shaming also
  explains a number of cases\r\nof â\x80\x9Cpaternity fraudâ\x80\x9D. Several women,
  some of whom confessed\r\nstomach-turning tales of rape and abuse, withheld doubts
  about their\r\nchildâ\x80\x99s paternity for fear of their partnersâ\x80\x99 response.
  One woman told\r\nof being raped by a family friend and, believing herself to be
  at fault\r\nbecause she â\x80\x9Ctrusted himâ\x80\x9D, never told anyone of the
  assault or her\r\nsubsequent doubts about paternity.\r\n\r\nTurney also cites several
  instances where older domineering husbands\r\norganized sexual liaisons - in the
  context of an â\x80\x9Copen marriageâ\x80\x9D and\r\nplenty of drugs and alcohol
  - in which their wives participated. When\r\nthe women subsequently raised questions
  about the paternity of resulting\r\nchildren, the husbands â\x80\x9Cmutedâ\x80\x9D
  the discussion by â\x80\x9Chighlighting the\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99sâ\x80¦sexual transgressionsâ\x80\x9D
  and threatening them with public\r\ndisclosure. Such men â\x80\x9Cdrew upon the
  moral panic,â\x80\x9D in other words, to\r\nstop the woman revealing the secret
  about the childâ\x80\x99s paternity not to\r\nthe social father - who knew exactly
  what was going on - but to society\r\nat large. Only when the relationship broke
  down, and the question of\r\nsupport payments arose, did the men question the childâ\x80\x99s
  biological\r\npaternity.\r\n\r\nAbortion was considered by several women unsure
  about which man caused\r\ntheir pregnancy, but the men in their lives were not always
  supportive.\r\nThe Catholic step-father of a 16 year-old told her he would never
  speak\r\nto her again if she had an abortion, while a GP to whom another woman\r\nconfessed
  her lack of paternity certainty counselled her to â\x80\x9Cgo ahead\r\nwith the
  pregnancy and see what happensâ\x80\x9D. In one instance, the\r\nsuggestion of abortion
  triggered an angry response from the womanâ\x80\x99s\r\npartner because she was
  threatening to â\x80\x9Ckill [a] baby that was probably\r\nhisâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nThe
  knowledge that some â\x80\x9Cdefraudedâ\x80\x9D dads have about womenâ\x80\x99s
  paternity\r\nâ\x80\x9Csecretsâ\x80\x99 is perhaps the most important - and surprising
  - of Turneyâ\x80\x99s\r\nfindings. From the wife-swapping husband, to the abortion-opposing\r\npartner,
  to the spouse who knew his wife had conceived during a short\r\nbreak in their relationship
  yet nonetheless chose to sign the birth\r\nregistration papers and act in the role
  of the childâ\x80\x99s father, Turney\r\nexposes a range of scenarios where the
  wordâ\x80\x9Dfraud\" poorly describe what\r\nthe men involved describe as the problem
  they face, if indeed they\r\ndefine their situation as problematic at all. For one
  man, the issue was\r\nthat his partner was unfaithful, not that the resulting child
  wasnâ\x80\x99t\r\nbiologically â\x80\x9Chisâ\x80\x9D. However, in explaining his
  refusal to have a\r\npaternity test, the ex-partner of another woman said that while
  he was\r\nâ\x80\x9Cover the fact the [she had] slept with some else,â\x80\x9D he
  hadnâ\x80\x99t come to\r\nterms with the potential genetic consequences of her actions.\r\n\r\nIndeed,
  Turneyâ\x80\x99s revelation that some men know there are doubts about\r\ntheir childrenâ\x80\x99s
  genetic lineage or even that their children are\r\ndefinitely not biologically â\x80\x9Ctheirsâ\x80\x9D
  bolsters suggestions - rife in the\r\nacademic literature - that relationship breakdown
  is an important\r\ntrigger to menâ\x80\x99s (and consequently societyâ\x80\x99s)
  reworking of paternity\r\nâ\x80\x9Csecretsâ\x80\x9D into the moral crime of paternity
  â\x80\x9Cfraud.â\x80\x9D It also hints at\r\nthe unsavory possibility, vehemently
  rejected by Fatherâ\x80\x99s Rights groups,\r\nthat at least some men are motivated
  to test - in the wake of marital\r\nbreakdown - to escape child support liabilities.\r\n\r\nThe
  take home message of Turneyâ\x80\x99s research is simple, yet consistently\r\noverlooked
  in debates about paternity fraud. That human values, motives\r\nand relationships
  come in a myriad of complex - even convoluted - forms.\r\nâ\x80\x9COh, what a tangled
  web we weaveâ\x80\x9D, I wanted to sigh as each womanâ\x80\x99s tale\r\n- with its
  coercion and choice, misunderstanding and deception, care and\r\nindifference -
  unfolded. I also found Turneyâ\x80\x99s work suggestive of a\r\nnumber of ways the
  problem of paternity fraud could be understood, and\r\nfixed.\r\n\r\nWhat is clear
  is that it is a nonsense to brand all instances in which\r\nmen receive paternity
  test results showing they are not a childâ\x80\x99s\r\nbiological father as cases
  of â\x80\x9Cpaternity fraudâ\x80\x9D. As Turneyâ\x80\x99s research\r\nshows, such
  results may - or may not - be telling the man something he\r\ndidnâ\x80\x99t know
  already. Fraud implies deceit and if men know there is doubt\r\nabout a childâ\x80\x99s
  genetic paternity or are sure a child is not their\r\nbiological progeny - and have
  supported the pregnancy continuing (for\r\ninstance, by opposing an abortion) -
  then it is simply incorrect to\r\nclaim that they have duped either about their
  partnerâ\x80\x99s fidelity or into\r\naccepting legal responsibility for the child.\r\n\r\nBy
  definition, a victim of fraud is someone who has been injured, or at\r\nleast disadvantaged.
  To be defrauded is to be cheated of something that\r\nis rightfully yours. Indeed,
  the claim that â\x80\x9Crealâ\x80\x9D Dads are genetic\r\nones, and therefore that
  men who discover they are not the progenitor of\r\nthe child they are parenting
  have been cheated of fatherhood, is at the\r\nheart of Fatherâ\x80\x99s Rights Groups
  claims about the wrongs suffered by\r\nvictims of paternity fraud. Yet, research
  evidence, not to mention the\r\ndecisions of millions of men to adopt children or
  conceive them using\r\ndonor sperm, suggest that many men see the essence of fatherhood
  as\r\nparenting, not sperm-donation. For them, the â\x80\x9Crealâ\x80\x9D father
  is the one\r\nwho is â\x80\x9Cthereâ\x80\x9D not at the time of conception, but
  for the joys and hard\r\nwork of parenting.\r\n\r\nOf course, many - if not most
  - men want to be both the genetic and the\r\nsocial father of their child. Were
  this not the case, chastity belts\r\nwould never have been invented, nor the debilitating
  laws and attitudes\r\nthat until recently condemned â\x80\x9Cunwed mothersâ\x80\x9D
  and their â\x80\x9Cbastardâ\x80\x9D\r\nchildren to legal and social non-personhood.
  When women keep paternity\r\nsecrets, they deprive men of the knowledge that would
  instigate an\r\nexploration of their values regarding social and genetic fatherhood,
  and\r\nthe chance to make partnering and parenting choices based on those\r\nvalues.
  Paternity secrets deprive men of the chance to say â\x80\x9Cthanks but\r\nno thanksâ\x80\x9D
  to an offer of social, but not biological, fatherhood.\r\n\r\nAll this cashes out
  to a definition of the problem that focuses on the\r\nabuse of trust caused by infidelity
  and subsequent deception about the\r\ninfidelity, and the consequent denial to men
  of the chance to make\r\ninformed decisions about partnering and parenting. Such
  a definition\r\ndoes not make the parenting of an unrelated child a quandary in
  and of\r\nitself, but only one in the context of a lack of female honesty and\r\ninformed
  decision-making by the man. The difficulty is not the return of\r\nDNA results that
  show a social father is not a biological one, but the\r\nreturn of such results
  to a man who did not know there was any doubt\r\nabout his partnerâ\x80\x99s sexual
  fidelity and his genetic paternity. The\r\ntrouble is the discrepancy between what
  men believe is the case about\r\ntheir partnerâ\x80\x99s fidelity and genetic paternity,
  and the reality. The\r\nproblem isnâ\x80\x99t paternity fraud. The problem is paternal
  discrepancy.\r\n\r\nWhat all this should make clear is that the current child support\r\npayment
  system, which assigns payment obligations on the basis of\r\nbiological paternity,
  not parenting commitment, is tragically flawed.\r\nRegardless of whether or not
  he suspected, knew or had no idea that the\r\nchild he was parenting was genetically
  unrelated, and notwithstanding\r\nhowever culpable his female partnerâ\x80\x99s
  behavior was in creating that\r\nsituation, the law needs to recognize and affirm
  menâ\x80\x99s value to children\r\nas parents - and people - not sperm donors. Playing
  the biological card\r\nnot only undercuts research findings that affirm the importance
  to\r\nchildren of having an active male parent in their lives, but lends\r\nsupport
  to the insulting claim made by a sperm donor interviewed on Four\r\nCorners last
  month that he, not the man who invested 20 years of time\r\nand love, was his daughterâ\x80\x99s
  â\x80\x9Crealâ\x80\x9D father.\r\n\r\nDitto for recent suggestions that DNA paternity
  testing ought to be made\r\ncompulsory at birth. Turneyâ\x80\x99s research makes
  it easy to imagine the man\r\nwho suspects or even knows that his new bundle of
  joy is not a\r\nbiological relation compelled to face a doctor or nurse delivering
  the\r\nâ\x80\x9Cnegativeâ\x80\x9D results of a mandatory paternity test. How likely
  is such a\r\nman to admit to knowing and not caring about the sexual and biological\r\nrealities
  surrounding his childâ\x80\x99s conception if he feels this will brand\r\nhim as
  cuckold and a mug? Better, he may feel, to beat his chest, cry\r\nfoul and walk
  out on his wife and new baby.\r\n\r\nOf course, rejecting mandatory paternity testing
  at birth does not mean\r\nthat men should not be assisted to accept the obligations
  of fatherhood\r\nin a more informed way. Upon the birth of a child, men ought to
  be given\r\nthe opportunity to give one-time-only non-rescindable consent to their\r\nacceptance
  of the rights and responsibilities of fatherhood. If they\r\nfeel unable to sign
  on the dotted line without conclusive proof that\r\nthey are the biological progenitor,
  they should be offered a DNA test\r\nfree of charge.\r\n\r\nHowever, once a man
  does formally accept social and legal responsibility\r\nfor a child - either with
  knowledge of their genetic paternity or in the\r\nface of a fully informed waiver
  of that knowledge - their status as the\r\nchildâ\x80\x99s legal father should rightly
  be set in stone. No DNA skeletons\r\nrattling out of the cupboards at a later date
  should impact on what they\r\nlegally owe their child, or hopefully, how they feel
  about the kid who\r\ncalls him Dad.\r\n\r\nDr Leslie Cannold is a bioethicist at
