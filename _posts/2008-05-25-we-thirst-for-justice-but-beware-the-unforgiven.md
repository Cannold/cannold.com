    sand dividing the venal from the inescapably evil? Are there some\r\nthings, and
    some people, we cannot forgive?\r\n\r\nAs an ethicist, I am asked this question
    more than any other. Perhaps\r\nbecause the thirst for justice-and vengeance-comes
    easily to human\r\nbeings, but can be seen to conflict with the Christian imperative
    to\r\nforgive.\r\n\r\nI have sympathy for those who claim some actions, and the
    people who\r\nperpetrate them, are beyond the pale. My personal candidate for
    Ms\r\nUnforgiveability is American woman Debra Milke, who conspired with two\r\npsychopathic
    drug-addled â\x80\x9Cfriendsâ\x80\x9D to lure her four year old son into\r\nthe
    desert on the pretence of meeting Santa Claus and catching snakes so\r\nthey colud
    t execute him, and collect the insurance money. Tussling for\r\nthe crown, of
    course, are Australians John Bunting and Robert Wagner\r\nwhose hatred of paedophiles
    and homosexuals saw them torture and\r\ndismember their innocent victims by crushing
    toes with pliers and\r\napplying electric shocks.\r\n\r\nAs it happens, the creatures
    involved in these crimes were either\r\nsentenced to die, or to spend the rest
    of their lives in jail. A good\r\nthing in my view, because while unforgiveability
    may be a helpful moral\r\nconcept, its practical use may be seriously questioned.\r\n\r\nThe
    process of setting moral standards is a collective one. When a\r\nmember of our
    community becomes a victim of a moral crime, it is our\r\nreaction to the event-the
    words of our leaders, talk-back radio calls,\r\nchat around the water-cooler-that
    either affirms or modifies the\r\nexisting consensus on what Is acceptable behaviour.
    Whether itâ\x80\x99s a child\r\nraped by the trusted parish Priest, a wife betrayed
    by a sexual liaison\r\nbetween her husband and best friend, or the frail old codger
    defrauded\r\nby the down-and-out youth he sought to assist, condemning such acts
    as\r\nunforgivable contributes to the collective process of defining who we\r\nare
    by what we believe is right and wrong. It is from such definitions,\r\nand the
    process we undertake to arrive at them, that our children learn\r\nour moral code.\r\n\r\nBut
    while unforgiveability may be a useful tool for preventing heinous\r\nmoral transgressions
    in the first place, once citizens have done the\r\nunspeakable, its practical
    use-if the unforgiven are destined to one day\r\nreturn to society-can be questioned.\r\n\r\nHuman
    beings live up, or down, to the expectations others have of them.\r\nTreat Eliza
    Doolittle like a crass bit of street scum, and thatâ\x80\x99s how\r\nsheâ\x80\x99ll
    behave. But my dear Henry Higgins, behold the transformation when\r\nyou treat
    her like a lady! Our sense of self is formed, and to a large\r\ndegree maintained,
    through our interactions with others. If our friends\r\nand neighbours dismiss
    us as beyond redemption, then we are likely we\r\nwill see ourselves this way,
    and to behave accordingly. Why try to\r\nchange, to put in the hard yards to unpick
    patterns of thought and\r\nbehaviour that led one to sin so grievously in the
    past, when everyone\r\nyou know and live among has written you off? When no matter
    what you do,\r\nthere is no chance of being forgiven?\r\n\r\nSo are some acts,
    and some folk, unforgivable? The answer has to be\r\nâ\x80\x9Cyes,â\x80\x9D though
    it comes with a warning: the unforgiven are dangerous\r\ncharacters to have roaming
    the streets. So if we canâ\x80\x99t find it in our\r\nhearts to forgive, we would
    be wise to throw away the key."
