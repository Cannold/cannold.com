  content: "Back in 1900, a group of politicians sat down and drafted up a set of
    laws to govern the Australian state of New South Wales. One can only assume they
    were wearing wigs. And there were, of course, things they decided weren't acceptable
    in polite, turn-of-the-century society. Probably a lot of stuff about stealing
    another man's horse.\r\n\r\nBut as time passed things shifted and many of those
    lawsâ\x80\x94now more than 100 years oldâ\x80\x94were amended or repealed entirely.
    That is except for Section 82-84 of the Crimes Act 1900, which makes it illegal
    for a woman to get an abortion in Australia's most populous state.\r\n\r\nReading
    like a Shakespearean sonnet, the law specifically instructs that:\r\n\r\nWhosoever,
    being a woman with child, \r\nunlawfully administers to herself any drug or noxious
    thing, or\r\nunlawfully uses any instrument or other means,\r\nwith intent in
    any such case to procure her miscarriage,\r\nshall be liable to imprisonment for
    ten years.\r\n\r\nIf you didn't catch that: A woman who tries to terminate her
    pregnancy is up for 10 years in jail. And that's not all. She doesn't even have
    to go through with the abortion, she just needs some intention of doing so. And
    any doctor who procures abortion drugs is also breaking the law, and faces five
    year behind bars.\r\n\r\nIt's insane that this incredibly outdated law is still
    on the books. But to be fair, it's not as though women are being arrested over
    it on a daily basis. This isn't a law police really enforce, and those who oppose
    changing it will often say that abortion is only \"technically illegal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I
    don't know what 'technically illegal' means,\" says Associate Professor Leslie
    Cannold, an abortion reform activist who played a central role in repealing Australia's
    national ban on abortion drug RU486 (a \"noxious thing\" under the law). But although
    Leslie says people who seek abortions usually aren't prosecuted, she concedes
    \"if it's in the criminal code, it's in the criminal code.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every now
    and then you'll get a police officer who didn't get the memo that this is a law
    we don't enforce,\" Cannold says, pointing to the case of Tegan Leach who was
    just 19 years old when she was prosecuted for getting an abortion.\r\n\r\nLeach
    was charged in Queensland, rather than NSW, but both states maintain these century-old
    laws. Eventually, Leach and her partner were found not guilty, but only after
    a lengthy 18-month court battle, where she faced seven years in jail if she lost.\r\n\r\nQueensland's
    abortion laws haven't changed in the years since. Just last week it emerged that
    a 12-year-old girl had to wait weeks to access an abortion in the state. In the
    Northern Territory, politicians are fighting against the introducing of RU486,
    dismissing abortion as a \"fashion trend.\"\r\n\r\nBack in NSW, Cannold says it
    doesn't matter whether the law is enforced or notâ\x80\x94abortion remaining a
    criminal offence stigmatises women, and reinforces the idea that abortion is wrong
    or shameful. The state's workaround is for a doctor to say the woman's health
    is in danger if the pregnancy isn't terminated.\r\n\r\nBut that isn't always the
    case: sometimes a woman just doesn't want have a baby. In 2016, a woman shouldn't
    have to lie to access an abortion. \"One in three women will have an abortion
    in their lifetime,\" Cannold says. \"This isn't a minority issue.\"\r\n\r\nGreens
    MP Mehreen Faruqi is petitioning the NSW government is change these laws. She's
    also pushing the state to bring in \"safe zones\" around abortion facilitiesâ\x80\x94like
    Victoria hasâ\x80\x94that would essentially mean protestors have to stay at least
    150 metres from the entrance. The Abortion Law Reform Bill also addresses the
    issue of doctors who are against abortion, requiring them \"to disclose conscientious
    objection at the start of the consultation and refer patients to another doctor
    who does not have such an objection.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a conversation NSW Parliament
    has been avoiding for more than one hundred years,\" Dr Faruqi said Thursday.
