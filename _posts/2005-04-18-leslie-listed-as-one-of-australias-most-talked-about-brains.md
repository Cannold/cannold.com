Alongside notables such as Professor Peter Singer, playwrite David Williamson, Nobel Prize Winner Peter Doherty, Professor Gustav Nossal, Professor Stuart MacIntyre, writer Helen Garner, Historian Inga Clendinnen and Dr Tim Flannery, Cannold has been selected as one who works with ideas or whose contribution to issues affects how Australian society sees and understands itself.
