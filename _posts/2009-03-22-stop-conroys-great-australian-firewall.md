    oppose the filter because it will do nothing to stop\r\nchild abuse, will both
    slow down and cock up the net, and because\r\ncensorship in a liberal democratic

    and more costly for the rest of us.\r\n\r\nThis is old news. In 2004 the Howard
    government, initially enthusiastic\r\nabout a filter, rejected it for this reason,
    in favour of a website\r\noffering advice and voluntary filters that parents could
    voluntarily\r\ndownload. It is also why some Coalition senators-even conservative\r\nChristians
    like Nick Minchin and Cory Bernardi-are now wary of it. That,\r\nand the fact
    that the government agency compiling the list for voluntary\r\nfilters recently
    added a pro-life website with graphic images of fetuses\r\nto the 1300 urls or
    web pages currently banned. This could go to 10,000\r\nsites if the Government
    has its way. The banned list is not reviewable,\r\nand its contents secret, and
    not subject to FOI requests.\r\n\r\nIf mandatory filtering is not about stopping
    child abuse, what is the\r\naim of those spruiking the Great Australian firewall?\r\n\r\nThe
