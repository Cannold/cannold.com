    you, my readers, know, Iâ\x80\x99ve read a lot of terrific books lately, but The
    Book of Rachael  is splendid.\r\n\r\nSplendid in its conception, and splendid
    in its execution, Leslie Cannoldâ\x80\x99s first novel is an imagined life of
    the sister of Jesus.  Nothing is known of her, not even her name, and to right
    this wrong that insults all women, Cannold has created a rich and turbulent life,
    almost as messianic as Jesusâ\x80\x99 own.\r\n\r\nRachael is a passionate, intelligent
    girl, quick to learn and easily frustrated by the claustrophobic religious and
    cultural restrictions that bind her.   Because she is female, she is doomed to
    spend her life walking three steps behind a man, cooking, cleaning and serving
    him.  She may not learn to read, or question or join in menâ\x80\x99s conversations.
    \ She needs a manâ\x80\x99s permission and an escort in order to travel.  She
    has no place before the law where any testimony she might offer counts for nothing.
    \ She must cover her body and keep out of sacred places when â\x80\x98uncleanâ\x80\x99.
    \  If raped or otherwise â\x80\x98sulliedâ\x80\x99 by sex outside marriage, she,
    not he, will be punished, by death or by being cast out penniless from her community.
    \ Should she not marry, she will be ostracised as a harlot, even if she joins
    the community of healing women from whom the community seeks help whenever they
    are ill.\r\n\r\nLife for a female in 30 AD sounds familiar, although this is the
    21st century, eh?  I wonder if men reading this novel will feel the same sense
    of outrage when this cumulative catalogue of discrimination is revealed, and they
    recognise it as the persisting inequity that cramps the lives of women in the
    Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan.  I hope so.    \r\nBindy, the ancient healer,
    encapsulates the dilemma for oppressed women everywhere: busy with an epidemic
    she tells Rachael not to indulge her rage though she feels it herself.  There
    is no point, she says,\r\n\r\n â\x80¦because it will not be changed.  Not by one
    woman alone.  Not in my lifetime, and not in yoursâ\x80¦.Do not swim with rocks
    in your pocket, Rachael.  Smother your rage.  Dedicate your wit and passion where
    there is hope.â\x80\x99 (p177)\r\n\r\nYet The Book of Rachael is no feminist polemic.
    \ It is a wonderful love story, a story of two passionate natures, and of betrayal.
    \ For Rachael falls in love with Judah, her brotherâ\x80\x99s dearest friend and
    the one known to us as he who betrayed Jesus to the chief priests.\r\n\r\nBecause
    nothing is known of any sisters that Jesus almost certainly had, Cannold has given
    full rein to an imagined life, which makes the book â\x80\x98unputdownableâ\x80\x99.
    \ Events conspire to make Bindy re-evaluate her advice to Rachael; â\x80\x98miraclesâ\x80\x99
    of a less spiritual kind happen when persons lost are found again.  Even the conclusion
    is not as might be expected. "
