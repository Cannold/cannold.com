    powerful men in the west, spread across a range of denominations,\r\nspewing raw
    hate and naked prejudice at gay people. All in the name of\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nWe
    are talking about the sort of hate that gives rise to claim that\r\nhomosexual
    â\x80\x9Cinclinationsâ\x80\x9D are an â\x80\x9Cintrinsic moral evilâ\x80\x9D that,
    if acted\r\nupon, preclude gays from taking communion, occupying any official
    role\r\nin the church and, ultimately, entering the Kingdom of God. The sort of\r\nprejudice
    that led the Australian Anglican Archbishop to forbid any\r\nparish in his archdiocese
    to welcome the openly gay American Bishop Gene\r\nRobinson, and to declare that
    if Robinson was invited to a crucial\r\nmeeting of the worldâ\x80\x99s Anglican
    bishops in Lambeth, then the Australian\r\nArchbishop would not be attending.\r\n\r\nI
    am sorry, but someone seems to have had a fundamental misunderstanding\r\nof the
    core insights of the Gospels, and it isnâ\x80\x99t me. It was precisely\r\nthis
    sort of attack on social outcasts of Jesusâ\x80\x99s time by the powerful\r\nmen
    of the day-the Temple Priests-that inspired Jesusâ\x80\x99s mission and the\r\nbirth
    of Christianity. Precisely this sort of exclusion of vulnerable\r\nand minority
    groups from society that saw Jesus enter the Temple to\r\nchallenge the Priestsâ\x80\x99
    authority to decide who was cast out, and who\r\nincluded in the circle of Godâ\x80\x99s
    concern.\r\n\r\nThereâ\x80\x99s a joke about a pamphlet entitled, â\x80\x9CWhat
    Jesus said about\r\nHomosexuality.â\x80\x9D When you open it, the pages are blank.
    As far as I can\r\ntell, even the lunar religious right in America admits that
    Jesus never\r\nsaid anything about homosexuality.\r\n\r\nBut even if the Bible
    did advise us to shun homosexuals or stone them\r\n(as it suggests for adulterers),
    we donâ\x80\x99t have to listen. After all, we\r\nignore its command to wed our
    virginal daughters to their rapists, and\r\nrefuse its permission to purchases
    the children of foreigners to serve\r\nus as slaves.\r\n\r\nThe point is that
    even those who claim absolute obedience to scripture\r\nare selective in the scripture
    they obey. They know as well as anyone\r\nthat there is much in the Bible that
    is irrelevant, outdated or just\r\nplain barbaric.\r\n\r\nAnd spare me the Bible-made-me-do-it
    crap. It didnâ\x80\x99t work for the Nazis\r\nat Nuremberg and it wonâ\x80\x99t
    work here. Acting pursuant to orders by\r\nsuperiors of any sort doesnâ\x80\x99t
    relieve an individual of responsibility if\r\na moral choice is possible.\r\n\r\nPowerful
    Christian leaders have a choice. They donâ\x80\x99t have to vilify and\r\ndiscriminate
    against gay people, they choose to, and for this they can -\r\nand should - be
    condemned.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of leader makes this sort of choice? Neither the word\r\nâ\x80\x9CChristianâ\x80\x9D
    or â\x80\x9Cethicalâ\x80\x9D spring to mind.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one day both our spiritual
    and political leaders will get it\r\nthrough their heads that taking potshots
    at people because of who they\r\nare, not what they do, is stupid, wrong and not
    very nice. That everyone\r\ndeserves respect and a fair go no matter the colour
    of their skin, their\r\nmarital status, if and how they worship or who they love.
    That\r\nindividuals have a moral right to be judged on nothing more nor less\r\nthan
    what Martin Luther King Jr. called, â\x80\x9Cthe content of their\r\ncharacter.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nAnd
    if the powerful men who yearn for the good old days when they could\r\nstimatise
    and exclude whoever they liked while calling themselves holy\r\nrefuse to change
    their prejudicial ways, they should have the courage to\r\nsource this decision
    in their own dark heart, not an ancient book."
