    an Abbott prime ministership, has resurrected fears about young\r\npeopleâ\x80\x99s
    medical privacy.\r\n\r\nSeventeen-year-old â\x80\x9CShannonâ\x80\x9D sought support
    from a counsellor for issues\r\narising from domestic violence and her mother
    and stepfatherâ\x80\x99s mental\r\nillness. Without Shannonâ\x80\x99s consent
    or knowledge, the counsellor\r\ndisclosed her confidences to family members and
    those living with her in\r\nsupported accommodation.\r\n\r\nThe privacy breach,
    discussed at length in a recent episode of ABC\r\nRadioâ\x80\x99s The Law Report,
    brought Shannonâ\x80\x99s already fragile life undone.\r\nShe is no longer on
    speaking terms with any family members, and is\r\nterrified of confiding in any
    members of the helping professions whose\r\nsupport and comfort she arguably needs.\r\n\r\nIn
    the words of the solicitor from the Youth Law Legal Service in\r\nMelbourne who
    obtained both an apology and compensation for the young\r\ngirl, the professionalâ\x80\x99s
    breach of her privacy caused her\r\nâ\x80\x9Csevereâ\x80¦traumaâ\x80¦and upset.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nHealth
    professionals and their professional bodies agree that privacy is\r\na critical
    component of effective healthcare for adolescents. Even\r\nFrancis Sullivan, the
    former CEO of Catholic Health Australia, an\r\nindustry body not known for its
    emphasis on patient rights where these\r\nconflict with Catholic teachings, has
    noted that non-consensual\r\ndisclosure of young peopleâ\x80\x99s healthcare information
    risks exacerbating\r\nâ\x80\x9Câ\x80¦the very causes that led some teenagers to
    seek help outside the\r\nfamily.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nAt the heart of the near-universal
    support for adolescent health privacy\r\nis an extensive body of data. The research
    shows that the greatest\r\nbarrier to young people seeking medical help is the
    fear their parents\r\nmay find out.\r\n\r\nThe converse is also true. â\x80\x9CYoung
    people are more willing to disclose\r\nsensitive personal information and return
    for follow-up care,â\x80\x9D says\r\nProfessor Susan Sawyer, director of the Centre
    for Adolescent Health at\r\nthe Royal Childrenâ\x80\x99s Hospital, â\x80\x9Cwhen
    services are known to be\r\nconfidential.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIn Australia, â\x80\x9Cmature
    minorsâ\x80\x9D are authorised to make decisions about\r\ntheir medical treatment.
    A mature minor is a tween or teen with\r\nsufficient understanding and intelligence
    to understand the nature and\r\nconsequences of the medical intervention proposed,
    and to give informed\r\nconsent to it.\r\n\r\nWhile all those under 18 must be
    accessed on such criteria, it is\r\ngenerally assumed that those over 17 are mature
    minors, that those 14 to\r\n16 are reasonably likely to be, and that those under
    14 may not have\r\ncapacity to consent, particularly in relation to more serious\r\ntreatments.
    The requirement for confidentiality is a corollary of the\r\nmature minor framework.\r\n\r\nNever
    one to let evidence muddy the waters of ideology, the now\r\nOpposition leader
    Tony Abbott was part of a government that in 2003\r\nlifted the age at which information
    about a childâ\x80\x99s healthcare visits\r\ncould be accessed by their parents
    from 12 to 14. As Health Minister he\r\nvigorously argued for this threshold to
    be lifted again, from 14 to 16.\r\nHad he succeeded, an entire group of Australians
    would have been denied\r\nindependent and confidential medical care, despite most
    qualifying for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nLuckily, Abbott failed. But his vigorous pursuit
    of the change reveal\r\nmuch about the values and priorities of the man polls
    tell us is most\r\nlikely to be Australiaâ\x80\x99s next Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nFor
    Abbott, the right of parents to know what doctors their kids are\r\nvisiting and
    when takes priority over the right of that â\x80\x9Cchildâ\x80\x9D - the\r\nterm
    he diligently applies to 14 and 15 year olds - to privacy.\r\n\r\nWhile conceding
    that some 14 and 15-year-olds might â\x80\x9Cwish to conceal\r\nfrom their parentsâ\x80\x9D
    the medical procedures they have had or the\r\nprescription drugs they are on,
    he contends that â\x80\x9Cchildren should not be\r\npresumed to be the best judges
    of their own long-term interests and\r\nshould not have the right to go behind
    their parentsâ\x80\x99 backs.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nWhen parents and children are at
    odds, says Abbott, â\x80\x9Cthe responsibility\r\nof government - and doctors
    - is to support parental authority.â\x80\x9D This is\r\nbecause adolescents canâ\x80\x99t
    act in their own best interests and so require\r\nadults to make their decisions,
    and â\x80\x9Cjudgmental parentsâ\x80\x9D should not be\r\nassumed to be capable
    of inflicting more harm on their children than\r\nâ\x80\x9Cpermissive doctors.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIt
    is noteworthy that the â\x80\x9Cchildrenâ\x80\x9D to whom Abbott refers are largely\r\nyoung
    women. Both logic and anecdotal evidence suggest that young men\r\nhave less need
    of medical advice, and fewer privacy concerns. â\x80\x9CGuys\r\ndonâ\x80\x99t
    have as much to worry about,â\x80\x9D one 16 year old girl told *The\r\nCanberra
    Times*. â\x80\x9Câ\x80¦ they canâ\x80\x99t get pregnant.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIn a
    final and characteristically clueless fiscal flourish, Abbott notes\r\nthat giving
    parents the power to purvey their (mostly daughtersâ\x80\x99)\r\nmedical records
    was really not that much power at all. He scoffs at the\r\nclaim that such privacy
    invasions might cash out in suicide or backyard\r\nabortion because â\x80\x9CThe
    worst that might happen is a teenager accessing a\r\nservice but not claiming
    a rebate.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nWhat is she going to pay medical bills or script costs
    worth hundreds of\r\ndollars with, Tony? Her parentally-controlled trust fund?
    Grandmaâ\x80\x99s\r\nbackyard stash?\r\n\r\nThe Liberals are doing their best
    to keep Autocratic Abbott under wraps,\r\nand to repair Abbottâ\x80\x99s relations
    with women (he breakfasted not long ago\r\nwith feminist blogger Mia Freedman).
    I suspect heâ\x80\x99s also been out\r\nmending fences with others in the community
    who have memories better\r\nthan goldfish about life under Abbott and Howard.\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99m
    having none of it. Leopards donâ\x80\x99t change their spots. Tony Abbott is\r\nstill
    the Mad Monk or, as his daughter put it, â\x80\x9Ca lameâ\x80¦ churchy loser.â\x80\x9D\r\nIf
    he comes to power, the Christian right will still have his ear and\r\njust as
    it was in the past, women, gays, single mothers, young people,\r\nAborigines,
    religious minorities, migrants and those with the audacity\r\nto be disabled or
    unemployed will need to watch out.\r\n\r\nLabor needs to stop making elliptical
    references to the nightmare of an\r\nAbbott-led government and start spelling
    out exactly whose rights are\r\nlikely to cancelled, and whose best interests
    will be decided by others.\r\n\r\nThey need to explain not just what an Abbott-led
    Liberal government is\r\nlikely to mean for â\x80\x9Cworking familiesâ\x80\x9D
    and unionists, but the impact it\r\nwould have on the rights, privacy and freedoms
