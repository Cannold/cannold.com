    in Australia, and are\r\nnow refusing to leave their boat after being intercepted

    to develop a national\r\npopulation policy.\r\n\r\nBut knowing why hysteria ensues
    each time a leaky vessel enters\r\nAustralian territorial waters doesnâ\x80\x99t
    tell us how we should respond to\r\nthe men, women and children on board seeking
    our protection and whom\r\nhistory suggests will overwhelmingly be found to be
    genuine refugees.\r\n\r\nWe all know whatâ\x80\x99s right. We know in the same
    way we know that if a\r\nyoung, scared-looking woman pounded on our door in the
    middle of the\r\nnight seeking refuge from some unseen persecutor, that we must
    let her\r\nin. Refusing to open the door - or, having seen her approach through
    the\r\nblinds, unleashing the dog to drive her from the gate and into the arms\r\nof
    our none-too-savoury neighbour - doesnâ\x80\x99t absolve us of a duty to\r\nhelp.
    It simply adds â\x80\x9Cweaselâ\x80\x9D to the charge sheet.\r\n\r\nYet, in policy
    terms, this is what federal Labor is doing. This year,\r\nthe Government has allocated
    $654 million to what it loftily describes\r\nas a â\x80\x9Ccomprehensive, whole-of-governmentâ\x80\x9D
    approach to â\x80\x9Ccombat[ing]\r\npeople smugglersâ\x80\x9D. We need to stop
    kidding ourselves. Even if we\r\neliminate people smugglers, the people needing
    smuggling wonâ\x80\x99t\r\ndisappear. Just because people donâ\x80\x99t suffer
    on our patch doesnâ\x80\x99t mean\r\nthey arenâ\x80\x99t suffering.\r\n\r\nAnd
    anyone who thinks our Indonesian â\x80\x9Cfriendsâ\x80\x9D are not exploiting
    this\r\nGovernmentâ\x80\x99s determination to do whatever it takes to deny less
    than 300\r\npeople on-shore processing of their asylum claims needs to consult
    the\r\ndictionary definition of realpolitik.\r\n\r\nThe international convention
    on refugees was developed in response to\r\nthe outflow of Jews from Europe after
    World War II and in light of the\r\ndeaths of a third of the 937 men, women and
    children who embarked on\r\nwhat a later Hollywood movie would call the Voyage
    of the Damned. Having\r\nfled Nazi persecution in 1939, the SS St Louis was forced
    back to Europe\r\nafter being denied entry to Canada, the US and Cuba.\r\n\r\nAustralia
    signed the refugee convention in the 1950s but if we canâ\x80\x99t\r\nhonour our
    obligations, we should have the decency to formally withdraw.\r\nBetter still,
    we could elect federal politicians with the will and\r\ncapacity to lead, rather
    than grovel to the lowest common denominator.\r\nThe Prime Minister still has
    the moral authority - not to mention the\r\nelectoral margin - to open a new policy
    and rhetorical chapter on asylum\r\nseekers and population issues more generally.\r\n\r\nShould
    he fail to do so, Australiaâ\x80\x99s policies on refugees will remain\r\njust
