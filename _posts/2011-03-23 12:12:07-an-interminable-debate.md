  content: "Giving Sorrow Words, By Melinda Tankard-Reist, Duffy & Snellgrove,\r\n$17.95\r\n\r\nAre
    women who have abortions free moral agents or coerced victims?\r\n\r\nTHE bulk
    of Giving Sorrow Words consists of 19 edited stories of womenâ\x80\x99s\r\ngrief
    after abortion. The stories, and the introduction and afterword\r\nthat sandwich
    them, emphasise female victimhood. In Melinda\r\nTankard-Reistâ\x80\x99s world,
    women are coerced into having sex and abortions\r\nthey donâ\x80\x99t want by
    their husbands, their parents, their doctors and, of\r\ncourse, feminists and
    abortionists.\r\n\r\nQuoting American anti-pornography campaigner Catharine MacKinnon\r\napprovingly,
    Tankard-Reist asserts that women have been tricked into\r\nbelieving they want
    and benefit from the contraceptives and abortion\r\nthat underpin their sexual
    freedom. Instead, abortion was legalised to\r\nserve a manâ\x80\x99s requirements
    for sexual access to women and free him of\r\nthe inconvenient results of that
    access, children.\r\n\r\nIndeed, reading Giving Sorrow Words is like time-warping
    back to the\r\nvictim feminist hey-day of the late 1970s and \"80s. Thereâ\x80\x99s
    Adrienne\r\nRich asserting that abortion is violence against women, Catharine\r\nMacKinnon
    insisting that most women only have sex because they are\r\nregularly forced or
    pressured, and Germaine Greer claiming that womenâ\x80\x99s\r\nreal vulnerability
    in the matter of reproduction makes their claims to\r\nany choice in the matter
    a fiction.\r\n\r\nSuch victim rhetoric - now largely discredited - reflected the
    struggle\r\nof radical feminists to explain why women continued to mother - some\r\neven
    pursuing painful infertility treatments to do so - despite their\r\nassertions
    that motherhood was the locus of female oppression.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Tankard-Reist
    struggles to depict women as helpless,\r\nindoctrinated, coerced victims who lack
    any trace of moral agency in\r\norder to explain why they have sex when they donâ\x80\x99t
    want to become\r\nmothers, and abort unwanted pregnancies. It is only once she
    has\r\ndemonstrated that all women have sex, use contraception and have\r\nabortions
    against their will, that she can claim that the prohibitionist\r\npolicies on
    abortion supported by her long-time employer Senator Brian\r\nHarradine actually
    liberate women.\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s a big agenda, and one at which she fails miserably.
    Because what\r\nbecomes clear as one turns page after page of what even Tankard-Reist\r\nadmits
    makes bleak reading is that what women find so painful are\r\nproblematic pregnancies,
    not problematic abortions.\r\n\r\nAs the stories, and the recent NHMRC Information
    Paper on Termination of\r\nPregnancy in Australia makes clear, one of the biggest
    predictors of\r\nongoing ambivalence after abortion (a phenomenon experienced
    by only 2\r\nper cent of aborting women) is coercion. This coercion can come in
    the\r\nform of social circumstances - such as unemployment - that women feel\r\npreclude
    them from being a good mother, and abusive or threatening\r\nhusbands/boyfriends
    or parents.\r\n\r\nAside from the ongoing pursuit by feminists of social equity
    and justice\r\nfor women, feminist abortion service providers operating in public\r\nfree-standing
    clinics seek to enhance female autonomy by adhering to\r\nbest-practice information
    and counselling guidelines. Such an approach\r\nacknowledges the womanâ\x80\x99s
    values and competence as a moral\r\ndecision-maker.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that
    proper counselling is an expense some private\r\noperators seek to avoid. Perhaps
    if Tankard-Reist changed tacks and\r\nencouraged Harradine to stop trying - in
    line with his religious\r\ncommitments - to derail, defund and legally harass
    such clinics, there\r\nwould be fewer sorrowful women needing their stories told
    in the first\r\nplace."
