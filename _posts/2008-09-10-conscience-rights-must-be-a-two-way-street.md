    hypocritical\r\n\r\nIs it ever right to use oneâ\x80\x99s freedom to deny the
    exact same freedom to\r\nothers? What if those others are people you are sworn
    to serve and\r\nprotect?\r\n\r\nSuch questions may not be front of mind for our
    State MPs, but they\r\nshould be. Before the year is out, Victorian Parliamentarians
    will cast\r\na conscience vote on bills about physician-assisted suicide, abortion\r\nand
    Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs). Conscience clauses will\r\nbe contained
    in each of these bills.\r\n\r\nOur understanding of the proper role of conscience
    in politics and\r\nhealth remains remain murky. What is conscience, why are we
    pledged to\r\nhonour it, and what responsibilities do those who claim the right
    to\r\nfollow theirs have to others?\r\n\r\nThe right to act according to the dictates
    of our conscience is founded\r\nin the value of autonomy. Autonomy means self-rule.
    An autonomous person\r\nis one who is free to direct her life according to her
    own values.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to overestimate the role autonomy-and so\r\nconscience-plays
    in the value systems of contemporary Australian\r\nsociety. Our political and
    legal structures are grounded in the belief,\r\nto paraphrase High Court Justice
    McHugh, that autonomous individuals are\r\nentitled to make, and are consequently
    responsible for their own\r\nchoices. Our health system, in line with that of
    others in the western\r\nworld, has shifted in the last few decades from the paternalistic
    idea\r\nthat doctors know best, to the view that patients have a right to make\r\ntheir
    own informed choices about their care.\r\n\r\nAll this suggests what is true:
    that most learned discussions of\r\nconscience focus on the duties lawmakers and
    medicos have to protect the\r\nautonomy of citizens and patients. This is for
    good reason. Both our\r\nelected representatives and health care staff are professionals:
    trusted\r\nand respected members of society with a duty of care to those they
    are\r\nsworn to serve and heal.\r\n\r\nDespite this, some professionals in Victoria
    seem primarily concerned\r\nwith their rights when it comes to conscience, not
    their obligations.\r\nSome MPs, understandably pleased at the rare opportunity
    to shrug off\r\nparty discipline, see a conscience vote as a chance for them to
    register\r\ntheir own value positions on the issues at hand. In the same way,\r\nconscience
    clauses in bills on euthanasia, abortion and ARTs tend to\r\nspell out the entitlements
    of medical professionals to refuse treatment\r\nthey deem morally objectionable,
    but are silent on their obligations to\r\nensure patients get timely, appropriate
    care.\r\n\r\nWe need to get the balance right. Yes, the entitlements of MPs and\r\nmedical
    professionals to follow the dictates of their consciences are\r\npart of the autonomy
    story. But if mutual obligation means anything,\r\nthen political and medical
    professionals who assert their right to vote\r\nor to refuse care on grounds of
    conscience must take their\r\nresponsibilities to foster the autonomy of those
    they are bound to\r\nserve-we citizens and patients-just as seriously.\r\n\r\nThey
    can do this by recognizing that it is unconscionable for someone to\r\ndefend
    the right to follow his conscience, then deny that very same\r\nright to someone
    else. Such moral hypocrisy is compounded when those\r\ndenying the autonomy of
    others are professionals, and those they are\r\ndenying are the citizens or patients
    they are sworn to serve.\r\n\r\nFor politicians, this means thinking twice about
    using a conscience vote\r\nto pass a law that denies citizens the right to act
    on their consciences\r\nwhen terminally ill, facing an unplanned pregnancy or
    seeking to\r\nconceive using ARTs.\r\n\r\nFor medical professionals, it means
    ensuring that all conscience clauses\r\nin legislation include an obligation to
    refer. That is, where the law\r\narticulates the right of doctors, nurses and
    pharmacists to refuse\r\ntreatment on grounds of conscience, it must also spell
    out the\r\nobligations of professionals to ensure the needs of their patients
    are\r\nmet elsewhere. Pro-life groups continue to resist such basic demands,\r\nthough
    medicos tend to be on board. A recent letter to all Victorian MPs\r\nsigned by
    a number of religious leaders spent paragraphs detailing the\r\nextensive rights
    of health care workers to refuse treatment on grounds\r\nof conscience, and just
    one sentence tartly rejecting the idea these\r\nproviders had any obligation to
    refer. In contrast, the ethical practice\r\nguidelines of the Royal Australian
    and New Zealand College of\r\nObstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) instructs
    its members to\r\nâ\x80\x9Coffer or arrange a further opinion and/or ongoing care
    with another\r\nsuitable practitioner ifâ\x80¦the therapy required is in conflict
    with [your]\r\npersonal belief/value system.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nWith all rights come
    obligations, and the freedom to follow oneâ\x80\x99s\r\nconscience is no exception.
    As members of our community, politicians and\r\nhealth care workers are as entitled
    as the rest of us to live their\r\nlives according to their values.\r\n\r\nBut
    because they are professionals, these rights come with significant\r\nresponsibilities,
    responsibilities that come down to a requirement that\r\nthose who act from conscience
    live by the golden rule.\r\n\r\nDo unto others as you would have them do to you."
