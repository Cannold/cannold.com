Informa Australia in conjunction with the Banking and Finance Oath Initiative invites you to a day on ethics in financial services. A conference where you will hear from your peers, industry experts and the brightest minds on the importance of establishing an ethical system within the financial system.

Who should attend? Bank executives, politicians, the regulators, ombudsmen services, financial services professionals, industry practitioners, consumer advocates, academia, HR professionals in banking & finance and the media.

Why attend? Despite scandals, misconduct and the GFC our banks performed well, but not without damage to reputation or the loss of consumer confidence. The scandals are real, consumers furious and rightly so, leaving investors nervous and uncertain. The debate on whether a royal commission into banking is required continues. We will attempt to shed light on the heart of the issues, providing much needed insight to ensure the industry can move ahead with confidence.

This event is open to the public. For more information, keep your eye on the Informa website, which is hosting this event in conjunction with the Banking and Finance Oath Initiative. The BFO oath is as follows:

The Oath Trust is the foundation of my profession.

I will serve all interests in good faith. I will compete with honour. I will pursue my ends with ethical restraint. I will help create a sustainable future. I will help create a more just society. I will speak out against wrongdoing and support others who do the same. I will accept responsibility for my actions.

In these and all other matters; My word is my bond. i
