    and then weâ\x80\x99ll see whose â\x80\x98privateâ\x80\x99 lifestyle choices are
    actually worth reporting.\r\n\r\nSuch as: Which A-List Hollywood superstars have
    had an abortion?\r\n\r\nNow that would be a story that counted for something.
    Right?\r\n\r\nLatest figures that show one in about 50 American women of childbearing
    age have ended a pregnancy. The same study found the west and northeast of the
    country topped the rate scale.\r\n\r\nSo youâ\x80\x99d think that over in Hollywood,
    on the west coast, thereâ\x80\x99d be more than a few stars with a personal story
    to tell.\r\n\r\nAnd youâ\x80\x99d think, given that nearly every other aspect
    of said personal lives are routinely revealed in tell-all glory, that a celebrity
    encounter with an abortion clinic would actually be a story of public interest.\r\n\r\nYet
    I couldnâ\x80\x99t think of a famous face who hasnâ\x80\x99t kept mum on the issue
    yet talk freely about everything else. Like their weird diet secrets or sex habits.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nIn
    the early days of Hollywood, when celebrity journals fawned over stars, film historian
    Anthony Slide told Slate starlets ending pregnancies were reported to be â\x80\x9Chaving
    their appendix removedâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nIn 1991, Whoopi Goldberg spoke of going
    to a park with a coathanger as a 14-year-old girl in a book called The Choices
    We Made.\r\n\r\nThe author writes her book was published â\x80\x9Con the heels
    of two U.S. Supreme Court decisions restricting a woman's access to abortionâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nIn
    2006, feminist publication Ms. Magazine featured Judging Amy actress Amy Brenneman,
    among others, in a story called We Had Abortions.\r\n\r\nIt came during a watershed
    moment for the abortion-rights cause, fuelled by fears South Dakotans would vote
    to ban virtually all abortions in their state, even in cases of rape and incest.\r\n\r\nRecently,
    abortion in the US has managed to creep into the national conversation though
    proposed budget funding cuts to the Planned Parenthood birth control program didnâ\x80\x99t
    include abortion.\r\n\r\nStill, Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johannsen said something
    about the issue, sort of.\r\n\r\nLooking closer to home, life in a time when abortion
    was an illegal taboo is back in the consciousness, thanks to a TV show about sexual
    revolution in magazines. Indeed, the sexual and social rights of women are again
    in the spotlight thanks to a few notable â\x80\x98scandalsâ\x80\x99 bred of subcultures
    that promote that same kind of patriarchy that shushed talk about â\x80\x98womenâ\x80\x99s
    businessâ\x80\x99 and women in general. \r\n\r\nLast week, Kerry Petersen, associate
    professor at La Trobe Universityâ\x80\x99s School of Law, said Australia risked
    returning to the â\x80\x9Cbackyard abortion of yesteryearâ\x80\x9D unless changes
    to the law were made. Dr Petersen called for reform with reference to last yearâ\x80\x99s
    high-profile Cairns abortion couple case. **Women's rights activist Leslie Cannold
    pitched a similar argument at the same time.**\r\n\r\nSo now is as good a time
    as any to start looking at why there isnâ\x80\x99t more openness about an issue
    that, at most recent, sketchy estimate, affects about the same number of women
    here as in America.\r\n\r\nAnd why not start with this blog?\r\n\r\nI have not
    had an abortion. Iâ\x80\x99ve had a few sleepless nights punctuated with panicked
    Google searches and visions of clandestine trips to Canberra under the cover of
    darkness. Iâ\x80\x99m not sure what upset me most: the fact of the matter; that
    I was so panicked; that I was considering making a decision that could land me
    in jail; or that I couldnâ\x80\x99t think of the last time I had an open, honest,
    reasonable conversation about abortion.\r\n\r\nWhat about you?\r\n\r\nIs abortion
    a subject you feel you can talk about? Do you feel you should talk about it? Who
    should you discuss it with? And do you feel that thereâ\x80\x99s a problem with
    an entertainment industry that will sell sex, but wonâ\x80\x99t deal with the
    consequences?\r\n\r\nAnd please. Be respectful.\r\n"
