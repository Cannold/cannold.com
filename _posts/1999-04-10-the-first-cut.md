  content: "TO circumcise our sons or not? Before our first children were born, a\r\nJewish
    friend and I argued the question. Our non-Jewish partners looked\r\non, unsure
    what the fuss was about.\r\n\r\nWhile 80 per cent of Australian boys were circumcised
    in the 1960s, only\r\none in 10 is today. The medical profession that performed
    most\r\ncircumcisions and promoted the procedure as more hygienic, now advises,\r\nin
    the absence of cultural and religious reasons, against the procedure.\r\nWhile
    this position has a tolerant ring, a Jewish couple I know\r\nencountered hostility
    from numerous medical practitioners who refused to\r\ncircumcise, and actively
    sought to discourage them going elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut subtle â\x80\x9Cbad parentâ\x80\x9D
    accusations from the medical establishment donâ\x80\x99t\r\nworry me. What does
    are claims that infants subconsciously remember the\r\nviolation of the trust
    they experienced when their mothers abandoned\r\nthem to the pain of circumcision.
    I worry my boy may be teased by his\r\nmates for looking different. That he may
    resent the inalterable choice\r\nwe have made about his body. A choice, say opponents
    of circumcision,\r\nthat sacrifices (in the true Bibilical sense of the word)
    male sexual\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nOur plumber, and a policeman we know have circumcised
    their boys so\r\ntheyâ\x80\x99ll â\x80\x9Clook like their Dadâ\x80\x9D. But for
    Jews the issue is more complex.\r\nThe two most observed Jewish customs of even
    the most non-religious Jews\r\nare circumcision and burial in a Jewish cemetery.
    Belief in the\r\nimportance of circumcision as a mark of Jewish identity, and
    so of\r\ndifference, explains why some Jews find the imperative to circumcise\r\neven
    more compelling in periods - like now - when it is out of favor\r\namong non-Jews.
    Jews circumcise not because it is fashionable, the\r\nthinking goes, but because
    it is the mark of convenant between God and\r\nthe Jewish people. Jews circumcise
    because it reflects what we believe\r\nand who we are. Jews circumcise because
    they are Jews.\r\n\r\nIN THE biographical film Europa Europa, Shlomo Perel feigns
    Aryan\r\nidentity as he waits out the war in a school for Hitler youth. Afraid
    of\r\nbeing discovered, longing to fit in with the other young men, Shlomo\r\nties
    a string around his penis in an attempt to re-grow his foreskin.\r\nAlthough his
    circumcision repeatedly endangers his life, the film makes\r\nit clear that it
    saves Shlomoâ\x80\x99s soul. Unable to blend in and forget he\r\nis a Jew, Shlomo
    is forced to resist his temptation to identity with -\r\nand so be complicit in
    - the evil of the Nazis.\r\n\r\nAs an ethicist and a feminist, I hate the idea
    of circumcision. As a\r\nsecular Jew, I find the argument about circumcisionâ\x80\x99s
    symbolic value\r\ncompelling. I like the idea that circumcision offers boys a
    physical\r\nreminder of who they are, and where they belong.\r\n\r\nYet I am also
    sceptical. As a woman, I lack the â\x80\x9Cmark of the convenantâ\x80\x9D,\r\nyet
    have never felt tempted to forget or forsake my Jewish identity.\r\nDuring the
    Holocaust, male circumcision meant that the most\r\ngentile-looking women were
    most often sent beyond the ghetto to deliver\r\nmessages and search for food and
    water. While remaining beyond the walls\r\nwould no doubt have helped many of
    these women to survive, no stories\r\nexist of large numbers of them forsaking
    those awaiting their return.\r\nPerhaps, then, circumcision is but a physical
    reminder of the more\r\nimportant psychic cut that being raised Jewish makes on
    the soul.\r\n\r\nFor me, the real dilemma comes from the strange confluence of\r\ncircumstances
    that have seen me marry and bear children far from my\r\nnative New York. Ten
    years in Australia have led me to believe that the\r\nlargely secular way I took
    on a Jewish identity has few parallels here.\r\nIn the suburb outside Manhattan
    in which I grew up, amid a Jewish\r\nAmerican community that numbered millions,
    there were a myriad ways to\r\nparticipate and identify as a Jew. My family considered
    themselves\r\nReform Jews - the least observant level of a three-tiered system
    in\r\nwhich Conservative and Orthodox are the middle and highest rungs.\r\n\r\nWe
    rarely set foot in Temple. Yet while my parents were agnostics, they\r\nwere unremittingly
    enthusiastic about being Jewish. For them that meant\r\neating bagels, lox and
    cream cheese at our Sunday family brunches, and\r\nscrutinising and rejoicing
    in our every educational accomplishment. It\r\nalso meant refusing my yearly entreaties
    to buy a Christmas tree and\r\nfairy lights, and feeling slightly offended on
    the rare instances we\r\nreceived cards wishing us a Merry Christmas, rather than
    the more\r\nneutral Holiday Greetings.\r\n\r\nWhen pushed, my parents thought
    it would be â\x80\x9Cniceâ\x80\x9D if I chose to\r\ncircumcise the baby, but they
    didnâ\x80\x99t see circumcision as critical to his\r\nidentity. Technically they
    are right. Being born of a Jewish mother, not\r\ncircumcision, makes a boy Jewish.
    They also knew that in the US, Britain\r\nand Israel, a small but vocal group
    of Jews are now opposing\r\ncircumcision. A Jewish scholar recently wrote a book,
    endorsed by five\r\nliberal Jewish rabbis, arguing against the practice. My parents\r\nbelieved,
    in other words, that an uncircumcised boy in New York would\r\nstill be accepted
    by our Jewish peers as a Jew.\r\n\r\nBut in Melbourne things are somewhat different.
    The Jewish community is\r\nsmall and even its most liberal Reform branches would
    be considered\r\nConservative in America. Those who in the past have raised circumcision\r\nas
    an issue for debate have not, in the main, been kindly received.\r\nWhether this
    stance is wise or foolish, it is the way things are. The\r\nway I grew up being
    Jewish means I will always be an outsider in this\r\ncommunity. I can live with
    this - my Jewish identity is formed and is\r\nnow self-sustaining. But I worry
    that by not circumcising my boys I am\r\nmaking them outsiders too. And this Jewish
    community is the only one\r\nthey will ever really know.\r\n\r\nMy friend is also
    an outsider in the local Jewish community, but while\r\nhe agreed with many of
    my concerns about circumcision, and worried about\r\ncausing his baby son pain,
    he never really considered not circumcising.\r\nBecause his wife isnâ\x80\x99t
    Jewish, they were ineligible for a bris, the\r\nceremonial circumcision eight
    days after the birth. Instead, they spent\r\nseveral weeks finding a doctor who
    would agree to circumcise. My friend\r\nhad to hold the baby down, while his partner
    waited outside, listening\r\nto the babyâ\x80\x99s screams from the other side
    of the door.\r\n\r\nThey say they have no regrets, and I believe them. They traded
    their\r\nbabyâ\x80\x99s fleeting pain for his entrance into the history and tradition
    of\r\nthe Jewish people. I believe in this tradition and want to be part of\r\nits
    preservation. I hear the voices of the Orthodox, asking, â\x80\x9CWho are\r\nyou
    to pick and choose among our traditions?â\x80\x9D But each time I tried to\r\nimagine
    the doctor or mohel - the ritual performer of the circumcision\r\nrite - moving
    towards my baby to make the cut, I baulked. Like my friend\r\nwho knew he must
    circumcise, I came to know I could not. There were\r\nreasons for and against,
    but in the end it came down to the small voice\r\nin my head that kept saying
    â\x80\x9Cnoâ\x80\x9D."
