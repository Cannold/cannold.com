  content: "Taking a tiny risk can serve overall community interests.\r\n\r\nTHE horror
    of the case in which a Melbourne girl was infected with the\r\nHIV virus through
    an anonymous blood donation, graphically demonstrates\r\nthe clash between the
    best interests of the public and the best\r\ninterests of a particular individual
    - in this case, a child.\r\n\r\nBy definition, it is the obligation of public
    health officials to\r\nrecommend that the community adopt behavior that is in
    the best\r\ninterests of the public overall. Public health officials cannot, and\r\nshould
    not, make behavioral recommendations based on risk assessments\r\nfor particular
    individuals.\r\n\r\nWhen the Red Cross rejected the attempts of the girlâ\x80\x99s
    father and mother\r\nto donate blood for her operation, they did so in line with
    studies\r\ndemonstrating that overall, blood recipients are more likely to avoid\r\nHIV
    if transfused with anonymous, rather than \\`\\`directedâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99, donations.\r\n\r\nBut
    while the Red Cross cannot make individual risk assessments for each\r\npatient
    needing blood, parents can make such assessments for their\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nIn
    the Melbourne case, the parents did just that. Satisfied that they\r\nhad not
    engaged in any high-risk behavior in the 22-day period in which\r\nHIV infection
    cannot be detected, these parents sought to lower the odds\r\nof HIV infection
    for their daughter - from infinitesimal to none.\r\n\r\nBehind all public health
    risk management strategies around HIV/AIDS, is\r\nthe promulgation of distrust
    of oneâ\x80\x99s sexual partners, lovers and\r\nspouses. No matter what the status
    or longevity of a relationship,\r\npeople are advised to wear a condom \\`\\`every
    timeâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 in order to avoid\r\ninfection. Sharing needles is also
    a no-no, no matter how vehemently a\r\nfellow user asserts their HIV-negative
    status.\r\n\r\nSuch promotions emphasise the impossibility of a person knowing
    his or\r\nher HIV status, or the status of those with whom she has sex or injects\r\ndrugs,
    not the purposeful duplicity of those claiming to be virus-free.\r\nBut while
    a \\`\\`trust no oneâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99 stance may be appropriate among strangers\r\nor
    acquaintances, when applied to intimate relationships such as those\r\nbetween
    spouses, it has the hard and unpleasant edge of an X-file.\r\n\r\nI have no reason
    to doubt Red Cross claims that overall, everyone would\r\nbe better off if they
    gave and accepted anonymous, rather than directed,\r\ndonations. When his niece
    is faced with life-threatening surgery is not\r\nthe time Uncle Joe - the only
    compatible donor - is likely to reveal he\r\nhad sex with other men, is an intravenous
    drug-user, or is involved in\r\nother high-risk behaviors.\r\n\r\nBut if it was
    my child who needed blood, I feel confident I could trust\r\nmyself, my husband
    or numerous other family members who might be\r\ncompatible donors to be straight
    about their suitability to donate. In\r\nbypassing an anonymous donation in favor
    of a directed one, I would be\r\nacting in accordance with a personalised risk
    assessment strategy that -\r\nas a parent - I would feel duty-bound to make.\r\n\r\nBut
    while I would not be dissuaded from this position by public health\r\nassertions
    that there is no difference between what is in the best\r\ninterests of my child
    and of the larger community, I might be influenced\r\nby another public interest-type
    argument. As an ethicist, I would find\r\nit difficult to resist appeals to my
    sense of duty to act - as an\r\nindividual - as I know others must act if we are
    all to achieve the best\r\ncommunity health outcomes.\r\n\r\nAs a parent, I seek
    to install such a sense of community obligation in\r\nmy own children. Recently,
    my little one came home with a tiny animal\r\nfigurine from the child-care farm
    set. He knew it was unlikely to be\r\nmissed, and wanted to keep it at home. \\`\\`What
    if every child took a\r\nfigurine home?â\x80\x98â\x80\x99 I asked, putting it
    near the front door to be returned\r\nthe following day. \\`\\`Eventually thereâ\x80\x99d
    be no farm animals for anyone\r\nto play with.â\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\n\r\nShould
    the option of giving a directed donation become available in\r\nVictoria, undermining
    the veracity of the personal risk assessment\r\nstrategy I have made for my child,
    would not convince me to bypass this\r\noption. But appealing to my sense of community
    obligation might persuade\r\nme, and other thinking people engaged in low-risk
    behaviors, to put\r\nthose they love at a tiny, tiny risk in order to model behavior
    that\r\nbest serves the overall interest of our community."
