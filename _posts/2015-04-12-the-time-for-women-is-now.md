  content: "*The campaign for gender equity needs bold ideas, powerful technology
    and the potent rage of a new generation*\r\n\r\nWhen I was a girl growing up in
    Regan America, I yearned to have been born in different times. To me, the 1960s
    seemed to be a golden era of egalitarianism and inclusivity, far more aligned
    with my own values than the â\x80\x9Cgreed is goodâ\x80\x9D mentality that was
    dominating the 1980s. \r\n\r\nOnly now do I recognise that it is those born from
    1965 that are truly blessed. Gen X, Y and the post-millennials have opportunities
    to redistribute power and achieve radical equality that was inconceivable to previous
    generations. Not since the dawn of human time have the downtrodden had such significant
    and plentiful opportunities to bypass the restraints of self-interested power,
    define liberation on their own terms, and achieve it. \r\n\r\nWhy? Because to
    quote American self-help speaker and author Earl Nightingale: â\x80\x9CEverything
    begins with an idea.â\x80\x9D Before African-American civil rights activist Medgar
    Evers was assassinated in 1963 for his brave stand against racism, he declared,
    \"You can kill a man, but you can't kill an idea.\" Even Stalin understood the
    power of this, noting, â\x80\x9CIdeas are far more powerful than guns. We don't
    let our people have guns. Why should we let them have ideas?â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIf
    ideas are a key ingredient in the â\x80\x9Cchange the worldâ\x80\x9D recipe, then
    digital and communications technologies that allow those ideas to penetrate quickly
    and widely are potent indeed. Those currently holding the reins of power describe
    such technologies as â\x80\x9Cdisruptiveâ\x80\x9D. Those seeking to see that power
    distributed more fairly might choose words like â\x80\x9Cemancipatingâ\x80\x9D
    or â\x80\x9Cliberatingâ\x80\x9D. But whatever the term is used, the potential
    for change remains the same. Instability and critical mass are the preconditions
    for the paradigm shifts that precede massive social shifts. \r\n\r\nOnce it took
    a year for a monk to copy a book in Latin â\x80\x94 a book which would typically
    be chained to a desk in a library and read by few outside the scholarly elite.
    Today, a few keystrokes can see ideas replicated and ricocheted around the globe.
    The speed and penetration of new ideas radically destabilises all aspects of the
    status quo: what we do, how we do it and our understanding of why. \r\n\r\nSadly,
    most commentators have focused almost exclusively on the downsides of such instability.
    Namely, the feeling of insecurity, dislocation and even fear it can provoke. \r\n\r\nThis
    fear is real, but itâ\x80\x99s not the whole story or even the most important
    part. Instead, we could be focussed on the radical potential such instability
    provides. Namely, the provision of multiple opportunities for â\x80\x9Ctipping
    points,â\x80\x9D or moments where large numbers of people adopt a new behaviour
    and a significant social shift gets underway. \r\n\r\nFor women, the opportunities
    for emancipation offered by the Information Age are legion. We now have the chance
    to use technology to organise and mobilise on issues like equal pay, family-friendly
    working conditions, equal opportunity and abortion rights â\x80\x94 campaigns
    fired up by generations of Australian women before us. \r\n\r\nOur time is now,
    not just because of the extraordinary opportunities offered by the Information
    Age, but because of the special attributes of Generations X and Y who are the
    first of their kind to take the basic justice of the feminist position as read.
    \r\n\r\nAs a feminist educator and activist, I find it energising to observe those
    moments when young people who are initially sceptical that gender inequality persists,
    are presented with irrefutable evidence that it does. Suddenly, they begin to
    see the world differently. It is the potent alchemy of this generationâ\x80\x99s
    bewilderment and rage, coupled with their mastery over the powerful communication
    tools of the 21st century, that lasting gender justice can be achieved. \r\n\r\nSo
    where do educators fit in? The most recent Global Gender Gap Report tells the
    story. Commissioned by the World Economic Forum, the report quantifies gender-based
    disparities across four key areas, including health, education, economy and politics.
    Overall, Australia ranked 24th in the world, with particularly poor scores on
    categories like â\x80\x98Political Empowermentâ\x80\x99 and â\x80\x98Health and
    Survivalâ\x80\x99. However, when it came to measuring gender-based access to education,
    including levels of enrolment and literacy rates, we were ranked number 1. \r\n\r\nAustralian
    educators should be proud of the work they have done in providing equal opportunities
    for girls and women to participate in education at all levels â\x80\x94 and supporting
    them to achieve at least as well as their male counterparts. \r\n\r\nOur challenges
    now is to move with the times, embracing both the tools and our special place
    in human history as more opportunity than threat. The journey has been a marathon
    and we should feel rightly proud of the tracks to gender justice weâ\x80\x99ve
    laid. Let us continue to cheer and applaud our daughters, nieces and granddaughters
    as they grab the baton and continue the race towards victory. "
