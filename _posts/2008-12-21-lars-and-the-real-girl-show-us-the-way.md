  content: "Itâ\x80\x99s that time of the year again. No matter what we believe or\r\ncommemorate,
    December offers most of us a few days off work. A chance to\r\nreflect on what
    really matters in our complex, crowded lives, and how it\r\ncan be nurtured so
    more will grow.\r\n\r\nAn Israelite sage living around the time of Jesus said
    that Jewish\r\nteaching could be summarized as, â\x80\x9CThat which is hateful
    to you, do not\r\ndo to your fellow.â\x80\x9D The rest, said Hillel, was commentary.\r\n\r\nIt
    can be nice to have the take-home message distilled. When that\r\nmessage is the
    Golden Rule, few disagree. Upwards of forty religions,\r\nand a posse of secular
    philosophers, have a version of the claim that\r\ncompassion and love, not holier-than-thou
    judgment, should be central to\r\nethics.\r\n\r\nSometimes though, the sheer ubiquitousness
    of a message can rob it of\r\nits power. It was Stalin who observed that while
    one death is a tragedy,\r\na million is just a statistic. Most of us need stories
    about\r\nthree-dimensional people negotiating real-world dilemmas to fire our\r\nimaginations
    and shift our hearts. Leaving us cold teaches us nothing.\r\n\r\nBecause of this,
    I observed my vow to watch less TV this year. Instead,\r\nI read more, and watched
    more movies. I wanted to stop observing facts\r\nin my head, and understand them
    better through my heart.\r\n\r\nMy favourite read was *The Sorrows of an American*,
    a stunningly written\r\nexploration of the big questions raised by 9â\x80\x9311
    through the reflections\r\nof the bookâ\x80\x99s protagonist on the connections
    between his own\r\npast-personal and historical-and present.\r\n\r\nBut the gong
    goes to *Lars and the Real Girl*, out on DVD this year.\r\n\r\n*Lars and the Real
    Girl* is not about sex, but love of the Golden Rule\r\nsort, despite what a one
    line summary of the plot-small town boy becomes\r\nobsessed with mail order doll-might
    suggest.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that Lars is deluded. He thinks the doll, Bianca,
    is real\r\nand that he is in love with her. The town doctor, also a shrink, thinks\r\nLarsâ\x80\x99
    only hope of recovery is if everyone, including Larsâ\x80\x99 brother Gus,\r\nand
    Gusâ\x80\x99s wife Karin, play along. â\x80\x9CBut everyone will laugh at him,â\x80\x9D
    Gus\r\nprotests. â\x80\x9CAnd you too,â\x80\x9D the doctor agrees.\r\n\r\nBut
    they donâ\x80\x99t. No one laughs. Not Karinâ\x80\x99s friends, or Gusâ\x80\x99s
    workmates\r\n(â\x80\x9CWish I had a woman that couldnâ\x80\x99t talk,â\x80\x9D
    says one. â\x80\x9CShe have a sister?â\x80\x9D\r\ninquires a customer). Even the
    church elders eventually get on board.\r\nâ\x80\x9CWe donâ\x80\x99t want anything
    to do with her,â\x80\x9D protests Arnie. â\x80\x9CSheâ\x80\x99s a golden\r\ncalf.
    And we all know what happened with that.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9COh, for heavenâ\x80\x99s
    sake! Whatâ\x80\x99s the big deal!â\x80\x9D snaps Mrs Grinner,\r\naddressing each
    of the group in turn. â\x80\x9CSally, your cousin puts dresses\r\non his cats.
    Hazel, your nephew gave all his money to a UFO club. Arnie,\r\neveryone knows
    your first wife was a kleptoâ\x80¦These things happen. Lars is\r\na good boy.
    You can depend on me.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nHistory and philosophy tend to focus on
    great moments of choice faced by\r\nimportant people. What I loved about *Lars*
    was its poignant recognition\r\nthat the religious turn foul when they forget
    the Golden Rule, and that\r\nthere is nothing exotic about ethics. They can be
    found in the everyday\r\nacts and omissions of us all.\r\n\r\nI am constantly
    moved by how hard people try to be moral, and how often\r\nthey get it right.\r\n\r\nThanks
