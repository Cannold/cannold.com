    political stage because, quite frankly, Iâ\x80\x99m not sure I could\r\ntake another
    minute of him.\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s not the smirk. My problem is the sense of entitlement.
    The standard\r\nanalysis of Costelloâ\x80\x99s failure to challenge Howard for
    the leadership is\r\nthat he lacked the courage. Peter Costello, said Paul Keating
    back in\r\n2005, has the heart the size of a caraway seed. This is probably true,\r\nbut
    certainly too superficial. Listening to Costello blather on to those\r\nwho care
    about the whys and wherefores of the challenge-that-never-was,\r\nwhat I hear
    is man who didnâ\x80\x99t think he should have to take risks or work\r\nup a sweat
    in order to be appointed - forget about elected to - one of\r\nthe highest offices
    in the land. He seemed to feel others should simply\r\nrecognise his obvious qualifications
    for the post and hand it over, tied\r\nwith a bow.\r\n\r\nCostelloâ\x80\x99s post
    ministerial career reeks of the same sense of nobless\r\nself-oblige. While writers
    around the nation wait tables or sell socks\r\nor try and squeeze in few hours
    at the computer late at night after\r\ntheir day job is done and the kids are
    asleep, he rakes in a\r\nback-bencherâ\x80\x99s salary while unapologetically
    writing his memoirs. No\r\nneed for Peter to scrape about for a rare and piddling
    literature grant\r\nthat other writers would make Faustian deals to secure despite
    the fact\r\nthey barely cover the rent. Heâ\x80\x99ll just let the people of Higgins
    cover\r\nit. And if they donâ\x80\x99t like it? Well, off with their heads.\r\n\r\nApparently,
    this sort of tacit tax-payer literary retreat is the Member\r\nfor Higginsâ\x80\x99
    due, given all he had â\x80\x9Ccontributedâ\x80\x9D during this time of\r\noffice.
    Apparently he is entitled to stay in the seat of Higgins for as\r\nlong as he
    wants until plans for his future career moves have\r\nsolidified. Or so say key
    members of the Canberra Press gallery, who\r\ncontinue to report - with no sign
    of concern or alarm - on the â\x80\x9CSalary\r\nAccepted but No One Homeâ\x80\x9D
    sign that has been on the former Treasurerâ\x80\x99s\r\noffice door for close
    to a year.\r\n\r\nWell Iâ\x80\x99m alarmed. Alarmed and aghast. I mean this is
    the man who, with\r\nhis now-nemesis John Howard, spoke in glowing terms about
    programs like\r\nwork for the dole because they reflected the â\x80\x9Cbenefits
    of mutual\r\nobligation.â\x80\x9D This from a key point man in a government that
    routinely\r\ndisparaged those on welfare as â\x80\x9Cdole bludgers,â\x80\x9D and
    criticised\r\nAustralians who didnâ\x80\x99t move interstate to find work as â\x80\x9Cjob
    snobs.â\x80\x9D This\r\nfrom a man who insisted the unemployed become more â\x80\x9Cself-sufficient,â\x80\x9D\r\nand
    that welfare benefits be understood as a â\x80\x9Csocial support in a time\r\nof
    need, not a permanent handout.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nCostello isnâ\x80\x99t unemployed
    but if there was any justice in the world, he\r\nwould be. Out on his ass in a
    pile of snow streaked yellow with dog pee.\r\nIâ\x80\x99ve worked in a number
    of places in my time, but none where I had the\r\noption to throw aside the job
    description so I could use the office\r\nspace to focus on things I found more
    lucrative and interesting.\r\n\r\nThat a Federal MP gets away with cheating his
    electorate of a\r\nrepresentative more interested in improving their life stories
    than\r\ntelling his, while they foot the bill-a sort of job-bludging that if we\r\nwere
    in his shoes and he were still Treasurer he would surely have\r\ncondemned - shames
