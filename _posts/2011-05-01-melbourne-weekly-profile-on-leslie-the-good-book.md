    Cannold doesnâ\x80\x99t shy away from controversy â\x80\x93 she welcomes it. So
    itâ\x80\x99s no surprise that her first novel, The Book of Rachael, is about the
    women of Nazareth â\x80\x93 in particular, the sister of Jesus.\r\nSpend five
    minutes with Cannold, best known as an outspoken commentator on womenâ\x80\x99s
    reproductive rights, and it becomes clear that her passion for giving a voice
    to worthwhile causes extends to those who lived 2000 years ago, a time when she
    says women â\x80\x98â\x80\x98were treated like animalsâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nThe
    existence of Jesusâ\x80\x99 siblings has long been a subject of debate and is
    denied by the Catholic Church. But Cannold, widely regarded as one of Australiaâ\x80\x99s
    top public intellectuals, says the idea for her book was sparked while watching
    a BBC documentary series called Son of God.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x98â\x80\x98The programs
    were about Jesus, the man â\x80\x93 not the religious figure â\x80\x93 a poor
    Jewish peasant about whom I knew next to nothing,â\x80\x99â\x80\x99 says Cannold,
    who describes herself as a secular Jew. â\x80\x98â\x80\x98I certainly hadnâ\x80\x99t
    known he had four brothers whose names and life journeys had been carefully recorded
    for posterity.â\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\n\r\nBut when she learned that the names of
    Jesusâ\x80\x99 sisters were not known, nor, indeed whether he even had any (â\x80\x98â\x80\x98they
    wouldnâ\x80\x99t have been deemed important enough to recordâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99)
    she became irked and resolved to write their story. But she quickly discovered
    that was easier said than done. Her research revealed nothing on which she could
    base even an article, let alone a book.\r\n\r\nUndeterred, she decided: â\x80\x98â\x80\x98Iâ\x80\x99ll
    just write a novel instead.â\x80\x99â\x80\x99 But even then she faced a few hurdles.\r\n\r\nSince
    travel for research wasnâ\x80\x99t an option at the time, she had to rely on her
    memories. Born and raised in America, she had travelled to Israel twice as a teenager
    and had lived on a kibbutz at 17. So she dug out all her old photos and taped
    them all around her computer, cursing herself for not taking more and â\x80\x98â\x80\x98being
    so careless with the anglesâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nShe drew more inspiration
    from photographic books on Israel and its people, and websites that offered maps
    and informed conjecture on what the natural and man-made terrain might have looked
    like 2000 years ago.\r\n\r\nBut Cannold needed not just an accurate picture of
    the setting, but also the correct expressions used for activities such as â\x80\x98â\x80\x98making
    love, falling ill or growing oldâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99. She set about reading the
    gospels to absorb the rhythm of the language.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x98â\x80\x98But I also
    knew it was important not to have too much ye olde language because it starts
    to annoy readers and confuse them.â\x80\x99â\x80\x99 Reading, she stresses, should
    be fun, not hard work.\r\n\r\nThe biggest hurdle was silencing her inner academic,
    which niggled whenever she tried to write anything beyond research-based facts.
    She jokes that it was all she could do to leave off footnotes.\r\n\r\nWhen she
    gave the first draft to a friend, he told her it contained too many precisely
    drawn facts and didnâ\x80\x99t work as a novel. So she went back to the drawing
    board and concentrated on writing a story, including historical facts only when
    really necessary.\r\n\r\nThe result was worth the effort. Cannoldâ\x80\x99s tale
    imagines the back story and de-mystifies the life of â\x80\x98â\x80\x98Joshuaâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99
    (Jesus) of Nazareth, taking known events and establishing plausible explanations
    for the miraculous and larger-than-life, told from the perspective of his sister,
    Rachael.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x98â\x80\x98Why I havenâ\x80\x99t received Santa sacks full
    of expletive-filled, hand-written missives from outraged Christians remains a
    mystery,â\x80\x99â\x80\x99 Cannold says, laughing.\r\n\r\nBut while Cannold can
    probably still expect a terse email from the Vatican, she says itâ\x80\x99s the
    sex scenes that stood out for her teenage sons. Not that they are opposed to sex
    scenes per se â\x80\x93 only ones written by their mother. â\x80\x98â\x80\x98No
    one likes to think of their parents in that way,â\x80\x99â\x80\x99 she says, laughing.
    â\x80\x98â\x80\x98My younger son said: â\x80\x98Theyâ\x80\x99re a bit graphicâ\x80\x99
    ... Heâ\x80\x99s marked the pages so his brother can skip them.â\x80\x99â\x80\x99\r\n\r\nLooking
    back, Cannold says writing sex scenes sucks.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x98â\x80\x98The upside
    is that whenever a fellow scribe starts snivelling about some difficulty they
    have with their work, I just tell â\x80\x99em not to come the raw prawn with me.
