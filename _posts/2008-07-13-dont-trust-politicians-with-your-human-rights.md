    of human rights, but it isnâ\x80\x99t so.\r\n\r\nHaving come of age in the land
    of the free, I had witnessed first hand\r\nthe social ructions caused by the Supreme
    Courtâ\x80\x99s invalidation of laws\r\nthat violated the Bill of Rights. During
    my lifetime, I watched my\r\ncountry struggle to come to terms with the Supreme
    Courtâ\x80\x99s banning as\r\nunconstitutional of racially segregated schools,
    its upholding of the\r\nseparation of Church and State and its striking down of
    laws banning\r\nabortion.\r\n\r\nIn principle, I agreed with each one of these
    decisions, yet as a new\r\nmigrant to Australia in the early 1990s, I thought
    this nationâ\x80\x99s more\r\nincrementalist approach to social change had much
    to commend it. I\r\nthought, for example, that it may have been the less radical\r\nliberalisation
    of abortion laws in this country in the early 1970s that\r\nkept the issue off
    the political agenda, in contrast to the US where Roe\r\nv. Wadeâ\x80\x99s assertion
    of a womanâ\x80\x99s right to choose had sparked the\r\ncreation of a violent
    and tireless anti-choice opposition.\r\n\r\nI was wrong. The wishy-washy refusal
    of Australiaâ\x80\x99s varied abortion laws\r\nto dignify women as choosers did
    little to stop John Howard putting the\r\nissue firmly on the political agenda,
    where it has remained ever since.\r\nMore importantly, I discovered that the American
    take on human rights is\r\njust one of many. Australia is now the only democratic
    nation without a\r\nrights charter and many nations, including the UK, have devised
    rights\r\nprotection frameworks that are upside rich, and downside poor.\r\nFrameworks
    that depart from the American example by defending the\r\nexisting power ratio
    between parliament and the courts while enabling a\r\nreasonable balancing of
    the individual rights of citizens and the\r\ncollective wishes and entitlements
    of the majority.\r\n\r\nHereâ\x80\x99s how it could work. First, parliament would
    pass a law defining\r\nthe civil, political, economic, cultural and/or social
    rights of\r\nAustralians. From that point on, all bills would be checked against
    this\r\nlist of human rights. Where a bill is deemed incompatible, Parliament\r\nmust
    formally explain how and why, though it can still become law.\r\n\r\nThe Courts
    would also perform their interpretive role with an eye to\r\nhuman rights. Where
    a law appears in incompatible with the rights\r\ncharter, the Courts could ask
    Parliament to reconsider it, but could not\r\nstrike it down.\r\n\r\nSo far, arguments
    against a Human Rights Act for Australia have been few\r\nand weak. This is not
    surprising, given the essential challenge of those\r\nin the â\x80\x9Cnoâ\x80\x9D
    camp is to explain why our elected representatives should\r\nnot even be asked
    to consider human rights, little less uphold them. The\r\nmain line of argument
    has been to claim that the existing system has\r\ndone such a good job of protecting
    our rights so far, there is no need\r\nto fix it.\r\n\r\nHmmm. I suspect that
    David Hicks, Cornelia Rau and refugee children\r\nliving in detention would disagree.
    And this is the point: that while a\r\nHuman Rights charter would leave ultimate
    legislative power in the hands\r\nof MPs, it would require them to exercise that
    power more methodically,\r\nprogressively and transparently, something that many
    seem keen to avoid.\r\n\r\nThat is why David Marr reminds us that we would be
    wise to treat\r\npoliticians who object to human rights charter with the same
    seriousness\r\nthat we would burglars who object to alarm systems. Not, in other
    words,\r\nvery seriously at all."
