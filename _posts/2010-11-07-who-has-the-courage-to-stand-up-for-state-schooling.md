  content: "Are there big ideas in Australian politics any more? Or big politicians\r\nwith
    big principles and the wit and courage to stand by - and for -\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nThe
    answer may be â\x80\x9Cnoâ\x80\x9D. The forces decimating visionary and moral\r\nleadership
    include the hollow machine men running the main parties,\r\ntheir small target
    pre-election strategies of pacification and divide\r\nand rule, and the docile
    and dense political progeny to which corrupt\r\ninternal processes give birth.\r\n\r\nThe
    biggest loser in this political race to the bottom is public\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nIn
    the US, 90 per cent of the children attend public schools. In\r\nAustralia, the
    figure is just 66 per cent and falling, as students\r\nfollow the money flowing
    (with few or no strings attached) from\r\ntaxpayers into the private system. The
    results have led to some private\r\nschool students enjoying as much as a 62 per
    cent edge in resources\r\ncompared with any of their public school peers. They
    also reveal\r\nAustralia as having among the greatest gaps between high- and\r\nlow-performing
    15-year-olds - disparities the Organisation for Economic\r\nCo-operation and Development
    says are owed in large part to the\r\nstudentâ\x80\x99s class, social and family
    background.\r\n\r\nPublic education is all about redressing such inequalities
    of\r\nopportunity that arise from accidents of birth.\r\n\r\nChildren are not
    born equal. Each is unique, and blessed - or cursed -\r\nwith a particular family
    and community. Some will come into the world\r\nhealthy and have two happy, employed
    and otherwise high-functioning\r\nparents. Others may start life struggling with
    poor health or disability\r\nand with parents encumbered by poverty, illness or
    addiction.\r\n\r\nWhat any child gets - genetically or family-wise - is the luck
    of the\r\ndraw. Nearly all Australians would agree that the child should not be\r\nblamed
    or suffer the negative consequences of circumstances beyond his\r\nor her control.\r\n\r\nPublic
    education starts with this agreement and then goes one visionary\r\nand extraordinary
    step further. In the spirit of individual endeavour on\r\nwhich liberal democratic
    countries such as Australia were founded, it\r\nproposes that not only should
    no child suffer the consequences of\r\nunchosen circumstances of birth, but each
    should be granted the same\r\nopportunity to flourish and generally get on in
    life.\r\n\r\nSuch equal opportunity is not construed as a gift, but a birthright,\r\nfounded
    in notions of fairness and equality between all people.\r\n\r\nYet, despite the
    obvious equity issues, loud and proud defenders of\r\nstate schooling are few
    and far between. You canâ\x80\x99t slide a credit card\r\nbetween Labor and Liberal
    on the issue - both parties have created\r\nrapacious political constituencies
    for privileged educational services\r\nthat must now be serviced by the taxpayer
    teat in the run-up to every\r\nelection. There are even murmurs that the Greens
    are facing internal\r\ndissent on the partyâ\x80\x99s principled view that governments
    should\r\nprioritise the public education system and that equity must guide\r\ndecisions
    about funding.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the impact of universal schooling on progressive
    generations of\r\nAustralians has been so profound that we fail to recognise its\r\ncontribution
    to the prosperous, democratic and largely harmonious\r\nsociety Australia is today.\r\n\r\nThis
    may be true but itâ\x80\x99s no excuse. Not for politicians and not for us,\r\nthe
    voters, who must insist on answers from candidates for office about\r\ntheir plans
    to defend them.\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\nA heartwarming addendum. Three days after this
    piece ran and during the\r\nVictorian election campaign, the Labor Premier of
    Victoria John Brumby\r\nannounced a [$200 million dollar funding boost for private\r\nschools](http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/state-election-2010/heat-on-brumby-to-cut-stamp-duty-20101109-17m51.html)."
