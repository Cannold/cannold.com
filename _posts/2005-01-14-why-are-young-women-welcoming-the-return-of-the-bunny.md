  content: "The Playboy symbol is enjoying a resurgence in popularity. What does\r\nthis
    signify?\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s everywhere. In the smartest shops in Acland Street,
    and featuring\r\nin trendy Chapel Street in Prahran. On natty little terry short
    and the\r\nsmart canvas gym-bag purses that are the currently the pinnacle of\r\nstreet-wear
    chic. The Playboy Bunny logo is back. The question is: what\r\ndoes its return
    mean?\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99m going to nail my colours to the mast here. When I see
    that Bunny,\r\nthe image that comes to mind are of tall, large-breasted women
    with\r\nstrap-on fur tails tottering somewhat unsteadily on spike-heels; their\r\npainted
    red lips stretched into a fake-looking smile as a diminutive,\r\nbathrobe-wearing
    Hugh Hefner snakes his wizened, overly tan arms around\r\ntheir waists.\r\n\r\nThe
    Bunny logo also makes me think of Gloria Steinem, who was young and\r\npretty
    enough to go undercover as a Bunny Cocktail waitress at the\r\nPlayboy Club in
    New York City. Though I wasnâ\x80\x99t even born when her expose\r\nof the degrading
    and oppressive conditions women endured working in this\r\nsupposedly glamorous
    job appeared in Esquire in 1963, I was impressed\r\nwith her insights - published
    years later in a collection of essays -\r\ninto the cost of Bunnyhood not just
    to the minority of women who don\r\noverlarge pink ears or pose for centrefolds,
    but to all women who live\r\nin societies where Bunnyhood is seen as a suitable
    career aspiration for\r\nyoung girls of talent.\r\n\r\nThis is what the Bunny
    logo means to me, and perhaps to other\r\nfeminist-minded women and men of my,
    and more mature, vintages. And this\r\nis why I wonâ\x80\x99t buy anything that
    carries it. But Bunny-stamped items are\r\nselling well particularly - according
    to my local shop girl - to women\r\nin their teens and early twenties. The question
    is: why?\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reason is simple, and actually suggests something
    quite\r\npositive. The traditional Playboy model is far more rounded and\r\nhealthy-looking
    than the under-fed, under-slept female form idealised in\r\nso many womenâ\x80\x99s
    magazines. Maybe in wearing the Bunny symbol, what young\r\nwomen are saying is
    that they are proud of their womanly curves, and\r\nprefer them to looking like
    a heroin-addicted stick.\r\n\r\nAnother positive take on the Bunnyâ\x80\x99s return
    is that in donning this\r\nlong-standing symbol of female oppression, women are
    reclaiming it as a\r\nsign of empowerment. In the same way that Gays reclaimed
    as a symbol of\r\nunity and pride the pink triangle that the Nazis used to brand
    and\r\noppress them, young Bunny-wearing women are boldly proclaiming their\r\nfaith
    in a world where Girl Power reigns and feminism - simply because\r\nit is no longer
    needed - is a thing of the past. In such a world girls\r\ncan freely embrace both
    their femininity and sexuality without fear of -\r\nas one Girl-Power scholar
    puts it - its â\x80\x9Cusual worrisome baggage.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nA less optimistic
    interpretation, however, is that womenâ\x80\x99s embrace of\r\nthe Bunny reflects
    their sense of disillusionment with - rather than\r\nempowerment within - the
    post-industrial world in which they are coming\r\nof age. Maybe, more than we
    realise, young women are tuning in when we\r\nolder ones complain of unequal wages,
    sexual harassment,\r\nfamily-unfriendly policies and impenetrable glass ceilings
    at the\r\nworkplace. Perhaps they observe when those zealously guarding the reigns\r\nof
    power either ridicule our distress, or ignore it. For such young\r\nwomen, the
    Playboy symbol may hold out the time-honoured promise that if\r\ntheyâ\x80\x99re
    pretty, â\x80\x9Cput outâ\x80\x9D and otherwise play their cards right, there
    is\r\na way for them to make it to the top of the status and income pile: on\r\nthe
    arm of a wealthy and powerful man.\r\n\r\nSo which interpretation is the correct
    one? The evidence, in my view, is\r\nin favour of the Bunny as a symbol of Girl
    Power. Sure, there are\r\ndifferences in the way the Gay Pride movement reclaimed
    the pink\r\ntriangle and the reappearance of the Bunny logo. The former was a\r\nself-consciously
    political act by a grass-roots activist movement, while\r\nthe latter is nothing
    more than a marketing experiment. Nevertheless,\r\nthere are natty shorts with
    the Bunny on it and many more without -\r\nditto cute handbags - and significant
    numbers of young women are\r\nchoosing to buy the former. Given what we know about
    the optimism of\r\nyouth in general, and the disinterest of so many young women
    in a\r\nfeminism they see as irrelevant to their lives, there is good reason to\r\nbelieve
    that in embracing the Bunny, young women see themselves as\r\nreclaiming male-centred
    ideas of femininity and female sexuality, and\r\nmaking them their own.\r\n\r\nItâ\x80\x99s
    hard not to admire them. Certainly, you canâ\x80\x99t blame them. Given the\r\nchoice
    of viewing the future in such a promising light or as hedged and\r\nbarricaded
    by entrenched, often subterranean but always fiercely\r\ndefended power and privilege,
    who wouldnâ\x80\x99t choose the former? And isnâ\x80\x99t\r\nthe belief that such
    a world can exist, indeed does exist, a necessary\r\nprerequisite for actually
    bringing it about? â\x80\x9CYou go girls,â\x80\x9D I want to\r\ncheer. And so
    I will.\r\n\r\nI just hope theyâ\x80\x99re right."
