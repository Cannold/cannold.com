  content: "Thereâ\x80\x99s always a moment of truth. For me, it came a few weeks
    ago, on my\r\nreturn from the States. \"You look\" an acquaintance gushed as we
    watched our sons tumble across the football field. \"Rest and sunshine really
    suits you.\" \r\n\r\nYeah, sorta. And the relaxers and fillers I had injected
    into various creases and furrows - courtesy of my generous father - helped, too.
    Not that I told her this. A rabbit in the headlights, I took the compliment and
    ran. \r\n\r\nBut now it's bugging me. Look, I know that when it comes to such
    lies, I am far from alone. Gaze at the unlined features of many of the forty and
    fifty year old women in the schoolyard, at the gym, on the TV screen and amongst
    parliamentary hopefuls and members, and ask yourself this. Could they all be telling
    the truth about healthy diets and good genes? \r\n\r\nThe obvious answer - \"no\"
    - prompts another question. Why the cone of silence? Women are frank about wearing
    makeup, laser-treating sunspots, colouring our hair. Why when it comes to what
    the industry calls liquid face-lifts - not to mention the surgical kind - do we
    suddenly go all coy? \r\n\r\nHere are my guesses. Firstly, because no one wants
    to be thought vain. Indeed, for women such a slur carries extra punch because
    vanity - with all its connotations of immodesty and triviality - has long been
    seen as evidence of women's diminished moral capacities.\r\n\r\nFear of being
    tagged a failed feminist also keeps us quiet. Despite the hype, the vast majority
    of educated well-resourced women do identify with the women's movement, and at
    the heart of feminist critiques of what Naomi Wolf called the beauty myth are
    claims about women's rights to be seen, heard and recognised for what we do, not
    what we look like. \r\n\r\nThen there's the real world. But for some feminists,
    its shortcomings offer no excuse for female capitulation, but rather a clarion
    call for individual resistance. Good feminists see furrowed brows, drooping jowls
    - even wayward tufts of hair - as evidence of experience, and the wisdom of our
    years. \r\n\r\nBut women just can't win. Morally vacuous and politically incorrect
    if we do, we may be judged wanting if we don't. When Susan Sarandon and Sharon
    Stone receive standing ovations from chat show audiences for being fifty but looking
    thirty-five, the rest of us are reminded not only that youth and beauty remain
    the main source of female power, but that those who age passively risk judgement
    for \"letting themselves go.\" \r\n\r\nHere's what I think. Ageing makes women
    invisible, on the street and in the boardroom, and being invisible sucks. For
    some of us, such invisibility couldn't come at a worse time. When the costs of
    compromises made to manage work and family - staying home, going part-time, juggling
    - are coming home to roost in career and, for some, marital terms. That we aren't
    going to get as far, soar as high, achieve as much as we planned, is a bitter
    enough pill to swallow. Losing our youth at the same time, and the potential for
    the second chances and happier endings it conjures, rubs salt in the wound. \r\n\r\nIn
    this context, face-lifts - liquid or surgical - ballast a destabalised sense of
    self. So we've got no idea who we are anymore, or where our life is, or should
    be, going. At least when we look in the mirror, a familiar face, not a disintegrating
    stranger, is looking back. \r\n\r\nAnd this point - about what we are and are
    not trying to achieve by filling and smoothing - is critical. As one plastic surgeon
    told me, \"Most women don't want to change anything. They just want to look like
    them.\" Australian cosmetic surgeon Rita Rakus agrees, telling Age reporter Annie
    Lawson last year, \"When you look in the mirror, you want to recognise yourself.
    You don't want this old person staring back.\"\r\n\r\nYes, but what troubles me
    is the shame. Maybe we should, and maybe we shouldn't, but let's talk about it
    for heaven's sake).\r\n\r\nBecause there are two things I do know. One is that
    shame is corrosive\r\nand, left unchallenged, takes years to undo.\r\n\r\nThe
    other is that according to one survey just over half of British\r\nwomen intend
    to have plastic surgery, and 11% have done so already. In\r\nAustralia, around
    50,000 people - mostly women, but a growing number of\r\nmen - go under the knife
    each year, with 260,000 more undertaking\r\nnon-surgical procedures like Botox.\r\n\r\nMight
    doesnâ\x80\x99t make right, but what such figures do imply is that if\r\nface-lifts
    (liquid or solid) really do cross some moral dividing line,\r\nweâ\x80\x99re going
    to have to unearth the motives of the traversing hordes to\r\nget a fix on the
    problem, and find a solution.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, if I can afford it, Iâ\x80\x99m
    going to keep dodging my date\r\nwith destiny. I may even consider surgery some
    day.\r\n\r\nWhat I wonâ\x80\x99t do is rabbit away the next time someone tells
    me I look\r\ngood for my age. The time for truth-telling has come."
