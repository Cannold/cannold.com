    the decision they\r\nmake as legislators about dying-with-dignity laws.\r\n\r\nLaws
    that allow Australians to die with dignity wonâ\x80\x99t compel anyone to\r\nuse
    them. This contrasts with the current situation, in which laws mean\r\nall terminally

    face their own death, even if the choice to die with dignity is\r\nnot one they
    would make personally. Indeed, it is hypocritical for them\r\nto use a conscience
    vote to pass laws that deny a freedom of conscience\r\nto others.\r\n\r\nOpponents
    of dying with dignity will tell you that the core moral\r\nprinciple in a civilised
