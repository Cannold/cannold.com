    people are familiar with at least some of Bob Ellisâ\x80\x99s long\r\nand impressive
    resume. The author of seventeen books, including the\r\nbestselling Goodbye Jerusalem,
    Goodbye Babylon and First Abolish the\r\nCustomer, heâ\x80\x99s also written and
    directed features and documentaries\r\nincluding The Notradamus Kid and Bastards
    from the Bush. Heâ\x80\x99s won or\r\nbeen nominated for numerous honours, including
    the Premierâ\x80\x99s Literary\r\nAward.\r\n\r\nEllis is also a Labour speechwriter
    and quintessential leftie insider.\r\nThese days he works for Bob Carr, gets medical
    referrals from SA Premier\r\nMike Rann, and dines with Natasha (â\x80\x9CTashâ\x80\x9D)
    Stott-Despoja and her\r\n(extravagantly wanting, to Ellisâ\x80\x99s mind) fiancÃ©,
    Ian. He has regular\r\nencounters with political big-wigs who impress him with
    their, â\x80\x9Creason\r\nand skillâ\x80\x9D (Kevin Rudd), the â\x80\x9Csedateâ\x80\x9D
    manner in which they move\r\nâ\x80\x9Csecurely into historyâ\x80\x9D (Whitlam
    and Graham Freudenberg) or their â\x80\x9Crose\r\nlipsâ\x80\x9D and â\x80\x9Cdreamy
    girlish beautyâ\x80\x9D (Maxine McKew and Stott-Despoja). In\r\nreturn, they praise
    him for getting things â\x80\x9Cas usual, dead rightâ\x80\x9D (Susie\r\nAnnus),
    for being â\x80\x9Cold-fashioned, but in a very, very nice wayâ\x80\x9D (fellow\r\nspeechwriter
    Carol Green) and by laughing hysterically at his political\r\nwit (Carr).\r\n\r\nSome
    may find such windows into the personal relationships, intimate\r\nthoughts and
    general comings and goings of contemporary power-brokers\r\noffers welcome relief
    from the recycled press releases and 20-second\r\ngrabs that now substitutes for
    current affairs reporting in this\r\ncountry. Others may see it as nothing more
    than name-dropping from an\r\naging man preoccupied with his own death and anxious
    about his own place\r\n- and the place of the ideas heâ\x80\x99s championed all
    his life - in history.\r\n\r\nMake no mistake about it, Ellis is a good guy. He
    feels for the needy\r\nand is contemptuous of the greedy, and never fails to use
    his influence\r\nto ease the suffering of the most forgotten and abused in Australian\r\nsociety.
    He gave hospitality to Ali Bakhtiyari, the man whose sons fled\r\nfrom detention
    but were refused refuge at the UK Consulate, and vainly\r\nworked his contacts
    to prevent the children being shipped back to\r\nWoomera.\r\n\r\nThere is also
    evidence, on numerous occasions, of a fine turn of phrase.\r\nI love Ellisâ\x80\x99s
    description of taking his two dogs â\x80\x9Cfor a whiffle on the\r\nbeach among
    the seaweed and the gulls and a town meeting of other\r\nyelping dogs near the
    big treeâ\x80\x9D. With a few deft phrases, his\r\ndescription of witnessing an
    IRA bombing in London back in the 1970s,\r\nputs us right there.\r\n\r\nYet death
    confronts us on every page. Ellis admires his motherâ\x80\x99s fight\r\nagainst
    her â\x80\x9Cfinal descentâ\x80\x9D and rages against the dying of his own\r\npersonal
    light. He repeatedly laments the under-appreciation of the\r\ncontributions to
    politics and culture of dead white men he knew\r\npersonally or admired from history
    (does he fear a similar fate?), and\r\nthe denial of legitimacy to the varied
    excuses such men had for failing\r\nto live up to expectations (as he fears he
    has?).\r\n\r\nFor those disinterested in this theme, the text offers little refuge.\r\nWhile
    those who already share Ellisâ\x80\x99s world view may take comfort in his\r\npassionate
    rehearsal of various left-wing lines (heâ\x80\x99s anti-Iraq war,\r\nanti-Israel,
    anti-Bush, and pro asylum-seekers), those needing sustained\r\nand logical argument
    to be persuaded of the wisdom of Ellisâ\x80\x99s assertions\r\nwill be disappointed.
    His attitude seems to be that youâ\x80\x99re either with\r\nhim or aâ\x80\x99gin
    him: if itâ\x80\x99s the former you need no persuasion, while those\r\nin the
    latter camp will never be convinced, anyway. As a consequence,\r\nwhatâ\x80\x99s
    on offer is never weightier than a moment-by-moment recounting of\r\nrecent events
    surrounding the war in Iraq, accompanied by Ellisâ\x80\x99s\r\nevaluation of whether
    any particular political action or attempt at spin\r\nwill â\x80\x9Cplayâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nWhich
    leads me to my final reservation about Night Thoughts and all\r\nbooks of itâ\x80\x99s
    genre (Noam Chomkyâ\x80\x99s 9/11, Gore Vidalâ\x80\x99s Perpetual War for\r\nPerpetual
    Peace): volumes that purport to offer a comprehensive analysis\r\nof a recent
    event by â\x80\x9Ca great thinker of our timeâ\x80\x9D. If journalism is the\r\nfirst
    draft of history, what exactly are such books? They claim to\r\nprovide more than
    the fact-reporting and superficial analysis\r\nnecessarily characteristic of writing
    forced to conform to the 24-hour\r\nnews cycle, yet starved of both distance from
    the event and the\r\nperspective offered by time, their significance can be doubted.
    While\r\nthey are almost certainly catering to a book-buying market desperate
    to\r\nmake sense of our rapidly changing world, I remain sceptical - both in\r\ntheory
    and from experience- about their capacity to deliver.\r\n\r\nA friend currently
    enjoying Night Thoughts says such criticism misses\r\nthe point. â\x80\x9CEllis
    is not trying to say anything particularly new or\r\ninsightful. You read it because
    something big - like the war in Iraq -\r\nhappens and you think to yourself, â\x80\x98Now
    I wonder what a bloke like Ellis\r\nwould think about that?â\x80\x99â\x80\x9D."

  and quintessential leftie insider.\r\nThese days he works for Bob Carr, gets medical
  referrals from SA Premier\r\nMike Rann, and dines with Natasha (â\x80\x9CTashâ\x80\x9D)
  Stott-Despoja and her\r\n(extravagantly wanting, to Ellisâ\x80\x99s mind) fiancÃ©,
  Ian. He has regular\r\nencounters with political big-wigs who impress him with their,
