Breakfast](http://abc.net.au/rn/breakfast/stories/2007/1823570.htm)

Children know that ‘fat’ is more than a physical description of body
mass, but a negative assessment of physical attractiveness and moral
worth. There is a clear connection in the public mind between the
generously-waisted and the indiscreet, the lazy, the pitiful, the
asexual and the wildly out of control.

The teenage years are critical moments for the development of self-
identity and self-esteem. They couldn’t be a worse time to tell kids
that their developing bodies are an eye sore and evidence of poor moral
character.

Fat talk is also doomed to fail. The counterproductive behavioural
circularity that begins with low self-esteem is familiar to addiction
counsellors, and is no less evident in the testimony of the overweight.
It goes something like this: failing to lose weight proves you’re a bad
person, which leads you to need that chocolate bar to comfort yourself
for being so bad.

So, no more preaching about the depravity of fat. Instead, let’s teach
our children how to nurture themselves by eating and behaving in ways
that lead to good health.
