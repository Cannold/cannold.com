    This is as true of the common law and acts\r\npassed by Parliament as it is of
    the moral law. That is why whatever\r\nsympathies we have for donor-conceived
    adult Kimberley Springfieldâ\x80\x99s\r\ndesire to contact her sperm donor, overhauling
    the legal framework\r\ngoverning assisted reproductive technology in the state
    and across the\r\nnation may not be justified.\r\n\r\nWhat is 26-year-old Springfield,
    whose case is before the Victorian\r\nCivil and Administrative Tribunal, seeking?
    She wants the Registry of\r\nBirths, Deaths and Marriages - which manages the
    mandatory and voluntary\r\nregisters containing information about Victorian donors,
    donor-conceived\r\noffspring and their relatives - to identify her donor by seeking\r\ninformation
    from the clinic where he gave sperm under conditions of\r\nanonymity.\r\n\r\nShe
    then wants it to use that information to identify his whereabouts\r\nand to write
    to him advocating the purpose and benefit of the voluntary\r\nregister.\r\n\r\nAs
    Rachel Ellyard, representing the registrar, has made clear, this\r\nrequest goes
    well beyond what is authorised by Victorian law. â\x80\x9CThis\r\nisnâ\x80\x99t
    about the rights and wrongs of why she would want to do that, but\r\nitâ\x80\x99s
    a request that goes far beyond the ART [Assisted Reproductive\r\nTreatment] Act.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThe
    problem for Springfield is that she was conceived before 1988. She\r\nhas put
    information on the voluntary register and hoped her donor would\r\ndo the same.
    But he hasnâ\x80\x99t and she has no way of knowing why. Is it\r\nbecause he doesnâ\x80\x99t
    want to, or doesnâ\x80\x99t know the register exists?\r\n\r\nThis situation differs
    from that faced by children conceived after 1988\r\nbut before 1997, whose donors
    are informed when they use the voluntary\r\nregister to request information about
    them (a request the donor can\r\nrefuse).\r\n\r\nChildren conceived after 1997
    have a right to identifying information\r\nabout their donor once they turn 18.\r\n\r\nIt
    would be nice to equalise the entitlements of the pre~~1988 and\r\npre~~1997 groups.
    But to do this, we would have to violate the legal\r\nassurances that they would
    remain anonymous that were given to men who\r\ndonated before 1988.\r\n\r\nThis
    promise should never have been given. Thank goodness we have\r\nchanged the law
    to ensure only donors willing to be identified are\r\nrecruited.\r\n\r\nThe question
    is whether the needs of donor-conceived children such as\r\nSpringfield are so
    compelling they justify enacting retrospective\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nRetrospective
    legislation is a big no-no. The choices citizens make are\r\nbased on rules in
    place at the time. To alter them and force people to\r\nlive with the consequences
    of a decision they canâ\x80\x99t change and to which\r\nthey did not consent is
    unjust. Worse, it undermines the trust between\r\ncitizens and governments essential
    for a functioning democracy.\r\n\r\nThe unravelling of such trust can cause panic.
    Sperm donors, for\r\ninstance, might start worrying they could be landed with
    financial\r\nresponsibility for a donor-conceived child. After all, they might
    think,\r\nif they welshed on one promise, why not another?\r\n\r\nThe potential
    for injustice, distrust and panic is why utterly\r\ncompelling reasons for retrospective
    legislation are required. I remain\r\nunconvinced such reasons exist to alter
    the recently updated Assisted\r\nReproductive Treatment Act 2008 again.\r\n\r\nSpringfield
    says that without knowledge of her biological father and his\r\ngenetic history
    she has no way of finding her â\x80\x9Cplace of belonging in the\r\nworldâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nSorry?
    Over most of our history, humans have embarked on the quest to\r\ndiscover who
    they are, where they fit and why they matter without sure\r\nknowledge of the
    genetic or social history of their male progenitor.\r\nThis is for the simple
    reason that the identity of the biological father\r\ncould not be definitively
    known. The suggestion that it is impossible\r\nfor an individual to flourish or
    live a meaningful life without this\r\ninformation seems like so much hyperbole.
    \r\n\r\nEvidence also suggests it is a mistake to give too much weight to the\r\ncontribution
    one parentâ\x80\x99s genetics make to the health, identity and life\r\nchances
    of his biological child.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that nature and nurture donâ\x80\x99t
    just determine our\r\nopportunities but also expression of our genes, which the
    science of\r\nepigenetics has shown can be turned on and off by our social\r\nenvironment.
    The advent of new genetic tests that can scan our own DNA\r\nfor hundreds of conditions
    is fast making knowledge of both parentsâ\x80\x99\r\nhealth history irrelevant
    to our own capacity to understand and care for\r\nour health.\r\n\r\nHow many
    are like Springfield, born before 1988 and convinced they\r\ncannot flourish until
    they know their biological father? Research does\r\nnot tell us. Ideally, however
    many there are, Victoria would have\r\nlegislation that supports the particular
    requirements of all\r\ndonor-conceived people to rest easily with their conception
    story.\r\n\r\nThe choices we face are not ideal. Iâ\x80\x99d support a compromise
    that saw\r\nevery Victorian household sent a letter about the voluntary donor\r\nregister,
    so we had more confidence that those not on the register have\r\nrefrained by
    choice.\r\n\r\nBut further trashing the trust between citizens and governments
    by\r\nenacting retrospective legislation (we did this years ago with adoption)\r\nseems
    neither wise nor fair."
