  content: "Parental leave - or maternity leave, as we tiresomely insist on thinking\r\nabout
    it - is back in the news. Australiaâ\x80\x99s National Employment\r\nStandards
    now includes the right of workers to request 12 months of\r\nunpaid parental leave
    in addition to the year to which they are already\r\nentitled. A right to request
    flexible working arrangements to care for a\r\nchild under school age is also
    part of the â\x80\x9CFair Workâ\x80\x9D mix.\r\n\r\nFair? Work? In fact, the new
    provisions arenâ\x80\x99t fair to anyone - not\r\nmothers, fathers or children
    - and they may reduce even further the\r\ntenuous attachment Australian mothers
    have to the workforce. The\r\nessential conundrum of parenthood can be summed
    up simply as this:\r\nworking parents of young children want to be in two places
    at once. They\r\nwant to be caring for their children, and they want (and in most
    cases\r\nneed) to be in paid work.\r\n\r\nThis is not, at its core, a gender problem.
    Young Australian women now\r\nparticipate in the workforce at the same rate as
    men and have similar\r\naspirations with regard to earnings and careers. While
    mothers bear the\r\nbrunt of pregnancy and childbirth, once the cord is cut, fathers,\r\ngrandparents
    and other relatives - not to mention trained child-care\r\nworkers - are all capable
    of providing quality care for children.\r\n\r\nIn countries committed to equality
    between the sexes, the parenthood\r\nconundrum is articulated in gender-neutral
    ways. When Swedenâ\x80\x99s generous\r\nparental leave provisions were taken up
    mostly by mothers, a portion was\r\ndesignated for dads on a use-it-or-lose-it
    basis. This bolstered womenâ\x80\x99s\r\nattachment to the workforce and freed
    men to take the time they said\r\nthey wanted to care for their children, without
    losing points with the\r\nboss.\r\n\r\nLong stretches away from work are bad for
    employees and despised by\r\nemployers. Jobs are restructured out of existence,
    and the lifetime\r\nearnings and superannuation savings of absent workers take
    a hit from\r\nwhich they never recover. It may not be discrimination, but womenâ\x80\x99s
    lack\r\nof hours and experience relative to men - largely due to â\x80\x9Ccareer\r\ninterruptionsâ\x80\x9D
    caused by motherhood - account for the 17 per cent less\r\nthat Australian women
    earn on average compared with men.\r\n\r\nMen and children also miss out when
    women are the only ones to withdraw\r\nfrom paid employment to shoulder the parenting
    load. Australian men\r\nconsistently cite work as a barrier to greater involvement
    with their\r\nchildren, while reports on generation Y men suggest they see sharing
    the\r\nhousework and child care as a moral obligation. Australian children\r\nreport
    missing their largely absent fathers, while research confirms\r\nthat the presence
    of a loving and nurturing dad is as important for a\r\nchildâ\x80\x99s happiness,
    wellbeing, and social and academic success as having\r\na loving and nurturing
    mother.\r\n\r\nThe upshot of all this is that in the absence of carrots and sticks
    to\r\nencourage men to step up and women to step out, it will be Australian\r\nmothers
    who are most likely to take up the Governmentâ\x80\x99s grant of an\r\nadditional
    year of unpaid leave, and to wear the associated financial\r\nand work-related
    consequences.\r\n\r\nThe same can be said about the right to request flexible
    work\r\narrangements. Part-time and flexible hours are an essential but\r\nimperfect
    tool for solving the parenthood conundrum, yet some workplaces\r\ncontinue to
    expect full-time hours from workers on part-time pay, and\r\nthe reduced visibility
    or productivity of the flexible workers often\r\nmeans they are overlooked for
    promotion.\r\n\r\nAgain the problem is equality. If parents of both genders use
    flexible\r\nwork conditions, then the associated costs will fall to both. But
    if\r\nonly mothers are demanding such arrangements, then they become the group\r\nsome
    employers would prefer to avoid hiring, or will choose to\r\nmarginalise on the
    aptly named â\x80\x9Cmummy-trackâ\x80\x9D, while fathers and\r\nchildless workers
    get away scot-free.\r\n\r\nThe Governmentâ\x80\x99s new employment standards are
    not just blind to\r\npersistent inequalities of gender, but to social class as
    well. As Labor\r\nknows, bearing and raising children is expensive. Add to this
    the\r\nsoaring cost of housing, and few Australians have the luxury of having\r\none
    parent not working for years at a time. Any government serious about\r\noffering
    the bulk of Australian parents real opportunities to care for\r\ntheir children
    would ensure that parental leave was paid.\r\n\r\nPaid parental leave has been
    a political football for too long. Last\r\nmonth the National Civic Council took
    Tony Abbott to task for supporting\r\nmaternity (not parental) leave, which it
    sees as part of a feminist\r\nconspiracy â\x80\x9Cto reward women who make feminist-approved
    lifestyle\r\nchoicesâ\x80\x9D. Conservative Christians are able to influence Labor
    as well -\r\nthe party dropped its commitment to paid maternity leave from its\r\nplatform
    before the last election, then flipped the issue to the\r\nneo-liberal Productivity
    Commission to rule on when it won the election.\r\n\r\nWe need to set the squealing
    of minorities aside and put the financial,\r\nsocial and emotional needs of the
    majority of Australian mothers,\r\nfathers and children first.\r\n\r\nAustralian
    mums and dads need, want and have a right to employment and\r\nto share the work
    of looking after their children. Work and care must be\r\nshared and parental
    leave must be paid. It really is as simple as that."
