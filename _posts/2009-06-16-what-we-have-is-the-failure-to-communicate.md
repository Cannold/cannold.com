    the growing incapacity of the planet to sustain us and the threat\r\nposed by
    climate change, our elected decision makers and key corporate\r\nplayers seem
    incapable of doing enough of what is required, to avert the\r\ncoming crisis.\r\n\r\nThis
    has caused despair among many of the climate scientists who\r\nconvened earlier
    this year in Copenhagen. Nine out of 10 of those polled\r\nby The Guardian newspaper
    said they had lost faith in the ability of\r\ndecision makers to take the action
    necessary to restrict global\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThe failure was variously
    blamed on political constraints, social\r\ninertia and the psychological inability
    of human society to manage the\r\ncomplexity, uncertainty and enormity of the
    issue. â\x80\x9CI thought that we\r\ncould convince people,â\x80\x9D said one.
    â\x80\x9CBut I fear that society is not up to\r\nthe challenge of a crisis like
    this.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nSome Australian scientists are similarly despondent. Having
    witnessed\r\nthe failure of empirical data and reason to persuade, academics such
    as\r\nGraeme Pearman are now trying to unearth the elements of human nature\r\nthat
    make it, in his words, â\x80\x9Cso difficult for us to respondâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nBut
    while such an approach is understandable and may have merit, I worry\r\nabout
    the conceptualisation of the inaction problem as one of\r\nunderstanding (because
    everyone knows that when reasonable people\r\nunderstand something, they act on
    it). Also concerning is the tendency\r\nto define the problem as one caused solely
    by others, rather than by\r\nadvocates themselves.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly
    seen in the absence of critical reflection on the\r\ncommunication strategies
    climate scientists and activists have employed\r\nto date to provoke action on
    climate change.\r\n\r\nThere is good evidence that the Australian public is concerned
    about\r\nclimate change and wants decision makers to act.\r\n\r\nNewspaper polls
    show readers nominating the problem as that posing the\r\ngreatest risk to their
    quality of life. A 2007 international poll found\r\n92 per cent of Australians
    favoured measures to combat global warming,\r\nputting them first among the 12
    nations surveyed.\r\n\r\nYet, as social psychologists and marketers know, there
    is no straight\r\nline, and often only a tenuous relationship, between what we
    know and\r\nwhat we do. Staggeringly, few of the efforts designed to mobilise
    action\r\non climate change appear to be underpinned by proper national research\r\non
    public motivation and, subsequent to this, communications framing.\r\nThis is
    the case even where significant money has been poured into\r\npublic information
    campaigns (the UK), and where a government report on\r\nclimate change communications
    strategy cannot be accessed (Australia).\r\nThis is particularly concerning given
    that poorly crafted communications\r\nefforts can have the opposite of the intended
    effect.\r\n\r\nRecent analysis of the apocalyptic headlines and catastrophic images\r\nthat
    constitute the mainstay of much climate communications shows that,\r\nin the majority,
    they provoke feelings of powerlessness rather than a\r\ndesire to act. Fear, guilt,
    anger, defiance, a desire to blame others\r\nand feelings of exhaustion or irritation
    are also among the responses\r\nthe climate change message can provoke when poorly
    framed.\r\n\r\nA more self-critical examination of what might be going wrong with\r\nefforts
    to persuade might also consider the uncomfortable yet potent\r\nobservations made
    by philosopher Sarah Bachelard.\r\n\r\nBachelard, herself an activist, says that
    the sanctimoniousness of some\r\nof her peers can impede successful communication
    and action for change:\r\nâ\x80\x9CThere can be a tone of self-righteousness,
    a kind of shrill moral\r\nindignation, in the speech of those of us who protest
    and campaign â\x80¦ We\r\nknow that we are on the side of the angels, and in our
    own way we can\r\nfail to do justice to the complex reality of most human action
    and\r\nmotivation. We get something out of â\x80\x98being rightâ\x80\x99 â\x80¦
    (and) satisfaction\r\nfrom making those who do not agree with us wrong.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nFinally,
    any effective campaign for change must recognise that reason\r\nhas as little
    hold on key decision makers as it does on the average\r\npunter.\r\n\r\nIn a study
    that revolutionised the field of international relations,\r\npolitical scientist
    Graham Allison demonstrated that government\r\ndecisions are not the result of
    considered choices made by rational\r\nactors but the result of consensus building
    by leaders trying to satisfy\r\na range of political, personal and ideological
    agendas.\r\n\r\nThis implies that whatever the facts or rectitude of the case
    for\r\nchange, government action on the climate issue will be characterised by\r\nincrementalism
    and compromise.\r\n\r\nThe sooner this is recognised, and strategy and tactics
    are geared to\r\naccount for it - something that does not appear to have been
    done by\r\nsome environmental groups, nor by the Australian Greens senators, with\r\nrespect
    to the emissions trading scheme - the more likely advocates will\r\nbe able to
    capitalise on the opportunities for change that do exist.\r\n\r\nA failure of
    communication and tactics, not of understanding may be the\r\ncause of inaction
    on climate change. Until these problems are\r\nacknowledged and tackled, climate
    advocates, however well-meaning, may\r\nbe part of the problem, not the solution."
