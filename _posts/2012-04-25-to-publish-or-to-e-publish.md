  content: "Once upon of time there was a tribe called the Very Smarts. The Very\r\nSmarts
    lived on a island where they planted, tended and then harvested\r\ntrees from
    which they carved beautiful and much-sought after canoes. But\r\nwhile the Very
    Smarts were wonderful craftspeople, they had neither the\r\ninterest nor the acumen
    to distribute or profit from their work.\r\nInstead, completed canoes were rowed
    by the Very Smarts to the\r\nTeleporting tribe on the mainland. There the Teleporters
    would put the\r\nfinal touches on the canoe and, with the Very Smarts help, rate
    each\r\ncanoe for quality.\r\n\r\nOn the teleport home, the Very Smarts took care
    not to lose the\r\nparchment on which evidence of the rating was stamped. A high
    rating\r\nearned the boat builder status and power in the tribe, not to mention\r\nthe
    tastiest morsels and best digs, while a low rating meant disgrace\r\nand despair.
    Once the Very Smarts were gone, the Teleporters got busy.\r\nThe canoes were sold
    to highest bidder for a handsome profit, and then\r\nteleported to their new owners.\r\n\r\nAnd
    so it went, for as long as anyone could remember, until one day the\r\nVery Smarts
    discovered that they could teleport, too. And though it took\r\nawhile, some Very
    Smarts began wondering why they ought to allow the\r\nTeleporters to sell and
    distribute their highly prized canoes, now that\r\nthey could do it themselves.
    But others Very Smarts were less sure. If\r\nthe Teleporters didnâ\x80\x99t rate
    their work, how would they know how to\r\ndistribute social and material resources
    amongst the tribe?\r\n\r\nIf youâ\x80\x99ve been following the feisty debates
    on-line, in the press and in\r\nthe scholarly literature about the impact of the
    internet on publishing,\r\nyouâ\x80\x99ll have no trouble recognising the Teleporters
    as the publishers of\r\nscholarly journals and the dilemma facing the Very Smarts
    as the same\r\none confronting contemporary academics in an electronic age. To
    solve\r\nit, we need to look past the enthusiastic shouting of those championing\r\nan
    open access future, and rapid-fire press releases from publishing\r\nhouses eager
    to assure us theyâ\x80\x99ve finally cracked a viable business\r\nmodel for the
    new age, and return to first principles. Ignoring how\r\nweâ\x80\x99ve always
    done it and why, we need to ask the question: what is it\r\nthat academics need
    from, and are trying to achieve with, scholarly\r\npublishing?\r\n\r\nThe answer
    is relatively simple. Academics need timely and convenient\r\naccess to the most
    up-to-date scholarship in their discipline and their\r\ndisciplineâ\x80\x99s archives.
    They also want their own work published quickly\r\nand disseminated widely, and
    to be credited for their labour in ways\r\nthat enable them to maintain their
    job, or even climb the ladder.\r\n\r\nThe truth, though publishers donâ\x80\x99t
    like to hear it, is that academics\r\nand universities hold most of the cards
    in the scholarly publishing\r\ngame. This is not just because they do the research,
    write the papers\r\nand do the unpaid work required to provide quality assurance
    by\r\nreviewing the work of their peers. It is also because their primary\r\nobjective
    is not to profit from the distribution of their work (like the\r\nVery Smarts,
    most currently earn little to nothing from the hard-copy\r\nand electronic distribution
    of their oeuvres), but to have it read and\r\ncited by others.\r\n\r\nIn the new
    electronic age it is hard to see why the achievement of these\r\ngoals requires
    the input of a professional publisher at all. Sure,\r\npublishers currently edit
    academic papers prior to publication which, in\r\nsome instances, can be intensive
    and painstaking work. But while it has\r\nnot been exploited much to date, the
    expertise to perform this task too\r\nalso exists within the academic tribe, as
    clearly demonstrated by\r\nin-house university journals like Monashâ\x80\x99s
    People and Place.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the only power the electronic shake-out of scholarly\r\ncommunication
    has left to traditional publishers is that of quality\r\ncontrol. In academia,
    publication in journals like Nature and Mind still\r\nopen doors for those seeking
    grants or promotion. This is the Very\r\nSmarts problem: without the stamped parchment
    from the Teleporters, how\r\nwill they compete for rewards?\r\n\r\nBut the truth
    is that new technologies are already showing the way.\r\nInstead of relying on
    the publisherâ\x80\x99s reputation as a quality indicator,\r\nscholars could rely
    on electronic citation counts: an indicator which is\r\nnot currently but can
    be made blind to whether the site of first\r\npublication was an established journal,
    an institutional repository, or\r\nthe authorâ\x80\x99s own website. As well,
    Googleâ\x80\x99s PageRank algorithm is just\r\none of a number of automated methods
    that systematically aggregate the\r\nopinions of unknown individuals that shows
    promise as an indicator of\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nA return to first principles about
    what scholarly publication is all\r\nabout, and what academics need from it, leads
    to the conclusion that in\r\nthe new world of electronic communication the Very
    Smarts donâ\x80\x99t need the\r\nTeleporters any more. What they need are new
    ways of harnessing in-house\r\ntalents to access, disseminate and receive rewards
    for reporting on\r\nquality research results.\r\n\r\n*In 2012, seven years after
