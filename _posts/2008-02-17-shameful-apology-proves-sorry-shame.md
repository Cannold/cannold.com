    House, with members of the Stolen Generations looking on and\r\nthousands more
    bearing witness via video link on the adjacent lawns. One\r\nman, representing
    the nation, validating the painful experiences of\r\nAboriginal Australians and
    by so doing, reminding us of what we as\r\nAustralians have the potential to be.
    The other - his literal shadow -\r\nexcusing, justifying, insisting on his version
    of the truth and in so\r\ndoing, painfully reminding us why progress on race relations
    in this\r\ncountry have been stalled for so long.\r\n\r\nThe trick of oppression
    is to dehumanise the victim. When a dehumanised\r\ngroup is made â\x80\x9Cother,â\x80\x9D
    using, abusing or even killing its members\r\ndoesnâ\x80\x99t seem so wrong. The
    Nazis described Jews as rats and, when\r\ndiscussing the numbers on trains heading
    for Auschwitz, as rags. Even\r\ntoday, Blacks still suffer the occasional insult
    - commonplace in years\r\ngone by - of being likened to animals.\r\n\r\nDehumanisation,
    argues Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela, a former member of South\r\nAfricaâ\x80\x99s Truth
    and Reconciliation Commission, is one of the main causes\r\nof the trauma suffered
    by the oppressed.\r\n\r\nShe illustrates this claim with the story of a black
    South African man\r\nwhose wife was killed by the Pan Africanist Congress while
    they sat\r\nside-by-side in church. â\x80\x9CMy wife was wearing a long blue coat,â\x80\x9D
    the man\r\nsobbed when finally coming face to face with the killers during South\r\nAfricaâ\x80\x99s
    truth and reconciliation process. â\x80\x9CPlease tell me, do you\r\nremember
    shooting my wife?â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThe reality, of course, was that in a church
    of one thousand people,\r\nthere was little chance that the killers remembered
    any one of their\r\nvictims. But for this man, for all victims, it was precisely
    the\r\ninvisibility and interchangeability of their loved one in the eyes of\r\nthe
    perpetrator that hurt so much. Forgiving, and the healing that can\r\ncome after,
    requires the wrong-doers - or those representing them - to\r\nallow their victim
    a face.\r\n\r\nHow is this done? Firstly, victims must be allowed to tell their\r\nstories.
    This allows the trauma to be integrated into the victimâ\x80\x99s life\r\nnarrative
    and prevents her blaming herself or imagining she made the\r\nwhole thing up.
    But listening is not enough. The victim must truly be\r\nheard and trusted. I
    hear you, I believe you, I acknowledge your pain, I\r\nam so sorry what was done
    by me, or in my name. Each of these steps,\r\ntaken when wrong-doers or those
    who represent them listen to their\r\nvictims and reply only with â\x80\x9CIâ\x80\x99m
    sorryâ\x80\x9D give victims back their\r\nhumanity, replacing trauma and the cross-generational
    trail of substance\r\nabuse and social disfunction that flows in its wake with
    the forgiveness\r\nthat is the first step to healing.\r\n\r\nIt was this that
    the Prime Minister stood on Wednesday on the floor of\r\nthe House to offer Aboriginal
    Australians: recognition of their full\r\nhumanity. And it was this humanity that
    his shadow - representing an\r\nopposition that still finds it too much skin off
    their nose to simply\r\nshut up and listen and still insists that their conceptualisation
    of the\r\ncauses of other peopleâ\x80\x99s pain merits centre stage - challenged
    once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nIt is to the credit of Indigenous Australians that they refused
    to let\r\nthe Oppositionâ\x80\x99s emotional tighfistedness and smallness of spirit\r\ndiminish
    or distract from their day. But morally speaking, what Nelson\r\nsaid and did,
    was a shame.\r\n\r\nA sorry, sorry shame."
