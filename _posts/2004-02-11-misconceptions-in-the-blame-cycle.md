    health*\r\n\r\nLast week the Evening Standard reported the findings of a study
    linking\r\n\\\r\nuse of the Pill with infertility. The British study found that
    former\r\nPill users took twice as long to conceive than those who had used\r\ncondoms,
    with those overweight, over thirty-five or with a history of\r\nirregular periods
    most likely to be affected. Nevertheless, less than a\r\nweek later Australian
    experts were hailing the release of a new Pill\r\nthat will allow women to reduce
    their periods to four times a year as\r\nproviding long overdue relief from the
    unnecessary â\x80\x9Cpain and\r\ninconvenienceâ\x80\x9D of a monthly bleed.\r\n\r\nWomen
    are likely to greet these latest findings, and the continued mixed\r\nmessages
    from the medical profession about how best to manage their\r\nreproductive health,
    with the same feelings of confusion and outrage\r\nthat greeted last yearâ\x80\x99s
    belated findings that ingesting combination HRT\r\npills to prevent heart disease
    was not only a waste of time, but a clear\r\nrisk to overall health. Indeed, the
    anger of infertile women upon\r\nlearning this news is likely to be particularly
    keen, as the medical\r\nprofession has been swearing for years that the Pill has
    no negative\r\nimpact on future fertility.\r\n\r\nBut how justified are the explosions
    of female bewilderment and rage\r\nthat follow media reports of new medical information
    and, in their wake,\r\nrevised medical advice? Are medical scientists in general,
    and\r\nprescribing doctors in particular, really to blame for getting it wrong\r\nin
    the first place, or must women also accept some blame for the health\r\nconsequences
    of the drugs they choose to ingest?\r\n\r\nThe truth is somewhere in between.\r\n\r\nOn
    the one hand, there is frighteningly little public discussion of the\r\nimposed
    and necessary limits of the testing procedures all new drugs\r\nmust undergo before
    being approved for use in Australia. Most patients,\r\nfor instance, would be
    shocked to discover that many of the drugs their\r\nGPs prescribe have not been
    properly evaluated, either for safety or\r\neffectiveness, for the condition and/or
    the type of patient for whom\r\nthey are prescribed. For instance, when doctors
    began advising all\r\nmenopausal women to take HRT (rather than the ones with
    acute menopausal\r\nsymptoms originally targeted by the drug) there was no good
    research\r\nthat it would reduce womenâ\x80\x99s risk of heart disease. Thatâ\x80\x99s
    right, you\r\nheard me. Absolutely none.\r\n\r\nBefore doctors prescribe for particular
    patients, they should ensure\r\nthat high quality evidence exists that the drug
    will be both safe and\r\neffective for that particular patient. As respected medical
    journalist\r\nRay Moynihan has pointed out, problems often arise when doctors
    begin\r\nprescribing drugs tested on, say, critically ill middle-aged white men,\r\nto
    patients of all ages and sexes who present with far milder forms of\r\nthe condition.
    In addition, doctors need to pay attention to whether the\r\ntrials have adequately
    large sample sizes, are randomised and controlled\r\n(the gold standard in medical
    research) and independently conducted\r\n(rather than drug-company sponsored).
    Finally, they must be far more\r\nupfront with patients about what isnâ\x80\x99t
    known about a particular drug.\r\nThe impact of ongoing use is a big one here,
    simply because when a drug\r\nis new, or being prescribed for a new condition,
    even if someone has had\r\nthe interest, foresight and financial capacity to study
    its long term\r\neffects, the results wonâ\x80\x99t be known for years.\r\n\r\nWith
    most major medical journals available through on-line prescription,\r\nthere are
    few excuses for doctors not to provide patients with\r\nup-to-the-minute information
    about the drugs they recommend.\r\n\r\nBut women, too, have a role to play in
    getting and staying well. Before\r\nwe swallow anything, particularly over months
    and years, we must ask our\r\ndoctors about what is, and is not, known about their
    risks and benefits\r\nfor a patient like us and what the quality is of the available
    evidence.\r\nAnd, if such answers are not forthcoming, we must pursue them ourselves.\r\nAfter
    all, it is our bodies and lives that will be affected - sometimes\r\ncritically
    and for life - if we fail to act. Mostly, we must assume that\r\nin many instances
    when we swallow pharmaceuticals - especially in the\r\nlong term - we are part
    of a (usually unacknowledged) experiment into\r\ntheir costs and benefits.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    if we kept this in mind, many of us would choose to take fewer\r\npills, and less
    of the ones we do. Instead, we might choose to take only\r\nthose pharmaceuticals

    available."
