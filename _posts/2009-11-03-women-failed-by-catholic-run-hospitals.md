    as\r\nthe service of all the Victorian women. Now, women inquiring about\r\nhaving
    their baby there will be asked their postcode. Should they fall\r\noutside the
    hospitalâ\x80\x99s new geographical catchment area and be at small\r\nrisk of
    complication, theyâ\x80\x99ll be referred to a hospital closer to home.\r\n\r\nPoor
    government policy and planning, an upward blip in the fertility\r\nrate and Victoriaâ\x80\x99s
    burgeoning population has seen births jump 12 per\r\ncent in Victoria over a three
    year period, but the number of maternity\r\nbeds fail to keep pace. As a consequence,
    the Victorian government now\r\nâ\x80\x9Cencouragesâ\x80\x9D women to birth at
    their local, suburban hospital.\r\n\r\nFor most women, the major anxiety generated
    by the squeeze is finding\r\nsomewhere, anywhere, to have their baby. But behind
    the scenes, some\r\nperinatal specialists and GPs who share the care of pregnant
    women with\r\nhospitals are fretting about women being referred away from\r\nnon-sectarian
    public hospitals and towards institutions that are\r\nCatholic-run.\r\n\r\nThe
    reason why is simple. Catholic-run hospitals, even those dedicated\r\nto womenâ\x80\x99s
    health, have a number of services they will not provide. As\r\nthe Most Rev. Anthony
    Fisher explained earlier this year: â\x80\x9CCatholic\r\nhealthcare institutions,
    whatever legal, financial or other pressure\r\nthey are under, may not cooperate
    with abortion, sterilization or\r\neuthanasia.â\x80\x9D In addition, and for religious
    reasons too, Catholic-run\r\nhealthcare institutions donâ\x80\x99t offer a full
    range of contraceptive\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nWhat are the downstream consequences
    of this refusal to â\x80\x9Ccooperateâ\x80\x9D for\r\npatients? Some women discover,
    as they approach a planned caesarian\r\nsection, that they wonâ\x80\x99t be able
    to have their tubes tied at the time of\r\ndelivery, requiring them to undertake
    the cost, inconvenience and risk\r\nof having the procedure done at a later date.
    Others, already reeling\r\nfrom the blow of abnormal results from pre- natal tests
    or screens the\r\nhospital did provide, find they must transfer to another institution
    if\r\nthey make the difficult choice to terminate. Women whose membranes\r\nrupture
    too early may be denied surgery to remove the doomed fetus, and\r\neven intervention
    to speed up the delivery. That is, unless sepsis is\r\ndiagnosed and the womanâ\x80\x99s
    womb or life is at risk. Rape victims brought\r\ninto casualty will not be offered
    emergency contraception. If staff\r\nsuspect pregnancy, the woman will not eve
    be referred to a rape crisis\r\ncentre that does offer the pills.\r\n\r\nDo Victorian
    women know the limits placed on their care when they enter\r\na Catholic-run hospital?
    For many, it seems, the answer is, â\x80\x98no.â\x80\x99 As one\r\nGP put it,
    â\x80\x9CIâ\x80\x99m not sure women ever do fully understand the\r\nimplications.â\x80\x9D
    Currently, there seems no attempt for referring hospitals\r\nto consent women
    with regard to these issues, nor for Catholic-run\r\nhospitals to make specific
    disclosures on such matters when women arrive\r\nfor care. For instance, neither
    the patient information guide, nor the\r\nguidelines for those sharing the care
    of pregnant patients with the\r\nMercy makes any reference to the limits the hospital
    puts on services\r\nbecause of its religious views.\r\n\r\nBoth Catholic-run health
    institutions, and the Governments that fund\r\nthem to provide essential healthcare
    services to Victorian taxpayers,\r\nhave an obligation to ensure that female patients,
    and the external\r\nhealthcare providers sharing care of such patients, are fully
    informed\r\nabout what the hospitalâ\x80\x99s religious philosophy might mean
    for patient\r\ncare. For a hospital to simply say they are Catholic and assume
    that\r\neveryone knows what this means, including very young women, new migrants\r\nto
    Australia and those from non- English-speaking backgrounds, fails the\r\nmost
    basic disclosure requirements necessary for informed consent.\r\n\r\nBut lack
    of consent is just a small corner of the problem. The real\r\nissue is the decision
    by governments to pour public money into\r\ninstitutions unable to offer a full
    range of medical services to half of\r\nthe public. The real problem is government
    policy that allows such\r\ninstitutions to become central to healthcare arrangements
    designed to\r\nserve all citizens despite knowing the limits such institutions
    place on\r\nthe care they provide to women.\r\n\r\nCatholics, and any other faith-based
    minorities in Australia, are\r\nentitled to their moral beliefs and to the expression
    of these through\r\nthe institutions they run. But women citizens and taxpayers
    have a right\r\nto healthcare provision that does not put them at the mercy of
    those\r\nviews, and the healthcare information and options that flow from them.\r\nThere
    seems little problem with Catholic hospitals providing\r\nboutique-care to women
    and men able to make an informed decision about\r\nits suitability to their needs.
    But when women have no choice but to\r\nbecome patients in this system for emergency
    and essential health care,\r\nsomething is terribly wrong.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic
    Church sees the provision of health care as part of its\r\nmission, believing
    that a Catholic-run hospital â\x80\x9Cserves the whole\r\ncommunity, especially
    the vulnerable.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nPregnant women are vulnerable. Rape victims are
    vulnerable. Patients\r\nwithout information and real options about their health
    care are\r\nvulnerable.\r\n\r\nVictorian women pay taxes, and are citizens with
    a right to informed\r\ndecision-making about and access to the full range of sexual
    and\r\nreproductive health services. Not just those the Catholic-run hospital\r\nnearest
    them is willing to provide."
