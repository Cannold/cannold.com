    for Approval of RU86) Bill 2005 may be sliding towards\r\ndefeat in the House
    of Representatives. Designed to undercut 1996\r\namendments to the Therapeutic
    Goods Act that have effectively banned\r\nRU486 and other abortifacient drugs
    from Australia, the Bill - having\r\npassed through the Senate last Thursday -
    is now the subject of an\r\namendment that, if successful, will see the ban remain
    firmly in place.\r\n\r\nThe amendments - one introduced by Queensland Liberal
    Andrew Laming and\r\na another by NSW Liberal Jackie Kelly - are similar to those
    advanced in\r\nthe Senate by Tasmanian Richard Colbeck and the Northern Territoryâ\x80\x99s\r\nNigel
    Scullion. However, unlike the Colbeck/Scullion amendment, which\r\nattracted minimal
    support, some members of the Lower House - those in\r\nmarginal seats or who relied
    on Family First preferences at the last\r\nelection and have swallowed the â\x80\x98we
    will target you at the next\r\nelectionâ\x80\x99 bluster of pro-life lobbyists
    - are now seriously considering\r\nthrowing their support behind the Laming amendment.\r\n\r\nThis
    is a disastrous outcome for those hoping for a quick resolution to\r\nthe divisive
    debate about abortion that has accompanied the introduction\r\nof the Bill. It
    is also a blow to those hoping that the passage of the\r\nunamended Bill would
    mean that the Therapeutic Goods Administration\r\n(TGA) would finally get a chance
    to conduct an impartial and thorough\r\nevaluation of the safety and efficacy
    of the medication and - should\r\nthey give the go ahead - approve the registration
    of the drug in\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nSuccessful amendment of the Bill in the Lower
    House could mean\r\nAustralians are in for â\x80\x98the abortion debate that time
    forgot.â\x80\x99 Indeed,\r\nthis may be the intention of the amendment. A fax
    sent to all MPs urges\r\nthem to vote for the amendment to ensure an â\x80\x98all-encompassing
    debateâ\x80\x99 on\r\nthe â\x80\x98moral and ethicalâ\x80\x99 - as well as the
    â\x80\x98safetyâ\x80\x99 - issues is had this\r\ntime, and every time, the TGA
    approves such drugs.\r\n\r\nMPs who vote for the current amendments will condemn
    the rest of us to\r\nweeks, if not months, of further discussion on RU486 because
    the amended\r\nBill must return to the Senate for consideration and a vote. If
    the\r\nSenate refuses to accept the amended Bill, the House of Representatives\r\ncan
    either insist on their amendment or vote to pass the original. If\r\nthey go the
    former route then the Bill will return to the Senate which\r\ncan either vote
    to accept the amended one or return the original to the\r\nHouse of Represenatatives
    â\x80¦ and on and on it goes.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the Bill can become a football, passing
    back and forth between\r\nthe two Houses until - unable to reach agreement - both
    agree to set it\r\naside, meaning that the current untenable situation, where
    the Health\r\nMinister decides on drugs like RU486, prevails.\r\n\r\nThere are
    both principled and practical problems with the Laming\r\namendment. While it
    allows the TGA to evaluate the drug without prior\r\napproval of the Minister
    - the Parliament would have the power to\r\noverride the TGAâ\x80\x99s decision
    to register the drug. This replicates -\r\nindeed multiplies - the current problem
    of non-experts making critical\r\ndecisions based on heaven-knows-what information
    about life-altering and\r\nlife-saving medications.\r\n\r\nLiberal MP Danna Valeâ\x80\x99s
    plea to her colleagues to vote against the\r\ncurrent Bill because the drugâ\x80\x99s
    availability could lead to Australia\r\nbeing dominated by Muslims - a claim not
    only replete with racist\r\novertones but also based on the false assertion that
    making RU486\r\navailable will increase the abortion rate - offers an insight
    into the\r\nsort of â\x80\x98logicâ\x80\x99 that some MPs might apply to decisions
    about drugs like\r\nRU486 if given the chance by passing of the amendment.\r\n\r\nThis
    principled problem leads to the practical problem already facing\r\nwomen and
    patients desperately seeking access to the drug: no\r\npharmaceutical company
    is willing to go through the expensive and\r\ntime-consuming process of seeking
    TGA registration for RU486, despite\r\nreams of high-quality evidence that it
    is both safe and effective. This\r\nis because of the uncertainty created by the
    current arrangements, which\r\nallow the Minister to veto the TGAâ\x80\x99s ruling.\r\n\r\nThe
    Laming amendment multiplies this uncertainty by allowing the TGAâ\x80\x99s\r\nevidence-based
    decision to be overturned by Parliament and in so doing,\r\nvirtually assures
    a continued absence of applications by drug companies\r\nto register and market
    the drug in Australia.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if the amendment passes, this could be the
    situation not just\r\nfor abortifacient drugs but for all drugs a small, vociferous
    minority\r\ndeems controversial. The pro-amendment fax states:\r\n\r\nRU486 is
    just the first of many highly controversial drugs which the TGA\r\nwill confront
    over the next decade â\x80¦ The TGA Act 1989 should be amended\r\nto ensure that
    any controversial drug is not listed in Australia purely\r\nbecause it is safe
    and effective.\r\n\r\nDrug approval by popular opinion, it seems, is just around
    the corner.\r\n\r\nSo close, yet so far. It is the face of Mary Lander - the Australian\r\nwoman
    diagnosed around this time last year with an inoperable brain\r\ntumour who is
    still struggling to import RU486 to treat her condition -\r\nthat swims before
    my eyes as I consider the possibility that having\r\npassed the Senate with such
    overwhelming support, this Bill may still be\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\nMaryâ\x80\x99s
    face, and faces of the Australian women who - having made the\r\ndifficult decision
    to terminate - are so determined to carry out this\r\ndecision without undergoing
    surgery and without delay (medical abortion\r\nusing RU486 can be done earlier
    than surgical abortion) that they hop on\r\na plane to New Zealand or the UK to
    gain access to the drug.\r\n\r\nMPs considering the Laming amendment should not
    kid themselves that it\r\nrepresents a reasonable compromise position. In fact,
    the amendments\r\nundermine the fundamental intention of the Bill, which is to
    remove\r\nmedical and scientific decisions from the hands of politicians, and\r\nplace
    them in the hands of the experts at the TGA.\r\n\r\nYes, RU486 procures early
    non-surgical abortion, but it also has the\r\ncapacity to save the lives of countless
    Australians suffering from\r\nserious diseases. And insofar as MPs believe decisions
    relating to\r\nabortion needs to be regulated by politicians, they can rest assured\r\nthat
    they are. Every State in Australia has criminal or medical\r\nregulations overseeing
    abortion and State MPs, like their Federal\r\ncounterparts, come up for regular
    re-election, too. It has been argued\r\nmore than once that, given the availability
    of legal abortion in\r\nAustralia, the push by Federal parliamentarians to constrain
    the\r\nlegitimate role of the TGA is illegitimately interfering with State laws\r\nand
    policies.\r\n\r\nSupporting the Laming amendment means affirming the dubious principle\r\nthat
    politicians, rather than medical and scientific experts, are the\r\nright people
    to make critical decisions about one particular class of\r\ndrugs. In practice,
    it means denying Australian women with an unplanned\r\nand unwanted pregnancy
    - and other Australian patients with\r\nlife-threatening tumours and cancers -
    ready and affordable access to a\r\npharmaceutical that is used safely and legally
    by millions of patients\r\naround the globe each year.\r\n\r\nPoliticians have
    been afforded a conscience vote on this issue. They\r\nhave a moral obligation
    to use it to ensure women, in consultation with\r\ntheir doctors, get one too."
