  content: "A few months back I was a guest on a morning talk show. â\x80\x9CDr Cannold,â\x80\x9D\r\none
    of the hosts asked, â\x80\x9CWhy is it that older women often donâ\x80\x99t support\r\nyounger
    ones?â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nI cleared my throat but was cut short. We were out of time.
    Later,\r\nhowever, my inbox and Twitter feed confirmed what I already knew. Women\r\nare
    desperately interested in the answer to this question and a related\r\none, â\x80\x9CWhy
    do women join anti-women causes?â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nHere are my thoughts.\r\n\r\nOlder
    women can be nasty to younger women because theyâ\x80\x99re jealous. Youth\r\nequates
    to fertility and sometimes to beauty. In a manâ\x80\x99s world both\r\nconfer
    power. Never mind that younger women may be unaware of this power\r\nor unwilling
    to use it (often and ironically because they have listened\r\nwhen their female
    elders advised against it). The bald facts are that\r\nyounger women have power
    that the uncompromising gavel of time has\r\npronounced inaccessible to older
    women. In a world that limits womenâ\x80\x99s\r\naccess to other routes of influence
    over their own destiny, this loss\r\nhurts.\r\n\r\nOlder women can be less willing
    mentors than older men. Take a look\r\naround and the reasons for this become
    clear. To give those scrambling\r\nup behind you a helping hand, you need to be
    well ahead of them and have\r\na firm grip. But the higher up you go in the media,
    government,\r\nentertainment or corporate worlds, the fewer women youâ\x80\x99ll
    find. In 2010,\r\nfor example, 2.5 per cent of ASX 200 chairmen and 3 per cent
    of chief\r\nexecutives were women. Just 30 per cent of parliamentarians are female\r\nand
    far fewer of these have safe seats or ministerial posts.\r\n\r\nSome women who
    have managed to scrape their way to the top donâ\x80\x99t feel\r\nsecure enough
    for generosity. Theyâ\x80\x99ve done the sums and, in contrast to\r\ntheir male
    counterparts, they know theyâ\x80\x99re competing with junior women\r\nfor the
    scarce, even token, spots allocated for females.\r\n\r\nThe generation gap is
    not the only one that divides women. What about\r\nwomen-led social movements
    with anti-women agendas? Whether itâ\x80\x99s\r\nfundamentalist religious movements
    striving to return pregnant and\r\neconomically dependent women to the home, or
    political parties dedicated\r\nto cutting funding to child care and food aid for
    the children of the\r\nmostly female poor, women can be well-represented among
    those driving\r\nand supporting laws that deny their own sex autonomy and dignity.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    they are in denial. To work towards advancing the interests of\r\nher sex, a woman
    must admit that sexism exists and is crimping her own\r\nlife chances. Some women
    are loath to do this, especially when the only\r\nsensible corrective is to steal
    time from the pursuit of her personal\r\nambitions to assume the gargantuan task
    of changing the world.\r\n\r\nWhile not admirable, I can understand the woman
    who wishes so hard that\r\nshe had the freedom to simply get on with living her
    life in the same\r\nway she can see her male siblings and friends doing that she
    convinces\r\nherself that she does.\r\n\r\nAs a repentant young woman recently
    explained of her former pro-life\r\nstance, â\x80\x9CBecause I was saving myself
    for marriage . . . I knew that I\r\nwould . . . never be a murderer like those
    sluts.â\x80\x9D Insisting one is\r\ndifferent, special and more virtuous than
    other women - and so not in\r\nneed of the social salves they seek - is the act
    of a fragile ego. But\r\nit also speaks poignant volumes about the yearning all
    humans have to\r\nduck obstacles of bias and discrimination and gain a respected
    place in\r\nsociety on their own steam."
