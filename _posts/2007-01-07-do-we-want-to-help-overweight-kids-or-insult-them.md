    been ineffective in\r\nreducing our childrenâ\x80\x99s collective girth, but also

    knows\r\nthat â\x80\x9Cfatâ\x80\x9D is more than a physical description of body
    mass, but a\r\nnegative assessment of physical attractiveness and moral worth.
    Despite\r\nprotests outside the White House by overweight Americans holding\r\nplacards
    insisting that â\x80\x9Cfat is not a four letter wordâ\x80\x9D, children today\r\nare
    well aware of the connection in the popular mind between the\r\ngenerously waisted
    and the indiscreet, the lazy, the pitiful, the\r\nasexual and the wildly out of
    control. Cultural researchers say it is no\r\ncoincidence that in times of sexual
    permissiveness and consumerist\r\nplenty, thinness is idealized for representing
    virtue, self-denial and\r\nself-control.\r\n\r\nChildrenâ\x80\x99s bodies change
    rapidly right up to their early twenties, with\r\nthe pre-teen and teen years
    critical moments for the development of\r\nself-identity and self-esteem. Itâ\x80\x99s
    hard to imagine a worse time for\r\nchildren to be told their developing bodies
    are an eyesore and evidence\r\nof poor moral character.\r\n\r\nJust as damning
    is the inevitable failure of any behavioural change\r\napproach obsessed with
    cataloguing and stamping out fat. Behavioural\r\nchange relies on our feeling
    good about ourselves, something just as\r\ntrue for children as for adults. The
    higher the temperature surrounding\r\nthe moral panic about our childrenâ\x80\x99s
    expanding girth, the worse\r\noverweight children are likely to feel about themselves,
    and the less\r\nlikely they are to feel worthy of their own efforts to change.\r\n\r\nThis
    counterproductive behavioural circularity that begins with low\r\nself-esteem
    is familiar to addiction counsellors, and is no less evident\r\n- should we care
    to listen - in the testimony of the overweight. â\x80\x9CYou\r\nget in a vicious
    circle about losing weight,â\x80\x9D Diane Oâ\x80\x99Mara told the Age\r\nearlier
    this year. â\x80\x9CYou eat the wrong thing, then you feel bad, then you\r\neat
    more.â\x80\x9D The nexus between harsh social judgments of the obese, their\r\nlow
    self-esteem and consequent inability to lose weight is summed up by\r\nAmerican
    professor and author Peter Stearns. â\x80\x9CIf you fail to lose weight\r\nyou
    are demonstrating youâ\x80\x99re a bad person. Itâ\x80\x99s a big burden. Faced
    with\r\nthis additional pressure you are even more likely to say \\`The hell with\r\nit!
    Iâ\x80\x99m going to get ice cream. I am such a bad person I need to solace\r\nmyself.â\x80\x99â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nOf
    course, the poor correlation between negative self esteem and\r\nsuccessful weight
    loss serves the diet industry well. Studies suggest\r\nthat only when consumers
    hate their overweight bodies, and believe them\r\nunattractive, are they motivated
    to dig deep for the diet products and\r\nservices worth more than 500 million
    a year in Australia. As well, the\r\nnow accepted paradox that dieting makes you
    fat ensures that the vast\r\nmajority of consumers will â\x80\x9Cfailâ\x80\x9D
    and - dragging their bedraggled\r\nself-esteem behind them - return for second
    and third helpings of\r\nexpensive but ineffective â\x80\x9Ctherapyâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nBut
    if insults are counter-productive and hand wringing is out, what\r\nshould we
    be doing? In general terms, we need to stop talking about the\r\ndepravity of
    fat, and focus instead on the desirability of good health.\r\nFocusing on obesity
    inevitably leads to â\x80\x9Cdonâ\x80\x99tâ\x80\x9D and â\x80\x9Cshouldnâ\x80\x99tâ\x80\x9D
    messages\r\nthat problematically posit guilt and counterproductively idealise\r\npenitent
    self-denial. In contrast, promoting good health lends itself to\r\nmessages of
    â\x80\x9Cdoâ\x80\x9D (eat healthy foods) and â\x80\x9Cdesertâ\x80\x9D (as in,
    you deserve\r\nit) that connect self-nurture with the bodily well-being necessary
    to\r\nenjoy the good things in life.\r\n\r\nPositive messages are also more likely
    to be effective in promoting\r\nbehavioural change, and insofar as they focus
    more on the importance of\r\nstaying active rather than on what we eat, may even
    be more consistent\r\nwith the medical evidence. Paul Campos, Professor of law
    at the\r\nUniversity of Colorado and author of The Obesity Myth argues that\r\nactivity
    is a better predictor of health than weight and that â\x80\x9CThere is\r\nno good
    evidence that significant long-term weight loss is beneficial to\r\nhealthâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nWe
    need to speak to our children, and about them, in ways that make our\r\nlove for
    them, and approval of the people they are becoming, crystal\r\nclear. Teaching
    them how to nurture themselves by eating healthy food\r\nand participating in
    physical activity they enjoy is the most ethical\r\nand effective way for us as
    parents, and as a society, to offer them the\r\ngift of good health."
