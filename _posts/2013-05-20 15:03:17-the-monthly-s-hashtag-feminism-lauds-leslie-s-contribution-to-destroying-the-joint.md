  content: "by Robyn Annear\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CDo you want to know how God turns a man
    into a feminist?â\x80\x9D asked Margie Abbott, addressing a business gathering
    in Penrith (the God-struck man in question being her husband, the federal Opposition
    leader). â\x80\x9CHe gives him three daughters.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nI donâ\x80\x99t
    believe it. My father dismissed women as sluts, nags, idiots and upstarts â\x80\x93
    all except me, whom he loved to the stars. How can it be that a man feels no contradiction
    between the rancour he bears women in general (and uppity women in particular)
    and a wish for his own daughter to have every opportunity? All I know is that
    the siring of daughters is no inoculation against misogyny.\r\n\r\nMisogyny exerts
    a force on all our lives: girls to women, boys to men. Whether we mark it or not,
    it marks us. Yet unlike its vassal, sexism, only rarely is misogyny called out.
    Before Julia Gillardâ\x80\x99s spray in parliament last October, the word itself
    had long been relegated to the language of extremism: only a tabloid â\x80\x9Cman-haterâ\x80\x9D
    would talk of woman-hating. Since Gillard spoke its name, misogyny â\x80\x93 the
    word and its meaning â\x80\x93 has been drawn from the shadow into the light,
    from the margin to the mainstream.\r\n\r\nPolitics, like talkback radio, brings
    out the worst in people. The context of Gillardâ\x80\x99s misogyny speech â\x80\x93
    she was opposing a motion to sack the speaker, Peter Slipper, for vile, sexist
    utterances â\x80\x93 gave credence to those who would dismiss it as a diversion,
    if not outright hypocrisy. Her recent chumminess with shock-jock Kyle Sandilands,
    as brazen a misogynist as ever donned a rabbit suit, deepened the impression that
    Gillardâ\x80\x99s reproach of Tony Abbott had more to do with expediency than
    conviction. Angela Shanahan crowed in the Australian that, with an election in
    the offing, Gillard was showing her true colours, spurning â\x80\x9Cthe sort of
    people who tweet to the ABCâ\x80\x99s Q&Aâ\x80\x9D in favour of the crucial young,
    blue-collar demographic that tunes in to Kyle and Jackie O on Sydney radio. Shanahan
    wrote:\r\n\r\nEven though they loom large in their own estimation, the support
    of bloggers and trolls and twits and other assorted virtual viragos is not enough.
    Real people are really not online 24/7 â\x80¦ Nobody in the real world thought
    misogyny was important. And no one thought it was real.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nChief
    among the â\x80\x9Cvirtual viragosâ\x80\x9D whose realness Shanahan called into
    question are the women (â\x80\x9Ca handful of tens of thousandsâ\x80\x9D) behind
    Destroy the Joint, an online movement targeting misogyny and sexism. The movement
    began as a Twitter hashtag on the last day of August 2012 in response to an incendiary
    remark lobbed by Alan Jones on his radio show that morning: â\x80\x9CWomen are
    destroying the joint â\x80¦â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nSome context. Jones was talking on
    air with Nationals Senator Barnaby Joyce, their ostensible topic the threatened
    sale of Cubbie Station, a massive irrigation property in Joyceâ\x80\x99s south-west
    Queensland electorate, to a majority Chinese-owned buyer. Joyce proposed instead
    that the government buy Cubbie Station, â\x80\x9Csplit it up into small places,
    sell the farms back to Australian farmers and keep a bit of water for the environment
    and everyoneâ\x80\x99s happyâ\x80\x9D. At which point Jones pointed to an initiative
    announced a couple of days earlier by Prime Minister Gillard at the Pacific Islands
    Forum. â\x80\x9CSheâ\x80\x99s promised $320 million to promote â\x80\x98gender
    equalityâ\x80\x99 in the Pacific region.â\x80\x9D The two men shared a laugh,
    and Jones went on:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFair dinkum, mate. This is borrowed money â\x80\x93
    $320 million to increase the number of Pacific women in leadership and decision-making
    roles, to increase womenâ\x80\x99s access to financial services and markets, to
    improve the safety of women through better violence prevention. She [the prime
    minister] said, â\x80\x9CWe know that societies only reach their full potential
    if women are politically participating.â\x80\x9D Women are destroying the joint
    â\x80\x93 Christine Nixon in Melbourne, Clover Moore here. Honestly.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGetting
    wind of Jonesâ\x80\x99s remark later that day, writer and commentator Jane Caro
    tweeted:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGot time on my hands tonight so thought Iâ\x80\x99d spend
    it coming up with new ways of â\x80\x9Cdestroying the jointâ\x80\x9D being a woman
    & all. Ideas welcome.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCaroâ\x80\x99s tweet sparked the #destroythejoint
    Twitter conversation and, two days later, a Destroy the Joint Facebook page. Thousands
    enlarged the conversation by tweeting and retweeting,â\x80\x89â\x80\x9Clikeâ\x80\x9D-ing,
    sharing and commenting. But the movement really took off a month later, after
    Jones told a gathering of Young Liberals that Gillardâ\x80\x99s recently deceased
    father had died of shame. In protest, Destroy the Joint supporters (along with
    the Sack Alan Jones movement) mobilised to put pressure on Jonesâ\x80\x99s advertisers
    to withdraw their sponsorship of his program. And it worked. Mercedes even took
    his car away.\r\n\r\nMonths later, Destroy the Joint is still going strong, with
    tens of thousands of followers and a broader reach across social media (â\x80\x9CFriends
    of Fansâ\x80\x9D) amounting to millions. Every day it carries posts calling out,
    and calling for action against, sexism and misogyny worldwide â\x80\x93 from John
    Lawsâ\x80\x99s despicable questioning of a 14-year-old rape victim, to the gang
    rape and killing of Indian student Jyoti Singh Pandey, to Telstraâ\x80\x99s insistence
    on payment for providing a silent phone number to a woman taking refuge from a
    violent partner.\r\n\r\nNow Jane Caro has edited Destroying the Joint: Why women
    have to change the world (UQP; $29.95), a collection of writing by Australian
    women, which brings the spirit of #destroythejoint into what Angela Shanahan might
    call the real world. Contributor Jennifer Mills writes that â\x80\x9Csocial media
    is us, in all our multiplicity of concerns, perspectives, agendas, obsessions
    and flawsâ\x80\x9D, which also serves as a fair description of the book that has
    grown out of the online movement.\r\n\r\nThe 27 contributions that make up Destroying
    the Joint range across essays, analysis and commentary to memoir, fiction, humour
    and invective. The collection has its share of flakiness, cheap shots, box-ticking
    and score-settling, for assembling a collection of this kind is always a dicey
    undertaking. The compilers approach potential contributors and, faced with short
    lead-times, have pretty much to be content with what they get. The fiction contributions
    to Destroying the Joint are especially ham-fisted. But among the rest there are
    standouts.\r\n\r\nLeslie Cannold explains the significance of what feminist Dale
    Spender calls the â\x80\x9Cone-third ruleâ\x80\x9D: â\x80\x9CThirty per cent is
    the point of critical minority and therefore critical change.â\x80\x9D When womenâ\x80\x99s
    participation â\x80\x93 in the workplace, media, parliament, wherever â\x80\x93
    hits 30%, they become visible. In many fields of Australian society, thatâ\x80\x99s
    where we are now. At the same time as womenâ\x80\x99s visibility makes them count
    in ways they havenâ\x80\x99t up till now â\x80\x93 as role models, mentors, and
    agents of influence and change â\x80\x93 it also makes them targets in a way they
    havenâ\x80\x99t been before. The 30% mark is not in itself a destination, writes
    Cannold, but â\x80\x9Ccan serve as an effective staging post from which equality-minded
    citizens can consolidate and gather forces for the final assault on the male citadel
    and a true and total sharing of powerâ\x80\x9D â\x80\x93 for joint-destroying,
    in other words.\r\n\r\nCarmen Lawrence broadens the brief to point out that we
    are all destroying the joint, our planet. She reminds us about prescient women
    like Rachel Carson and Judith Wright who sounded the alarm about humankindâ\x80\x99s
    despoliation and exploitation of the natural environment. But she over-elaborates,
    so that the readerâ\x80\x99s solidarity wears thin long before the essay ends.
    (Although itâ\x80\x99s not the longest in the book, it feels like it.)\r\n\r\nEmily
    Maguire also brings a welcome wider perspective to the joint-destroying enterprise
    by presenting examples of womenâ\x80\x99s leadership and activism in the developing
    world, in illustration of the point made by the prime minister (and quoted by
    Alan Jones) â\x80\x9Cthat societies only reach their full potential if women are
    politically participatingâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nThe most thoughtful and wise piece
    in the collection is Senator Penny Wongâ\x80\x99s. Reflecting on reactions to
    Gillardâ\x80\x99s misogyny speech, she quotes Susie Oâ\x80\x99Brien of Melbourneâ\x80\x99s
    Herald Sun: â\x80\x9CWhile men wondered what all the fuss was about, many women
    around the nation cheered.â\x80\x9D Wong goes on:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPerhaps the
    men, and some women, who made it clear that they didnâ\x80\x99t understand â\x80\x9Cwhat
    the fuss was aboutâ\x80\x9D had not experienced or observed the sort of behaviour
    the prime ministerâ\x80\x99s speech spoke to. Or, if they had witnessed sexism
    and misogyny, it did not carry the same emotional weight for them. This serves
    as a reminder of the divergent realities that co-exist within our community, that
    we still often cannot see how different things are for others.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWongâ\x80\x99s
    acknowledgement of â\x80\x9Cdivergent realitiesâ\x80\x9D stands out as the only
    bridge this collection offers between the Destroy the Joint ethosphere and other
    points of view.\r\n\r\nAnd hereâ\x80\x99s the thing: until I picked up this book
    Iâ\x80\x99d never heard of the Destroy the Joint movement. Yet the assumption
    of this collection, reiterated throughout, is that Destroy the Joint has really
    shaken things up and that everyone is talking about it. Well, in the world I inhabit
    (not the same â\x80\x9Creal worldâ\x80\x9D as Angela Shanahanâ\x80\x99s; a different
    one) nobodyâ\x80\x99s talking about it. Mention of Destroy the Joint rouses, at
    most, a vague pulse of recognition: â\x80\x9CDoes it have something to do with
    Alan Jones?â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nMany of the contributions to this book highlight,
    for me, the insularity of hashtag activism: social media as echo chamber. Jennifer
    Mills recalls how she learnt of Jonesâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9CWomen are destroying
    the jointâ\x80\x9D remark:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLike most of my news these days, it
    came filtered through Twitter, and I guessed what had happened, triangulating
    it from the various reactions of people and organisations to whom I choose to
    listen â\x80¦\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CTo whom I choose to listen.â\x80\x9D Whatâ\x80\x99s
    new in that? A listener to Alan Jonesâ\x80\x99s breakfast program might use the
    same words to describe how she finds out whatâ\x80\x99s happening in the world.
    As might a person who relies on a chat at the greengrocerâ\x80\x99s to glean the
    local goings-on. But as, increasingly, we submit to being profiled, to having
    our online experience refined and â\x80\x9Ctailoredâ\x80\x9D, our exposure to
    what the illusory worldwide web â\x80\x93 to what the world, in fact â\x80\x93
    has to offer grows ever narrower. Even at the greengrocerâ\x80\x99s thereâ\x80\x99s
    a chance of exposure to views different from your own; but the more time you spend
    online, the more you see only views you agree with.\r\n\r\nExcept for the abuse.
    In staging an online campaign against sexism and misogyny, Destroy the Joint activists
    have found themselves swimming in shark-infested waters. Daily they are subjected
    to forcible reminders of their mission: â\x80\x9Csmears, threats of violence and
    online flaming attacksâ\x80\x9D. These days, any woman who takes a stance or expresses
    a strong opinion knows about the â\x80\x9Cnut jobsâ\x80\x9D (Julia Gillardâ\x80\x99s
    term for them) online, the internetâ\x80\x99s anonymity allowing for â\x80\x93
    encouraging? â\x80\x93 the unchecked venting of misogyny, along with all the other
    lurking hatreds.\r\n\r\nSo, as an online campaigner, the risk is that your world
    will be peopled by those who agree with you and those who hate you. Us and them.
    That doesnâ\x80\x99t amount to a multiplicity of viewpoints or make for a nuanced
    consideration of â\x80\x9Cdivergent realitiesâ\x80\x9D. What it does amount to,
    for the likes of Alan Jones, is a recipe for success.\r\n\r\nWhen Destroy the
    Joint went after him, Jones lost a few advertisers for a while, but he kept his
    program â\x80\x93 and his audience of roughly half a million listeners each week.
    Players like Jones, Laws and Sandilands know that itâ\x80\x99s just as important
    to have people hate them as love them. What is poison to their brand is indifference.
    So theyâ\x80\x99re always pushing the edges of taste and behaviour, sometimes
    overstepping the bounds. Then comes the outcry, the slap on the wrist, the half-apology
    â\x80\x93 and the fans love it. According to brand expert Dan Bradley, writing
    in Radio Today, the only reason Alan Jones will ever be sacked is if his ratings
    become uncompetitive.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n[T]he paradox of orchestrated social media
    campaigns, driven by people who are generally not listeners to either show, is
    that when they attack Jones or Sandilands, they are reinforcing the passion that
    the core fans feel for the show and for the personality.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSo, another
    echo chamber: one in which, following Prime Minister Gillardâ\x80\x99s misogyny
    speech, it would have been perfectly possible to wonder â\x80\x9Cwhat the fuss
    was aboutâ\x80\x9D. Is this â\x80\x93 Jonesworld â\x80\x93 the â\x80\x9Creal worldâ\x80\x9D
    of which the Australianâ\x80\x99s Angela Shanahan writes, in which nobody thinks
    misogyny is important, or even real? Could it be Jonesâ\x80\x99s western Sydney
    heartland that Shanahan is picturing when she writes of feminismâ\x80\x99s irrelevance
    to â\x80\x9Cwomen living in the rich, comfortable West in perfect equality with
    menâ\x80\x9D?\r\n\r\nPerfect equality. Perfect. Equality. I could stare at those
    words all day and still fail to see how they fit together in the context of women
    and men. But they remind me of something. When Alan Jones prefaced his â\x80\x9Cdestroying
    the jointâ\x80\x9D remark with a quote from Julia Gillardâ\x80\x99s Rarotonga
    speech (or, more likely, from the Australianâ\x80\x99s report of it), he omitted
    two key words. What Gillard said was: â\x80\x9CWe know that societies only reach
    their full potential if women are politically participating as equals.â\x80\x9D
    Two words too many for Mr Jones.\r\n\r\nThe birth of the Destroy the Joint movement
    pre-dated by about seven weeks the prime ministerâ\x80\x99s misogyny speech. Itâ\x80\x99s
    not outlandish to imagine that the movementâ\x80\x99s existence, the conversation
    it had started, may have strengthened her hand. Whatever you think of Gillardâ\x80\x99s
    speech â\x80\x93 of its motives and sincerity â\x80\x93 it will stand as a landmark:
    the breaking of a taboo, a marker of change.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CProgressives,â\x80\x9D
    writes Penny Wong in Destroying the Joint, â\x80\x9Care always on the lookout
    for signs of change â\x80¦ The hashtag destroyingthejoint signalled enough â\x80¦
    an underlying frustration with our societyâ\x80\x99s dominant voice that erupted
    in an online roar of â\x80\x98You donâ\x80\x99t speak for me!â\x80\x99â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\n*Robyn

    At the same time as womenâ\x80\x99s visibility makes them count in ways they havenâ\x80\x99t
    up till now â\x80\x93 as role models, mentors, and agents of influence and change
    â\x80\x93 it also makes them targets in a way they havenâ\x80\x99t been before.
    The 30% mark is not in itself a destination, writes Cannold, but â\x80\x9Ccan
    serve as an effective staging post from which equality-minded citizens can consolidate
    and gather forces for the final assault on the male citadel and a true and total
    sharing of powerâ\x80\x9D â\x80\x93 for joint-destroying, in other words.</p>\n\n<p>Carmen
    Lawrence broadens the brief to point out that we are all destroying the joint,
    our planet. She reminds us about prescient women like Rachel Carson and Judith
    Wright who sounded the alarm about humankindâ\x80\x99s despoliation and exploitation
    of the natural environment. But she over-elaborates, so that the readerâ\x80\x99s
    solidarity wears thin long before the essay ends. (Although itâ\x80\x99s not the
    longest in the book, it feels like it.)</p>\n\n<p>Emily Maguire also brings a
    welcome wider perspective to the joint-destroying enterprise by presenting examples
    of womenâ\x80\x99s leadership and activism in the developing world, in illustration
    of the point made by the prime minister (and quoted by Alan Jones) â\x80\x9Cthat
    societies only reach their full potential if women are politically participatingâ\x80\x9D.</p>\n\n<p>The
    most thoughtful and wise piece in the collection is Senator Penny Wongâ\x80\x99s.
    Reflecting on reactions to Gillardâ\x80\x99s misogyny speech, she quotes Susie
    Oâ\x80\x99Brien of Melbourneâ\x80\x99s Herald Sun: â\x80\x9CWhile men wondered
    what all the fuss was about, many women around the nation cheered.â\x80\x9D Wong
    goes on:</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the men, and some women, who made it clear that they
    didnâ\x80\x99t understand â\x80\x9Cwhat the fuss was aboutâ\x80\x9D had not experienced
    or observed the sort of behaviour the prime ministerâ\x80\x99s speech spoke to.
    Or, if they had witnessed sexism and misogyny, it did not carry the same emotional
    weight for them. This serves as a reminder of the divergent realities that co-exist
    within our community, that we still often cannot see how different things are
    for others.</p>\n\n<p>Wongâ\x80\x99s acknowledgement of â\x80\x9Cdivergent realitiesâ\x80\x9D
    stands out as the only bridge this collection offers between the Destroy the Joint
    ethosphere and other points of view.</p>\n\n<p>And hereâ\x80\x99s the thing: until
    I picked up this book Iâ\x80\x99d never heard of the Destroy the Joint movement.
    Yet the assumption of this collection, reiterated throughout, is that Destroy
    the Joint has really shaken things up and that everyone is talking about it. Well,
    in the world I inhabit (not the same â\x80\x9Creal worldâ\x80\x9D as Angela Shanahanâ\x80\x99s;
    a different one) nobodyâ\x80\x99s talking about it. Mention of Destroy the Joint
    rouses, at most, a vague pulse of recognition: â\x80\x9CDoes it have something
    to do with Alan Jones?â\x80\x9D</p>\n\n<p>Many of the contributions to this book
    highlight, for me, the insularity of hashtag activism: social media as echo chamber.
    Jennifer Mills recalls how she learnt of Jonesâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9CWomen are destroying
    the jointâ\x80\x9D remark:</p>\n\n<p>Like most of my news these days, it came
    filtered through Twitter, and I guessed what had happened, triangulating it from
    the various reactions of people and organisations to whom I choose to listen â\x80¦</p>\n\n<p>â\x80\x9CTo
    whom I choose to listen.â\x80\x9D Whatâ\x80\x99s new in that? A listener to Alan
    Jonesâ\x80\x99s breakfast program might use the same words to describe how she
    finds out whatâ\x80\x99s happening in the world. As might a person who relies
    on a chat at the greengrocerâ\x80\x99s to glean the local goings-on. But as, increasingly,
    we submit to being profiled, to having our online experience refined and â\x80\x9Ctailoredâ\x80\x9D,
    our exposure to what the illusory worldwide web â\x80\x93 to what the world, in
    fact â\x80\x93 has to offer grows ever narrower. Even at the greengrocerâ\x80\x99s
    thereâ\x80\x99s a chance of exposure to views different from your own; but the
    more time you spend online, the more you see only views you agree with.</p>\n\n<p>Except
    for the abuse. In staging an online campaign against sexism and misogyny, Destroy
    the Joint activists have found themselves swimming in shark-infested waters. Daily
    they are subjected to forcible reminders of their mission: â\x80\x9Csmears, threats
    of violence and online flaming attacksâ\x80\x9D. These days, any woman who takes
    a stance or expresses a strong opinion knows about the â\x80\x9Cnut jobsâ\x80\x9D
    (Julia Gillardâ\x80\x99s term for them) online, the internetâ\x80\x99s anonymity
    allowing for â\x80\x93 encouraging? â\x80\x93 the unchecked venting of misogyny,
    along with all the other lurking hatreds.</p>\n\n<p>So, as an online campaigner,
    the risk is that your world will be peopled by those who agree with you and those
    who hate you. Us and them. That doesnâ\x80\x99t amount to a multiplicity of viewpoints
    or make for a nuanced consideration of â\x80\x9Cdivergent realitiesâ\x80\x9D.
    What it does amount to, for the likes of Alan Jones, is a recipe for success.</p>\n\n<p>When
    Destroy the Joint went after him, Jones lost a few advertisers for a while, but
    he kept his program â\x80\x93 and his audience of roughly half a million listeners
    each week. Players like Jones, Laws and Sandilands know that itâ\x80\x99s just
    as important to have people hate them as love them. What is poison to their brand
    is indifference. So theyâ\x80\x99re always pushing the edges of taste and behaviour,
    sometimes overstepping the bounds. Then comes the outcry, the slap on the wrist,
    the half-apology â\x80\x93 and the fans love it. According to brand expert Dan
    Bradley, writing in Radio Today, the only reason Alan Jones will ever be sacked
    is if his ratings become uncompetitive.</p>\n\n<p>[T]he paradox of orchestrated
    social media campaigns, driven by people who are generally not listeners to either
    show, is that when they attack Jones or Sandilands, they are reinforcing the passion
    that the core fans feel for the show and for the personality.</p>\n\n<p>So, another
    echo chamber: one in which, following Prime Minister Gillardâ\x80\x99s misogyny
    speech, it would have been perfectly possible to wonder â\x80\x9Cwhat the fuss
    was aboutâ\x80\x9D. Is this â\x80\x93 Jonesworld â\x80\x93 the â\x80\x9Creal worldâ\x80\x9D
    of which the Australianâ\x80\x99s Angela Shanahan writes, in which nobody thinks
    misogyny is important, or even real? Could it be Jonesâ\x80\x99s western Sydney
    heartland that Shanahan is picturing when she writes of feminismâ\x80\x99s irrelevance
    to â\x80\x9Cwomen living in the rich, comfortable West in perfect equality with
    menâ\x80\x9D?</p>\n\n<p>Perfect equality. Perfect. Equality. I could stare at
    those words all day and still fail to see how they fit together in the context
    of women and men. But they remind me of something. When Alan Jones prefaced his
    â\x80\x9Cdestroying the jointâ\x80\x9D remark with a quote from Julia Gillardâ\x80\x99s
    Rarotonga speech (or, more likely, from the Australianâ\x80\x99s report of it),
    he omitted two key words. What Gillard said was: â\x80\x9CWe know that societies
    only reach their full potential if women are politically participating as equals.â\x80\x9D
    Two words too many for Mr Jones.</p>\n\n<p>The birth of the Destroy the Joint
    movement pre-dated by about seven weeks the prime ministerâ\x80\x99s misogyny
    speech. Itâ\x80\x99s not outlandish to imagine that the movementâ\x80\x99s existence,
    the conversation it had started, may have strengthened her hand. Whatever you
    think of Gillardâ\x80\x99s speech â\x80\x93 of its motives and sincerity â\x80\x93
    it will stand as a landmark: the breaking of a taboo, a marker of change.</p>\n\n<p>â\x80\x9CProgressives,â\x80\x9D
    writes Penny Wong in Destroying the Joint, â\x80\x9Care always on the lookout
    for signs of change â\x80¦ The hashtag destroyingthejoint signalled enough â\x80¦
    an underlying frustration with our societyâ\x80\x99s dominant voice that erupted
    in an online roar of â\x80\x98You donâ\x80\x99t speak for me!â\x80\x99â\x80\x9D</p>\n\n<p><em>Robyn

title: The Monthly's Hashtag Feminism lauds Leslie's Contribution to Destroying the
  Joint
--- "by Robyn Annear\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CDo you want to know how God turns a man into
  a feminist?â\x80\x9D asked Margie Abbott, addressing a business gathering in Penrith
  (the God-struck man in question being her husband, the federal Opposition leader).
  â\x80\x9CHe gives him three daughters.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nI donâ\x80\x99t believe it.
  My father dismissed women as sluts, nags, idiots and upstarts â\x80\x93 all except
  me, whom he loved to the stars. How can it be that a man feels no contradiction
  between the rancour he bears women in general (and uppity women in particular) and
  a wish for his own daughter to have every opportunity? All I know is that the siring
  of daughters is no inoculation against misogyny.\r\n\r\nMisogyny exerts a force
  on all our lives: girls to women, boys to men. Whether we mark it or not, it marks
  us. Yet unlike its vassal, sexism, only rarely is misogyny called out. Before Julia
  Gillardâ\x80\x99s spray in parliament last October, the word itself had long been
  relegated to the language of extremism: only a tabloid â\x80\x9Cman-haterâ\x80\x9D
  would talk of woman-hating. Since Gillard spoke its name, misogyny â\x80\x93 the
  word and its meaning â\x80\x93 has been drawn from the shadow into the light, from
  the margin to the mainstream.\r\n\r\nPolitics, like talkback radio, brings out the
  worst in people. The context of Gillardâ\x80\x99s misogyny speech â\x80\x93 she
  was opposing a motion to sack the speaker, Peter Slipper, for vile, sexist utterances
  â\x80\x93 gave credence to those who would dismiss it as a diversion, if not outright
  hypocrisy. Her recent chumminess with shock-jock Kyle Sandilands, as brazen a misogynist
  as ever donned a rabbit suit, deepened the impression that Gillardâ\x80\x99s reproach
  of Tony Abbott had more to do with expediency than conviction. Angela Shanahan crowed
  in the Australian that, with an election in the offing, Gillard was showing her
  true colours, spurning â\x80\x9Cthe sort of people who tweet to the ABCâ\x80\x99s
  Q&Aâ\x80\x9D in favour of the crucial young, blue-collar demographic that tunes
  in to Kyle and Jackie O on Sydney radio. Shanahan wrote:\r\n\r\nEven though they
  loom large in their own estimation, the support of bloggers and trolls and twits
  and other assorted virtual viragos is not enough. Real people are really not online
  24/7 â\x80¦ Nobody in the real world thought misogyny was important. And no one
  thought it was real.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nChief among the â\x80\x9Cvirtual viragosâ\x80\x9D
  whose realness Shanahan called into question are the women (â\x80\x9Ca handful of
  tens of thousandsâ\x80\x9D) behind Destroy the Joint, an online movement targeting
  misogyny and sexism. The movement began as a Twitter hashtag on the last day of
  August 2012 in response to an incendiary remark lobbed by Alan Jones on his radio
  show that morning: â\x80\x9CWomen are destroying the joint â\x80¦â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nSome
  context. Jones was talking on air with Nationals Senator Barnaby Joyce, their ostensible
  topic the threatened sale of Cubbie Station, a massive irrigation property in Joyceâ\x80\x99s
  south-west Queensland electorate, to a majority Chinese-owned buyer. Joyce proposed
  instead that the government buy Cubbie Station, â\x80\x9Csplit it up into small
  places, sell the farms back to Australian farmers and keep a bit of water for the
  environment and everyoneâ\x80\x99s happyâ\x80\x9D. At which point Jones pointed
  to an initiative announced a couple of days earlier by Prime Minister Gillard at
  the Pacific Islands Forum. â\x80\x9CSheâ\x80\x99s promised $320 million to promote
  â\x80\x98gender equalityâ\x80\x99 in the Pacific region.â\x80\x9D The two men shared
  a laugh, and Jones went on:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFair dinkum, mate. This is borrowed
  money â\x80\x93 $320 million to increase the number of Pacific women in leadership
  and decision-making roles, to increase womenâ\x80\x99s access to financial services
  and markets, to improve the safety of women through better violence prevention.
  She [the prime minister] said, â\x80\x9CWe know that societies only reach their
  full potential if women are politically participating.â\x80\x9D Women are destroying
  the joint â\x80\x93 Christine Nixon in Melbourne, Clover Moore here. Honestly.\r\n\r\n
  \r\n\r\nGetting wind of Jonesâ\x80\x99s remark later that day, writer and commentator
  Jane Caro tweeted:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGot time on my hands tonight so thought Iâ\x80\x99d
  spend it coming up with new ways of â\x80\x9Cdestroying the jointâ\x80\x9D being
  a woman & all. Ideas welcome.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCaroâ\x80\x99s tweet sparked the #destroythejoint
  Twitter conversation and, two days later, a Destroy the Joint Facebook page. Thousands
  enlarged the conversation by tweeting and retweeting,â\x80\x89â\x80\x9Clikeâ\x80\x9D-ing,
  sharing and commenting. But the movement really took off a month later, after Jones
  told a gathering of Young Liberals that Gillardâ\x80\x99s recently deceased father
  had died of shame. In protest, Destroy the Joint supporters (along with the Sack
  Alan Jones movement) mobilised to put pressure on Jonesâ\x80\x99s advertisers to
  withdraw their sponsorship of his program. And it worked. Mercedes even took his
  car away.\r\n\r\nMonths later, Destroy the Joint is still going strong, with tens
  of thousands of followers and a broader reach across social media (â\x80\x9CFriends
  of Fansâ\x80\x9D) amounting to millions. Every day it carries posts calling out,
  and calling for action against, sexism and misogyny worldwide â\x80\x93 from John
  Lawsâ\x80\x99s despicable questioning of a 14-year-old rape victim, to the gang
  rape and killing of Indian student Jyoti Singh Pandey, to Telstraâ\x80\x99s insistence
  on payment for providing a silent phone number to a woman taking refuge from a violent
  partner.\r\n\r\nNow Jane Caro has edited Destroying the Joint: Why women have to
  change the world (UQP; $29.95), a collection of writing by Australian women, which
  brings the spirit of #destroythejoint into what Angela Shanahan might call the real
  world. Contributor Jennifer Mills writes that â\x80\x9Csocial media is us, in all
  our multiplicity of concerns, perspectives, agendas, obsessions and flawsâ\x80\x9D,
  which also serves as a fair description of the book that has grown out of the online
  movement.\r\n\r\nThe 27 contributions that make up Destroying the Joint range across
  essays, analysis and commentary to memoir, fiction, humour and invective. The collection
  has its share of flakiness, cheap shots, box-ticking and score-settling, for assembling
  a collection of this kind is always a dicey undertaking. The compilers approach
  potential contributors and, faced with short lead-times, have pretty much to be
  content with what they get. The fiction contributions to Destroying the Joint are
  especially ham-fisted. But among the rest there are standouts.\r\n\r\nLeslie Cannold
  explains the significance of what feminist Dale Spender calls the â\x80\x9Cone-third
  ruleâ\x80\x9D: â\x80\x9CThirty per cent is the point of critical minority and therefore
  critical change.â\x80\x9D When womenâ\x80\x99s participation â\x80\x93 in the workplace,
  media, parliament, wherever â\x80\x93 hits 30%, they become visible. In many fields
  of Australian society, thatâ\x80\x99s where we are now. At the same time as womenâ\x80\x99s
  visibility makes them count in ways they havenâ\x80\x99t up till now â\x80\x93 as
  role models, mentors, and agents of influence and change â\x80\x93 it also makes
  them targets in a way they havenâ\x80\x99t been before. The 30% mark is not in itself
  a destination, writes Cannold, but â\x80\x9Ccan serve as an effective staging post
  from which equality-minded citizens can consolidate and gather forces for the final
  assault on the male citadel and a true and total sharing of powerâ\x80\x9D â\x80\x93
  for joint-destroying, in other words.\r\n\r\nCarmen Lawrence broadens the brief
  to point out that we are all destroying the joint, our planet. She reminds us about
  prescient women like Rachel Carson and Judith Wright who sounded the alarm about
  humankindâ\x80\x99s despoliation and exploitation of the natural environment. But
  she over-elaborates, so that the readerâ\x80\x99s solidarity wears thin long before
  the essay ends. (Although itâ\x80\x99s not the longest in the book, it feels like
  it.)\r\n\r\nEmily Maguire also brings a welcome wider perspective to the joint-destroying
  enterprise by presenting examples of womenâ\x80\x99s leadership and activism in
  the developing world, in illustration of the point made by the prime minister (and
  quoted by Alan Jones) â\x80\x9Cthat societies only reach their full potential if
  women are politically participatingâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nThe most thoughtful and wise
  piece in the collection is Senator Penny Wongâ\x80\x99s. Reflecting on reactions
  to Gillardâ\x80\x99s misogyny speech, she quotes Susie Oâ\x80\x99Brien of Melbourneâ\x80\x99s
  Herald Sun: â\x80\x9CWhile men wondered what all the fuss was about, many women
  around the nation cheered.â\x80\x9D Wong goes on:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPerhaps the men,
  and some women, who made it clear that they didnâ\x80\x99t understand â\x80\x9Cwhat

  misogyny, it did not carry the same emotional weight for them. This serves as a
  reminder of the divergent realities that co-exist within our community, that we
  still often cannot see how different things are for others.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWongâ\x80\x99s
  acknowledgement of â\x80\x9Cdivergent realitiesâ\x80\x9D stands out as the only
  bridge this collection offers between the Destroy the Joint ethosphere and other

  most, a vague pulse of recognition: â\x80\x9CDoes it have something to do with Alan

  the insularity of hashtag activism: social media as echo chamber. Jennifer Mills

  (or, more likely, from the Australianâ\x80\x99s report of it), he omitted two key
  words. What Gillard said was: â\x80\x9CWe know that societies only reach their full
  potential if women are politically participating as equals.â\x80\x9D Two words too
  many for Mr Jones.\r\n\r\nThe birth of the Destroy the Joint movement pre-dated
  by about seven weeks the prime ministerâ\x80\x99s misogyny speech. Itâ\x80\x99s
  not outlandish to imagine that the movementâ\x80\x99s existence, the conversation
  it had started, may have strengthened her hand. Whatever you think of Gillardâ\x80\x99s
  speech â\x80\x93 of its motives and sincerity â\x80\x93 it will stand as a landmark:
  the breaking of a taboo, a marker of change.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CProgressives,â\x80\x9D
  writes Penny Wong in Destroying the Joint, â\x80\x9Care always on the lookout for
  signs of change â\x80¦ The hashtag destroyingthejoint signalled enough â\x80¦ an
  underlying frustration with our societyâ\x80\x99s dominant voice that erupted in
  an online roar of â\x80\x98You donâ\x80\x99t speak for me!â\x80\x99â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\n*Robyn
