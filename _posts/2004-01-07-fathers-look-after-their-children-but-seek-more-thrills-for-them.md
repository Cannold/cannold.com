    because this time, when Steve Irwin stepped into the arena at his\r\nSunshine
    Coast wildlife park and used one hand to feed a dead chicken to\r\na 4m crocodile
    named Murray, clutched in the other was his tiny\r\none-month-old son, Robert.\r\n\r\nFor
    some, the hubbub that followed is a whole lot of fuss about nothing.\r\nWhy call
    the child protection authorities or threaten Irwinâ\x80\x99s nomination\r\nfor
    Australian of the Year? The man is an expert and knew exactly what\r\nhe was doing.\r\n\r\nIrwin
    himself agrees. â\x80\x9CI was in complete control,â\x80\x9D he insisted at a
    news\r\nconference the day after the incident. In complete control? Come on,\r\nwhoever
    is?\r\n\r\nAnd that is precisely the point.\r\n\r\nThe reason Irwin has found
    himself on the sharp end of so much\r\nfinger-pointing is that his behaviour provides
    us an opportunity - as a\r\nsociety â\x80\x94 to trumpet to the rooftops our collective
    values and standards\r\nabout the right way to raise kids.\r\n\r\nWhat we Australians
    tend to believe (rightly, in my view) is that\r\nregardless of how much risk Irwin
    was actually putting his young son at,\r\nany risk at all ~~- if it is avoidable~~-
    is too much when it comes to\r\nchildren. Particularly children that are so young
    that not only do they\r\nlack any capacity to defend themselves, but even to express
    their\r\nfeelings or desires about what is happening to them.\r\n\r\nFar from
    being petty or over the top, the chatter of disapproval\r\nsurrounding Irwinâ\x80\x99s
    decision to make his young son part of the show\r\nserves an important social
    purpose: constructing and then reinforcing\r\nour collective moral beliefs about
    how parents should - and should not -\r\nbehave.\r\n\r\nBut beneath such values
    talk lurks something more sinister. A belief, or\r\nperhaps just a suspicion,
    that men simply lack what it takes to be good\r\nparents to young children.\r\n\r\nLike
    Michael Jackson, who just over a year ago became embroiled in a\r\nsimilar controversy
    when he dangled his infant over a hotel balcony,\r\nIrwin comes across as a man
    of his generation: a loving, enthusiastic\r\nand seemingly hands-on father.\r\n\r\nBut
    this may be the problem, because the behaviour of both superstars\r\nseems to
    have unearthed longstanding beliefs that, when it comes to\r\nlooking after infants
    fathers just donâ\x80\x99t have what it takes.\r\n\r\nThey are simply too noisy,
    too rough, too danger loving - in a word, too\r\nunwomanly - to provide the gentle
    care and tender nurture that young\r\nchildren need to thrive and to survive.\\\r\nThis
    is mostly rubbish, though like all lies it does contain a grain of\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nAnd
    that is that while fathers are more than capable of caring properly\r\nfor children
    of all ages, they will not parent in the same way as\r\nmothers. While there is
    no doubt that modern-day fathers are still\r\nfeeling their way towards a child-rearing
    style that is uniquely their\r\nown - and that getting the precise formula right
    may take time - it is a\r\ncertainty that as long as men are less risk-averse
    than women, fathers\r\nwill raise their children in more thrill-filled ways than
    do mothers.\r\n\r\nAnd while dangling kids near crocodiles and over railings is
    extreme and\r\nshould be ruled out of bounds, I feel confident in saying that
    exposure\r\nto the different parenting styles of both genders wonâ\x80\x99t damage
    kids.\r\n\r\nIt may even do them good. For in observing - early on and on a\r\nday-to-day
    basis - the ways mums and dads think, show love, play and\r\nsimply go about the
    business of getting things done, kids are learning\r\nthe most valuable lesson
    of all: that in most of the ways that matter,\r\nwomen and men are pretty much
    the same.\r\n\r\nBut itâ\x80\x99s those differences that keep things interesting."
