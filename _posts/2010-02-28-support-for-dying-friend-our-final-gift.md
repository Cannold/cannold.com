  content: "A READER - a qualified scientist Iâ\x80\x99ll call Ron - asks for my view
    on a\r\ndilemma that pitted his personal and professional integrity, and belief\r\nin
    absolute truths, against his love for a dying friend.\r\n\r\nRonâ\x80\x99s friend,
    also a scientist, was dying of cancer. â\x80\x9CHe said that he\r\nwould never
    use magic bullets,â\x80\x9D Ron says, â\x80\x9Cbut after two years of great\r\npain
    he turned to â\x80¦ a [medical] device I knew â\x80¦ was a blatant scam.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nShould
    Ron have been honest and told his friend what he thought about\r\nhis medical
    choices, or supported his friend in the choices he made,\r\nwhatever Ron thought
    of them? Ron chose to keep his mouth shut. His\r\nfriend died some months later.
    Now, he wonders, did he do the right\r\nthing?\r\n\r\nI think so. What really
    mattered in this situation was that Ron kept\r\nfaith with the requirements of
    being a friend, not with his beliefs\r\nabout the importance of medical interventions
    having a base in evidence.\r\nHis friend was terminally ill and the Western medical
    kit bag was\r\nclearly empty so whatever he chose to do or not do was not likely
    to\r\nsubstantially alter the final result.\r\n\r\nPeople at the end stage of
    a terminal illness have two options. One is\r\nto put their affairs in order and
    live their life to the fullest, in\r\nfull knowledge that death is imminent. The
    other is to fight, not\r\nnecessarily in the belief they can win, but to assert
    control by\r\nresisting the unwanted end.\r\n\r\nIn Helen Garnerâ\x80\x99s novel
    *The Spare Room*, the dying Nicola injects\r\nmassive doses of vitamin C, then
    tosses off the pain and noxious side\r\neffects as evidence the intervention is
    â\x80\x9Csavaging the tumours and\r\ndriving them outâ\x80\x9D. Nicolaâ\x80\x99s
    friend, Helen, rails at Nicolaâ\x80\x99s naivety.\r\nâ\x80\x9CTheir treatments
    are bullshit, Nicola. Theyâ\x80\x99re ripping you off. They\r\ncanâ\x80\x99t cure
    cancer.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nBut the truth is that what frightens and enrages Helen
    is not Nicolaâ\x80\x99s\r\nnon-evidence-based approach to medicine. Itâ\x80\x99s
    her friendâ\x80\x99s refusal to\r\naccept her own death. â\x80\x9CYouâ\x80\x99re
    using that bloody clinic to distract\r\nyourself,â\x80\x9D Helen tells Nicola.\\\r\nâ\x80\x9CDonâ\x80\x99t
    say it, Hel,â\x80\x9D says Nicola. She raises one palm. â\x80\x9CDonâ\x80\x99t
    tell me.â\x80\x9D\r\nBut Helen wonâ\x80\x99t be stopped. â\x80\x9CYouâ\x80\x99ve
    got to get ready.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIt is easier for those of us who love and care
    for the terminally ill to\r\nwitness their smooth transition through the Kubler-Ross
    stages of dying:\r\ndenial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. We sleep
    better\r\nknowing that as their time approached, our friend or family member was\r\nâ\x80\x9Creadyâ\x80\x9D
    and â\x80\x9Cat peaceâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that not everyone does dying
    the same way. Some will never\r\ncome to acceptance. They will â\x80\x9Cgo on
    fighting right to their last\r\nbreathâ\x80\x9D, explains the nurse who comes
    to look after Nicola. â\x80\x9CAnd it is\r\none way of doing it.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nFor
    Helen, it was recognising that it was not the idiotic fruitlessness\r\nof Nicolaâ\x80\x99s
    vitamin C detox that was distressing and enraging her. It\r\nwas Nicolaâ\x80\x99s
    inability to â\x80\x9Cwork towards a glorious moment of\r\nenlightenmentâ\x80\x9D
    and to admit she was dying and, by so doing, allow Helen\r\nand others who loved
    her to accept and be open about it, too.\r\n\r\nHowever painful we find it, supporting
    our friends to die as they see\r\nfit can be our final gift to them. Biting his
    tongue, as Ron did about\r\nthe sham nature of his friendâ\x80\x99s last-ditch
    medical efforts, didnâ\x80\x99t\r\ncompromise Ronâ\x80\x99s integrity. It gave
    his friend permission to die\r\nfighting and was the act of a true friend."
