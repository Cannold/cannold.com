    better than Anne Summers, a woman who lists among her\r\nachievements the best-selling
    book Damned Whores and Godâ\x80\x99s Police,\r\nadvisor to former Prime Minister
    Keating and Officer of the Order of\r\nAustralia for services to journalism and
    women, to write about the most\r\npressing social problem of our time: the tragic
    imbalance between work\r\nand family responsibilities, and the devastating impact
    it is having on\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99s well-being and the nationâ\x80\x99s capacity
    to reproduce itself?\r\n\r\nHeaven knows there has been no shortage of column
    inches dedicated to\r\nthe problem, as well as diligent hand-wringing and sympathetic
    clucking\r\nnoises from the Howard government. Yet while the problem seems to
    worsen\r\nalmost hourly, the Government does nothing. The reason for this, Summers\r\nexplains,
    is that the Governmentâ\x80\x99s ideological preference for\r\ntraditional family
    arrangements - where Daddy brings home the bacon and\r\nMum cares for house and
    kids - precludes it from implementing policies\r\ndesigned to reduce working womenâ\x80\x99s
    stress.\r\n\r\nTo the contrary, this bias leads the Government to blatantly\r\ndiscriminate
    against families where both parents work by viciously\r\nunderfunding childcare,
    and implementing tax and benefit policies that\r\nleave families with two earner
    $75 a week worse off on average than\r\nthose with only one. Summers argues that
    Australian women are often\r\nunaware of such discriminatory policies because
    of the governmentâ\x80\x99s\r\ndecision to either eliminate or enfeeble the agencies
    that in the past\r\nnot only would have publicly argued against them, bout kept
    ongoing tabs\r\non the impact they were having on womenâ\x80\x99s equality.\r\n\r\nClose
    to forty years on the political stage has done nothing to taint or\r\nmuffle Summersâ\x80\x99
    activist indignation and thirsting for justice. She is\r\nnot afraid to name names
    in her expansive discussion of how both Labour\r\nand Liberal politicians have
    failed women, as well as tossing bouquets\r\nat the few men - Victorian QC Chris
    Maxwell comes in for special mention\r\n- who use their power and influence to
    pursue justice for women. Given\r\nthat she was amongst the band of optimistic
    second-wave feminists who\r\nconfidently predicted that the mere presence of more
    women in Canberra\r\nwould make a difference, I particularly admired her willingness
    to\r\nexpress disappointment in the 60 female members and senators who now\r\ncomprise
    over a quarter of pollies on the Federal benches for failing to\r\nagitate on
    behalf of women. Emilyâ\x80\x99s List (the Labour womenâ\x80\x99s\r\norganization
    that funds progressive female candidates) rightly comes in\r\nfor particular scrutiny
    for its inability - despite requiring all the\r\ncandidates it funds to demonstrate
    that they are pro-choice and\r\npro-childcare - to â\x80\x9Cgalvaniseâ\x80\x9D
    women to act on these commitments once\r\nelected.\r\n\r\nThroughout the book,
    Summers reveals herself to be a woman who doesnâ\x80\x99t\r\njust get mad, but
    gets active. She writes unselfconsciously (as if\r\neveryone leaps into constructive
    action when their fundamental values\r\nare challenged) about her outrage at Prime
    Minister Howardâ\x80\x99s failure to\r\nappoint a female Governor General, and
    his subsequent leaking to the\r\nmedia that he desired to do so (leaving the clear
    impression that there\r\nwasnâ\x80\x99t a single woman in the country who was
    qualified). Grabbing a copy\r\nof Whoâ\x80\x99s Who, it took Summers less than
    an hour to come up with 45 names\r\nof women who were more than qualified for
    the post.\r\n\r\nI must admit to being somewhat disappointed by the analysis Summers\r\nprovides
    of the causes of - and cures for - the work/family crunch and\r\nresultant â\x80\x9Cfertility
    strike.â\x80\x9D Unlike her discussion of violence and the\r\nsubterranean but
    highly politically sophisticated way in which the\r\nHoward government has â\x80\x9Cdisappearedâ\x80\x9D
    women from the political agenda -\r\nwhere she clearly knows her way well around
    the factual and conceptual\r\nterrain - she consistently fails to call on the
    intellectual apparatus\r\nneeded to make sense of the varied and complex things
    women want, do and\r\nsettle for when it comes to work and family. There is no
    doubt this\r\nareas is complicated, with seeming contradictions at every turn.
    What to\r\nmake, for instance, of repeated surveys that show that young Australian\r\nwomen
    are as committed as young men to the paid workforce (to remaining\r\nâ\x80\x9Cattachedâ\x80\x9D
    to it and progressing up the career ladder), but others that\r\nreveal substantial
    numbers of women claiming to â\x80\x9Cchooseâ\x80\x9D total\r\nwithdrawal from
    the paid workforce or insecure part-time non-career\r\nrelated jobs when they
    become mothers? â\x80\x9CConstrained choiceâ\x80\x9D and the\r\nmeaning of being
    a â\x80\x9Cnon-chooserâ\x80\x9D in liberal democratic societies like\r\nAustralia
    are just some of the concepts found in thoughtful feminist\r\nanalysis of womenâ\x80\x99s
    work/life decisions that would have assisted Summers\r\nto both explain such trends,
    and point the way ahead.\r\n\r\nBut if youâ\x80\x99ve got a pulse and care about
    justice for women, youâ\x80\x99re sure\r\nto finish the book itching to do something
    - anything - to catapult\r\nwomenâ\x80\x99s quest for equality back on to the
    national agenda. Wisely,\r\nSummers is prepared, dedicating her final chapter
    to a list of â\x80\x9Cten ways\r\nto change the worldâ\x80\x9D and a directory
    of the relevant organizations and\r\nindividuals to contact to make your displeasure
    known. Since going to\r\npress, she has even put this information up on her new
    website\r\n(annesummers.com.au) where - with the aid of hyperlinks - it is even\r\neasier
    to get started.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CDonâ\x80\x99t get mad,â\x80\x9D Summers advises,
    â\x80\x9Cget justice.â\x80\x9D The rest she knows, is\r\nup to us."
