    have sex with prostitutes working in brothels or on the street face\r\nhefty fines
    or six months in gaol, while the women involved will be\r\noffered assistance
    to exit the industry. â\x80\x9CWe want to send a clear\r\nmessage to men that
    buying sex is unacceptable,â\x80\x9D said the Norwegian\r\nJustice Minister, echoing
    the sentiments of Swedish detective Kajsa\r\nWahlberg. â\x80\x9CWe donâ\x80\x99t
    have a problem with prostitutes. We have a problem\r\nwith men who buy sex.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nSwedenâ\x80\x99s
    first attempts to move away from a liberal, harm-minimisation\r\napproach to prostitution
    began in 1997. Then, everyone laughed. No one\r\nis laughing now, with a number
    of EU countries having either adopted\r\nelements of the recriminalisation approach,
    or considering doing so in\r\nthe future. Australia could be next. The â\x80\x9Cwomen-as-victimâ\x80\x9D
    paradigm on\r\nwhich recriminalisation is based is the brain-child of radical
    English\r\nfeminist Sheila Jeffreys, now based in Melbourne, and is supported
    by\r\nconservative Christian groups like Womenâ\x80\x99s Forum Australia and the\r\nAustralian
    Christian Lobby.\r\n\r\nProstitution and substance-abuse pose significant policy
    dilemmas for\r\nliberal democratic societies. This is because the foundational
    claim of\r\nsuch political cultures-that competent, rational citizens are entitled\r\nto
    make their own decisions, even if we think they are wrong-clash with\r\nthe widely
    shared view that some choices are not just mistaken, but\r\nharmful for those
    involved and for society at large. Recriminalisation\r\ncapitalises on this conundrum
    in two ways.\r\n\r\nFirstly, by conflating things that should remain separate
    to make the\r\nproblem seem larger, and the harms greater, than they are. Making
    paid,\r\nconsensual sex in a legal brothel the same as sex slavery; the one-time\r\nuse
    by a student of marijuana as no different to heroin addiction.\r\nSecondly, by
    manipulating our reflexive sympathy for the vulnerable into\r\nagreement that
    for some people, choice is a hazard, and so need not be\r\ndefended. Instead,
    we just need to say, â\x80\x9Cno.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99m not convinced. Prohibitionist
    rhetoric and policy has a lousy track\r\nrecord, no matter how desperately radical
    feminists and conservative\r\nChristians join forces to convince us otherwise.
    Sure, it may work for\r\nsome people in some cases, but the resistant rump are
    just forced\r\nunderground, attracting both shame and stigma as they descend.
    Like it\r\nor not, substance use and paid sex will always be with us. Criminalising\r\nthem
    just makes it harder for harm minimisation policies aimed at\r\npreventing the
    transmission of HIV/AIDS and minimising the risk of\r\nviolence to succeed.\r\n\r\nJust
    as worrying is the harm caused to those that the new approach\r\nreinscribes as
    victims. The language is telling. Liberals speak of sex\r\nworkers and drug users.
    Paternalists describe prostituted women and\r\naddicts-adults incapable of making
    good choices and so requiring legal\r\nrescue from their consequences.\r\n\r\nWomen,
    in particular should beware. Professor Jeffreys says the\r\nsubjugation of the
    prostituted woman is a microcosm of all womenâ\x80\x99s\r\ndomination by men.
    She faults straight sex, which she sees as the means\r\nby which men maintain
    power over women and perpetuate the patriarchy,\r\nwhich explains her belief that
    real feminists must be lesbians. What\r\nsocial re-jigs might be required to resist
    such subjugation is anyoneâ\x80\x99s\r\nguess, though Iâ\x80\x99m sure it will
    be for our own good.\r\n\r\nAnd here lies the problem. Exploited people - women,
    drug-users - may\r\ndeserve our pity, but they donâ\x80\x99t deserve our trust.
    We need to empower\r\npeople to make better choices, not deny them any chance
    to control their\r\nlives."
