  is deft at evoking the dry, humble landscape of her characterâ\x80\x99s lives, bringing
  a fresh but spare beauty to her tale. She is also adept at creating characters that
  live and breathe.*\r\n\r\n*Nina Bourke, [Perilous Adventure](http://cannold.com/articles/article/perilous-adventure-a-fan-of-the-book-of-rachael/)*\r\n\r\n\r\n>
  *One of the strongest aspects of [the] novel is the fraught relationship between
  Rachael and her mother, Miriame. Far from the saintly Virgin Mary of tradition,
  Miriame is a waspish-tongued domestic tyrant determined to get her wayward daughter
  doing what she was born to do: sweep the floor. Yet Rachael comes to the point when
  she realises Miriame is trying to do her best for her, to prepare her for the strict
  and unforgiving society she will have to live in. [Says Cannold]  â\x80\x9CWho wants
  to pass down these rules? But on the other hand, how can you not?* \r\n\r\n*[Jane
