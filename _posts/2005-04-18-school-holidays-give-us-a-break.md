    and seemingly never done. My problem, in a nutshell, is\r\nwhile Iâ\x80\x99d be
    happy to have the kids at home, the demands of my work mean\r\nthis only sporadically
    and occasionally possible. Most of the time, I\r\nneed care. This means that every
    time those dreaded two weeks draw near,\r\nmy â\x80\x9Cto-doâ\x80\x9D list looks

    away from\r\nthe period in question. Then, ask my partner what days might be\r\navailable
    at his office when the other directors wonâ\x80\x99t have their kids\r\nwith them,
    clients wonâ\x80\x99t be visiting and heâ\x80\x99ll be able to shift his\r\nworkload
    around enough to send a few employees home so that he can park\r\nour kids in
    front of computer games and the world wide web for the day.\r\nSimultaneously
    SOS everyone on my â\x80\x9Cworking parentsâ\x80\x9D email contact list\r\nto
    discover if we can coordinate care swaps (of the â\x80\x9CIâ\x80\x99ll take your\r\nolder

    make similar arrangements for the younger ones on those days tooâ\x80\x9D -\r\ntype)
    or mutual activities (of the â\x80\x9Cmine will only go to sports camp if\r\nyour
    child goes tooâ\x80\x9D - type). Finally, ring up both sets of grandparents\r\nand
    plead for the odd day or three\r\n\r\nBy the time that final Friday arvo bell
    rings (one hour earlier than\r\nusual, just to add insult to injury) my desktop
    resembles a war room.\r\nPhone ringing, palm pilot synching, incoming e-mail indicator
    bobbing\r\nlike a jack in the box, and - as testament to my weeks of effort -
    a\r\ncalendar hastily blu-tacked to the wall splattered with victorious blue\r\ntics
    and a measle-rash of red question marks.\r\n\r\nPerhaps not surprisingly, I find
    this process depressing. Not just\r\nbecause of the persistence, eye for detail
    and logistical ingenuity it\r\nentails, but its sheer repetitiveness. It feels
    like Iâ\x80\x99ve only just\r\nrecovered from organising myself for one school
    holiday, when the next\r\none looms. I also find it frustrating that in spite
    of my efforts, my\r\nchildren nearly always end up attending programs that are
    either low\r\nquality, exorbitantly expensive or - when things really go pear-shaped
    -\r\nboth. And Iâ\x80\x99m one of the lucky ones: at least I can afford some paid\r\ncare.
    A recent study showed that many Australian parents canâ\x80\x99t, and are\r\ninstead
    forced to take their annual leave at different times to cover\r\nthe mismatch
    between the demands of work and those of school breaks.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that
    the decision to divide the approximately 11 weeks\r\nannual leave to which teachers
    and students are entitled into three two\r\nweeks breaks, and five weeks around
    Christmas, reeks of 1950s\r\nassumptions about parental work patterns that have
    relevance for\r\nfamilies of today.\r\n\r\nABS figures show that around half of
    families with children under 15\r\nhave both parents in the workforce. While many
    mothers (and a handful of\r\nfathers) reduce their hours to reconcile the daily
    incongruity between\r\nschool and work hours, part-time work doesnâ\x80\x99t solve
    the problems caused\r\nby school holidays. For this, parents need a â\x80\x9Cterm
    timeâ\x80\x9D clause in their\r\ncontract. In one UK survey, 38% of women and
    32% of men said they did or\r\nwould use such a clause if it were available to
    them. With 47% of women\r\nand 34% of Australian men rating the freedom not to
    work during school\r\nholidays as important, one might imagine a similarly enthusiastic\r\nresponse
    here.\r\n\r\nYet many scholars now believe that parents are increasingly interested\r\nin
    changing the world so they can balance work and family, rather than\r\nusing â\x80\x9Cspecial
    benefitsâ\x80\x9D solutions to reduce the imbalance. In part,\r\nthis is likely
    to be because of the negative impact parental use of\r\npart-time work, flexi-time
    and other such arrangements tends to have on\r\ntheir wages, career progression
    and job security. Instead, parents want\r\ninstitutions - like work and school
    - to change to better suit them.\r\n\r\nHow could this be done? My proposal is
    that for most of the year, school\r\nshould be a heads down/bums up affair, with
    breaks of only one week\r\nduring the spring and autumn. This leaves around 8
    weeks for an extended\r\nbreak over the summer which could start before Christmas
    and run through\r\nmost of February.\r\n\r\nNot only would this approach keep
    kids out of the classroom during the\r\nhottest days of the year, and return to
    families of lesser means the\r\nfreedom to holiday together, it would also enable
    the summer camp\r\nbusiness - day and overnight - to develop and thrive.\r\n\r\nSuch
    camps would offer high quality care for children at lower costs in\r\npart because
    every year staff, food, insurance and transport need to be\r\norganised only once.
    And, mercifully, only once would also be the number\r\nof times parents needing
    care for their children during the break would\r\nneed to examine the options,
    pay their money and make their choice."
