    for womenâ\x80\x9D as its critics claim. Not only had she\r\ninvited some of the
    â\x80\x9Cladiesâ\x80\x9D to pop her balloons, but the showâ\x80\x99s\r\nemphasis

    credentials.\r\n\r\nGale might also have pointed to the history of burlesque as
    further\r\nevidence as its right-on credentials. Originating in the early Victorian\r\nera
    when tensions between the aristocracy and working-class were high,\r\nburlesque
    saw performers in outfits considered inappropriate for polite\r\nsociety mock
    high-brow entertainment forms as opera, Shakespearean\r\ndrama, musicals, and
    ballet. However, just before the crackdown in the\r\n1930s that saw the genre
    disappear, burlesque had been reduced to little\r\nmore than strip shows where
    young, rural, poverty-stricken gals got\r\ntheir kit off for money. Revived as
    part of the retro- craze of the\r\n1990s, its continued flourishing at the start
    of the 21st may be\r\nattributable to the rise of â\x80\x9Craunchâ\x80\x9D culture.\r\n\r\nIs
    burlesque sexist? While there is little doubt that on some issues we\r\ncan agree
    to disagree, Iâ\x80\x99m unconvinced this is one of them. This is\r\nbecause like
    the charge of racism, sexism is not a trivial accusation,\r\nbut a highly charged
    moral one that stamps â\x80\x9Coppressiveâ\x80\x9D (burdensome,\r\narbitrary,
    unjust and/or tyrannical exercise of power) on the accused.\r\nThose making such
    accusations, in other words, have an obligation to\r\nbelieve they have truth,
    not just opinion, on their side.\r\n\r\nIf any form of sexual entertainment is
    deemed inappropriate at all\r\nserious work-related events, than in this context
    burlesque - as well as\r\npole and belly-dancing - stands condemned. But if burlesque
    is not just\r\nsexual but sexist, than like minstrel shows in which white actors\r\nblackened
    their faces and lampooned stereotypical depictions of blacks,\r\nits suitability
    as entertainment in any context must be questioned.\r\n\r\nWith all due respect
    to Ms Gale, it is unclear to me why the fact that\r\nfemale audience members received
    the same number of invitations to pop\r\nher balloons defends against the charge
    of sexism. Would anyone\r\nseriously argue that because the mothers often wrapped
    and unwrapped the\r\ncloth that crippled their young daughtersâ\x80\x99 feet,
    that the ancient\r\nChinese practice of foot binding was not gender-based oppression?\r\n\r\nAnd
    while many of us applaud the expansion of forums in which female\r\nphysical types
    other than young, blonde and busty are sexualised,\r\namending this aspect of
    our cultureâ\x80\x99s eroticisation of women does not\r\nnecessarily, or on its
    own, empower us. As well, while the ways in which\r\nwomen are constructed as
    hot or not matters, it must at least take equal\r\nplace beside the important
    feminist goal of defending a womanâ\x80\x99s right to\r\noccupy public space and
    garner public respect regardless of whether men\r\nfind her horny.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    for some women, the infiltration of burlesque, belly-dancing\r\nand other traditional
    womanly arts is proof-positive that we no longer\r\nneed to worry about this problem.
    Who else but women supremely confident\r\nthat they are taken seriously as citizens
    and fully-rounded human beings\r\nat home, at school and at work would dare to
    reintroduce dress and dance\r\nforms that throughout history has been emblematic
    of the highly\r\nconstrained ways women had to arouse recognition, interest and
    approval\r\nfrom men. Surely, some young women may feel, the creation of a world
    in\r\nwhich women are free to introduce the all-too-human yen to be seen as\r\ndesirable
    in their everyday persona, without fear of misogynist\r\nstereotyping and career
    death, was what the feminist revolution was all\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nWell, wresting
    our fair share of financial and political freedom and\r\npower from men in order
    to gain greater control of our lives was in\r\nthere, too. And while some burlesque
    performers defend the female nature\r\nof the sexuality expressed by the genre
    (more foreplay, less\r\nin-your-face T & A) there seems little thatâ\x80\x99s
    new in either the glitter\r\nand tassel of the cleavage-focused costumes, or the
    manner in which the\r\nperformers strut around in them. Real sexual freedom, notes
    author of\r\nFemale Chauvinist Pigs Ariel Levy, requires us to figure out what
    we\r\ninternally want from sex instead of mimicking whatever popular culture\"\r\n-
    of any era I might add - â\x80\x9Cholds up to us as sexy.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThereâ\x80\x99s
    a time and a place for everything, and that includes feeling\r\nsexy and finding
    someone else hot. Burlesque had its time and place,\r\ntoo. The challenge for
    contemporary women is to find ways of being\r\nâ\x80\x9Csexyâ\x80\x9D - of inviting
    desire and desiring - that do not call on gendered\r\nstereotypes from an unequal
    past, nor succumb to a market-based\r\nuniversalisation of desire."
