    Women's Day 2013 this Friday, Alana Schetzer shines the\r\nspotlight on Melbourne's
    most influential females*\r\n\r\nAustralian women have made huge strides since
    an International Conference of Working Women in Copenhagen in 1910 came up with
    the idea of a day to honour the achievements of women around the world and recognise
    the struggle for equality. Australia has a female prime minister, a female governor-
    general, a female attorney-general and a smattering of women on the boards of
    our largest companies.\r\n\r\nBut on the eve of the 2013 International Womenâ\x80\x99s
    Day, on March 8, itâ\x80\x99s clear the battle for equality between the sexes
    is far from won. According to the latest figures Australian women earned 17 per
    cent less than men in 2012 and just 10 per cent of managerial positions and about
    25 per cent of new board positions were held by women. Seven out of 10 federal
    and state parliamentarians are men â\x80\x93 a ratio that hasnâ\x80\x99t changed
    in 10 years. Men receive twice the number of awards and nominations than women
    for an Order of Australia, and female chief executives in the top 200 ASX listed
    companies remain below 5 per cent.\r\n\r\nWhat those statistics donâ\x80\x99t
    show, however, is that Melbourne is teeming with fabulous, accomplished women,
    achieving great things in fields as diverse as arts, politics, fashion and social
    justice.\r\n\r\nHere are some of our cityâ\x80\x99s most inspiring examples.\r\n\r\n**JULIA
    GILLARD**\r\n\r\nï¿¼Whether youâ\x80\x99re a fan or not, Julia Gillardâ\x80\x99s
    mantle as one of the most powerful women in Australia is irrefutable. Australiaâ\x80\x99s
    first female prime minister has weathered more storms in her first term than any
    other PM in recent memory. Her unmarried and childless status has made her a target
    for those who want to paint her as uncaring or unable to understand family life.
    But she has managed to do what Kevin Rudd couldnâ\x80\x99t â\x80\x93 successfully
    push through reforms on the mining and carbon taxes and introduce a national disability
    insurance scheme that will improve the quality of life for hundreds of thousands
    of people.\r\n\r\nWhy sheâ\x80\x99s influential: For getting on with the job while
    those around her try to tear her down.\r\n\r\n**MARILYN WARREN**\r\n\r\nAs Chief
    Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria, the Honourable Marilyn Warren AC, QC,
    is a study in firsts â\x80\x93 the first female Chief Justice of any state or
    territory in Australia and the first female articled clerk in public service in
    Victoria. Her achievements are numerous, among them being Lieutenant Governor
    of Victoria and chairwoman of the Judicial College of Victoria. In December she
    spoke out ins support of the legal aid system, arguing that the right to a fair
    trial was in jeopardy because of increaseing demand and insufficient funding.\r\n\r\nWhy
    sheâ\x80\x99s influential: She didnâ\x80\x99t just break through the glass ceiling,
    she smashed it.\r\n\r\n**LESLIE CANNOLD**\r\n\r\nBorn and raised in the US, Leslie
    Cannold is recognised as one of Australiaâ\x80\x99s leading thinkers, feminists
    and ethicists. A vocal supporter of the pro-choice movement, Cannold offers considered,
    thought-provoking insights into seemingly complicated issues and has won applause
    for her work on gender discrimination and challenging the work/life balance. In
    2011, Cannold was named the Australian Humanist of the Year, and continues her
    work to fight for womenâ\x80\x99s right to control their own bodies.\r\n\r\nWhy
    sheâ\x80\x99s influential: For providing smart, considered ideas about society.\r\n\r\n**ANN
    PEACOCK**\r\n\r\nBorn into influence, the daughter of former Liberal leader Andrew
    Peacock and socialite Lady Susan Renouf, has become a leader of Melbourneâ\x80\x99s
    society set in her own right. As manager of public relations at Crown Casino,
    Peacock has a little black address booked filled with the names and numbers of
    the most powerful people across all fields â\x80\x93 politics, arts and entertainment,
    sports and business. She uses her power for good as a charity fund-raiser, and
    is the driving force behind the Million Dollar Lunch, an annual event that raises
    money for children with cancer.\r\n\r\nWhy sheâ\x80\x99s influential: Because
    anyone will answer her phone call.\r\n\r\n**LOUISE ASHER**\r\n\r\nAlthough she
    has kept a low profile since the Coalition came to power in 2010, Asher is a powerful
    behind-the-scenes player in state politics and is considered by many to be a grounding
    force in the Liberal Party. One of the few women selected for the male-dominated
    frontbench, Asher is deputy leader of the Liberal Party and the minister for the
    major portfolios of innovation, services and small business, and tourism and major
    events, the latter being something most Victorians have an interest in.\r\n\r\nWhy
    sheâ\x80\x99s influential: For advocating for more women to get into politics.\r\n\r\n**CATHERINE
    DEVENY**\r\n\r\nA controversial thought-provoker, the ever quotable Catherine
    Deveny gets people talking, whether itâ\x80\x99s about feminism, cycling, love
    or social equality. A writer, comedian and social commentator, Deveny rejects
    the idea that women need to behave a certain way. In the process, she has influenced
    a whole generation of women not content to play along with traditional roles society
    maps out for them.\r\n\r\nWhy sheâ\x80\x99s influential: She gets people thinking
    about challenging the status quo.\r\n\r\n**NAOMI MILGROM**\r\n\r\nThe notoriously
    media-shy Naomi Milgrom is a stand-out success story in business and the arts.
    As chief executive and chairwoman of the Sussan Group, which owns Sportsgirl,
    Sussan and Suzanne Grae, Milgrom has been credited with developing a business
    in an industry known for its fickleness and vulnerability to economic cycles.
    As head of Australiaâ\x80\x99s biggest privately held specialty fashion retailer,
    Milgrom has been lauded as one of the top 25 business leaders in the country.
    Her success isnâ\x80\x99t confined to one field: Milgrom is president of the National
    Gallery of Victoria and in 2010 was awarded an Officer of the Order of Australia
    for her contribution to business and the arts.\r\n\r\nWhy sheâ\x80\x99s influential:
    Sheâ\x80\x99s played the game by her own rules and won, convincingly.\r\n\r\n**JOSIE
    TAYLOR**\r\n\r\nOne of the stand-out stars at the ABC, Josie Taylor is an award-winning
    journalist with current affairs program 7.30. Sheâ\x80\x99s behind some of the
    biggest Victorian scoops of the past five years, including the Windsor Hotel scandal
    and underworld crime stories. Before joining the rejuvenated 7.30, Taylor held
    other senior ABC positions including state political reporter for ABC TV, working
    on AM, PM and The World Today, and as associate producer on Insiders.\r\n\r\nWhy
    sheâ\x80\x99s influential: Proving that female reporters can cover stories that
    donâ\x80\x99t involve fluffy animals or celebrities.\r\n\r\n**SAMAH HADID**\r\n\r\nAt
    just 26, Samah Hadid has lived a full life, much of it spent helping the worldâ\x80\x99s
    most disadvantaged and misunderstood people. Samah speaks out on\r\nMuslim stereotypes,
    publicly supports gay rights and advocates for womenâ\x80\x99s rights. The social
    justice campaigner is also the Australian director of the Global Poverty Project
    and advises governments and organisations on ending extreme poverty and improving
    human rights. In her spare time sheâ\x80\x99s a performer and playwright, because
    saving the world isnâ\x80\x99t enough work.\r\n\r\nWhy sheâ\x80\x99s influential:
    For wanting to make a difference and actually doing it."
