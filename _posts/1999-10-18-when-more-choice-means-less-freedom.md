    woman knows that children scuttle careers. It starts with\r\npregnancy and the
    salary rise and promotions that never come. Then on to\r\nmaternity leave, rarely
    paid, usually begrudged; that is, if there are\r\nno plots to restructure your
    job out of existence in your absence. The\r\nunreliability of nannies (yours had
    to be the only one who didnâ\x80\x99t have\r\nchicken pox as a child) and the
    restricted hours of centre-based care\r\nmake you inflexible enough to be passed
    over for interesting and/or\r\ncareer-building assignments due to a lack of \\`\\`seriousnessâ\x80\x98â\x80\x99
    and\r\n\\`\\`commitmentâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99.\r\n\r\nBut wait. Can it be that science
    has contrived to rid women of the\r\ninsistent and inflexible demands of their
    biological clocks? Hang on to\r\nyour ovarian tissue, girls, because now, at the
    IVF clinic nearest you,\r\nitâ\x80\x99s tissue-banking time.\r\n\r\nJust pop into
    your nearest IVF clinic, bank your twentysomething ovarian\r\ntissue - brim full
    with fresh young eggs - and get back to work\r\nconfident that your fertility
    is just a regraft away. Now you too can\r\nwork like the boys. Into the night.
    Weekends. Get flown overseas with\r\njust a momentâ\x80\x99s notice. And with
    no interruptions for childbearing and\r\nrearing, and no children to temper your
    zealous devotion to the job,\r\nthereâ\x80\x99s nothing to stop you maintaining
    the pace for years.\r\n\r\nWhat did you say? The freezing and regrafting procedure
    isnâ\x80\x99t that easy?\r\nLots of eggs are lost in the removal, freezing, thawing
    and grafting\r\nprocedures? Nasty adhesions around the ovaries may prevent natural\r\nconception
    even if the re-grafted tissue works perfectly?\r\n\r\nAnd whatâ\x80\x99s this
    about the unknown long-term health risks of the\r\nsuper-ovulation and hormonal
    stimulation - and the added time it takes\r\nto actually get a bub in the hand
    - should an IVF conception eventually\r\nbe required? And then problems with mature-age
    motherhood? Not as easy\r\nto gestate the little mites when older what with the
    gestational\r\ndiabetes and blood pressure problems that often dog older-age\r\npregnancies.
    Not to mention the sheer exhaustion experienced by older\r\nmothers carting the
    little ones about, and getting up several times in\r\nthe night to feed them.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, infertility specialists are likely to overcome some, if not\r\nall, of
    these glitches by the time women now in their 20s are ready to\r\nre-embrace their
    fertility. Ways around operative and re-operative\r\nadhesions, extensions to
    the shelf life of grafts in older women, and\r\neven counters to the age-related
    pregnancy problems and exhaustion\r\nexperienced by older mothers are all future
    possibilities.\r\n\r\nFor women, the real problems with tissue banking may be
    social, not\r\nmedical. Problems closely associated with the pervasive assumption
    that\r\nsuch technologies always give women greater choice and freedom, with\r\nthose
    who donâ\x80\x99t want to participate free to opt out. In fact, while such\r\ntechnologies
    expand some womenâ\x80\x99s choices, they may severely restrict the\r\nfreedoms
    of others.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon is not new. Writing about his experience in
    an IVF\r\nprogram, academic Paul Lauritzen describes the mere availability of\r\nreproductive
    technologies as tyrannical and coercive. The existence of\r\nmultiple treatment
    options for his retrograde ejaculation turned his\r\ninfertility from a fact of
    life for which he was blameless to a choice\r\nto be childless for which he was
    responsible.\r\n\r\nFrozen ovarian tissue grafts will expand some womenâ\x80\x99s
    reproductive\r\nfreedom, but at the cost of contracting the freedom of other women
    to\r\nchoose. Women who truly want to go full bore at work until they hit\r\nmenopause,
    then have children later in life, now have that option. But\r\nwomen who prefer
    to avoid the invasiveness and uncertainty connected\r\nwith this new medical procedure,
    not to mention physical and social\r\nstresses associated with older motherhood,
    may be out of luck.\r\n\r\nStripped of their reproductive inevitabilities, women
    who leave the\r\nworkforce to have kids at what their bosses deem inopportune
    times will\r\nbe seen to have chosen such timing, and consequently be held responsible\r\nfor
    any resulting inconveniences to the company and co-workers.\r\n\r\nWomen who \\`\\`chooseâ\x80\x99â\x80\x99
    to have children while still young may be held\r\nsolely and fully responsible
    for any downslide in their work prospects\r\nduring pregnancy and when they return
    from maternity leave. After all,\r\nthey could have chosen to have children at
    the endpoint, rather than the\r\nhighpoint, of their careers.\r\n\r\nMaternity
    leave, too, may become a thing of the past. Women who choose\r\nto have children
    while still in the workforce, the argument might run,\r\nmust take full responsibility
    for the career and financial costs\r\nassociated with this choice.\r\n\r\nSo young
    lady, get ye to a tissue bank. Or perhaps your union, lawyerâ\x80\x99s\r\noffice
    or nearest womenâ\x80\x99s group. Because, if women ever had the freedom,\r\nhowever
    vague and unvoiced, to conceive children unassisted and when\r\nthey were young,
    they may be about to lose it.\r\n\r\nIn the future, all women may need an as-yet-unwritten
    clause in their\r\nawards or individual employment contracts - a clause that gives
    them the\r\nright to have children naturally, and at the time of their choosing,\r\ndespite
    the scientific possibility to do otherwise."
