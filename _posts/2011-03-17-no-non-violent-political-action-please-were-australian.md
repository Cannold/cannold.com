    Lyrics from â\x80\x9CB Movieâ\x80\x9D by Gil Scott-Heron.\r\n\r\nOver the long
    weekend just past, there were several breakouts\r\nfrom the Christmas Island detention
    centre. Also, a 300 strong protest\r\nthat officials said was a riot and quelled
    with beanbag rounds. Laborâ\x80\x99s\r\nImmigration Minister Chris Bowen accused
    some of the asylum seekers of\r\nwaging an â\x80\x9Corchestrated campaign.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nChristmas
    Island Shire President Gordon Thompson, speaking on ABC radio,\r\nagreed. He said
    the detainees on Christmas Island had set out â\x80\x9Cto make a\r\npeaceful protest,â\x80\x9D
    going â\x80\x9Cinto the community to be seen and to be\r\nheardâ\x80\x9D. Their
    purpose? To â\x80\x9Cdraw media attention to their plight.â\x80\x9D A\r\nplight
    that, according to refugee advocates, includes severe\r\novercrowding at the facility
    (built for 500 people, it now houses more\r\nthan 2,500) and extended delays in
    visas, including those already deemed\r\nrefugees.\r\n\r\nThe Shire President
    went on to say that having met with the asylum\r\nseekers, his impression was
    that â\x80\x9Ca fairly strategic approach was taken\r\nto protests.â\x80\x9D He
    continued. â\x80\x9CThese people have come here with the\r\npurpose of getting
    a visaâ\x80¦ Theyâ\x80\x99re forging a path for their families to\r\nfollowâ\x80¦
    The primary motivation of the protests is to get attention to\r\ntheir plight
    and to have their situation resolved one way or another.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nLike
    many Australians, I have been following the national debate about\r\nasylum-seekers
    arriving by boat since it became a partisan issue during\r\nthe Howard years.
    I remember well the dead-fish tones of then\r\nImmigration Minister Phillip Ruddock
    insinuating that all attempts by\r\nrefugees to achieve a â\x80\x9Cdesired migration
    outcomeâ\x80\x9D were - and should\r\nrightly be viewed by the community - as
    manipulative of our emotions,\r\nAustralian law, or both.\r\n\r\nWe saw this back
    in 2000 when senior government ministers including\r\nRuddock and Prime Minister
    John Howard said that asylum seekers had\r\nthrown their children overboard, claims
    that would later be shown to be\r\nfalse - and to have been known to be false
    by those making them.\r\n\r\nThe intent of the charges seemed be to undermine
    the character of boat\r\npeople. What sort of human beings would throw their own
    children\r\noverboard at all, little less for the purpose of manipulating the
    good\r\nnature of Australians, and our soft-hearted laws, to achieve a migration\r\noutcome?
    Ruddock called it â\x80\x9Cone of the most disturbing incidents heâ\x80\x99d\r\nheard
    of in his public lifeâ\x80\x9D while Howard said, â\x80\x9CI certainly donâ\x80\x99t
    want\r\npeople of that type in Australia, I really donâ\x80\x99t.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nFor
    both men, and the audiences to which they were playing, the attempt\r\nby asylum
    seekers to incite our sympathy invalidated their claim to it.\r\nTo the contrary,
    we were entitled to feel aggrieved by their overtures\r\nand to draw negative
    inferences about the characters of those who would\r\nâ\x80\x9Ctry it onâ\x80\x9D
    in such a way. Peter Mares traces this attitude back to the\r\nlate 19th century
    when the growth of Chinaâ\x80\x99s population led some\r\nAustralians to argue
    we were at risk of being overrun by more\r\nâ\x80\x9Ccalculating and ruthless
    Asians.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nAll this is confusing to those who are across the theory
    of non-violent\r\naction, which includes passive resistance, peaceful demonstrations,\r\npetitions
    and boycotts. All non-aggressive physical methods aimed at\r\nawakening moral
    conscience in observers and - to paraphrase Martin\r\nLuther King Jr - persuading
    the opponent of the justice of your case.\r\n\r\nOdder still is our enthusiasm
    for such methods when used by those on\r\nforeign soil. From Gandhi to the students
    in Tiananmen Square to\r\norganizers of recent uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt and
    Libya, Australians\r\nhave supported disciplined concerted non-violent political
    action to\r\ndraw the eyes of the world to those with a political cause, and spark
    an\r\nimpulse to help.\r\n\r\nSo why when the orchestrated campaign is in our
    own backyard do we\r\nbaulk? Is it simply resistance to the terrible truth that
    sometimes we\r\nare not the freedom-seekers but the oppressors? Is it as Gil Scott-Heron\r\nsuggests,
    that we talk a good game about freedom and democracy but are\r\nin fact anxious
    about the rapid flowering of a world in which everyone\r\nwants freedom and knows
    how to get it."
