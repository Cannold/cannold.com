    make\r\nthem admirable.\r\n\r\nTHE canonisation of Saint Monica has begun. Before
    our very eyes the\r\nmedia is transforming Lewinsky from a dumb-assed slut to
    an admirable\r\nyoung woman. Sheâ\x80\x99s tamed her white-trash haircut and thrown
    away her\r\nbaseball cap. Sheâ\x80\x99s donned cheekbones and a dignified navy
    suit. Sheâ\x80\x99s\r\nlearnt her lesson. Sheâ\x80\x99s showed him! Why, sheâ\x80\x99s
    turned out to be quite a\r\nremarkable young lady.\r\n\r\nI donâ\x80\x99t wish
    to be mean when it comes to Lewinsky. Thereâ\x80\x99s no doubt\r\nsheâ\x80\x99s
    been through a lot. I mean, I would rather die than have the\r\nidiotic things
    I said and did in my early 20s - sexual and otherwise -\r\nbroadcast to TV audiences
    worldwide in choice snippets and available\r\nverbatim to every geek with a computer.
    And I know sheâ\x80\x99s in debt, and\r\nIâ\x80\x99m truly glad to see sheâ\x80\x99s
    managed to impress the newspapers and\r\ncommentators she so desperately needs
    to sell the book, to make the\r\nmillions, to pay the lawyers, to clean up the
    mess Bill and Monica made.\r\n\r\nBut I donâ\x80\x99t like being asked to admire
    Lewinsky, even though being born\r\nand raised in America gives me an unpleasant
    clarity about why the\r\nAmerican media and public, having spent most of last
    year eating her for\r\nbreakfast, are this year happy to orchestrate her rehabilitation.
    Itâ\x80\x99s a\r\npenchant for tell-all confessions followed by true-grit struggle
    and\r\nredemption, plus a healthy dollop of guilt, that has got Americans\r\nworking
    their way towards a love of Monica that rivals their love of\r\nPrincess Di. And
    the parallel is not incidental.\r\n\r\nOne long afternoon in front of the tube
    is testimony aplenty to the\r\nAmerican love for public confession. Whether it
    be about goats and\r\ngrandmothers, or daughters who sleep with their similarly
    aged\r\nstep-fathers, there is little Americans wonâ\x80\x99t divulge for Oprah
    or an\r\nOprah-substitute, a live audience and a camera that broadcasts to the\r\nglobal
    millions at home.\r\n\r\nBut simply â\x80\x9Cletting it outâ\x80\x9D is no longer
    the name of the game. After the\r\nsuccessful reactionary and society-wide assault
    on â\x80\x9Cvictimhoodâ\x80\x9D and the\r\nâ\x80\x9Cculture of complaintâ\x80\x9D,
    Oprah now articulates Americaâ\x80\x99s new focus on\r\nmoving women past the
    â\x80\x9Cwhiningâ\x80\x9D stage. â\x80\x9CLet it out and do something\r\nabout
    it,â\x80\x9D she now coaches. â\x80\x9COr shut up.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nAnd Monica
    has done just that. Sheâ\x80\x99s stopped whining, stopped shopping\r\nand stopped
    looking like she canâ\x80\x99t stop eating. And thereâ\x80\x99s nothing\r\nAmericans
    like more than a success story, although their standards for\r\nsuccess remain
    tragically low: be thin, be rich and be famous.\r\n\r\nNow if that formula sounds
    depressingly like the one that endeared\r\nPrincess Diana to the Americans, hereâ\x80\x99s
    another important similarity in\r\nboth womenâ\x80\x99s self-promotion strategies.
    Both Monica and Di â\x80\x9Cmade itâ\x80\x9D in\r\nthat quintessentially female
    way - through their relationships with men.\r\nRelationships in which they stood
    by their men until they were so hurt,\r\nso tragically wronged, that they had
    to let it out. â\x80\x9CI see myself in a\r\nsimilar situation (to Diana),â\x80\x9D
    Lewinsky revealed in a recent interview.\r\nâ\x80\x9CI was also wronged by a man
    who said he loved me.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nAnd let it out they did, in surprisingly
    similar ways. In â\x80\x9Crevelatoryâ\x80\x9D\r\ninterviews in which every question
    was known and every response and\r\nfacial gesture scripted. Interviews in which
    tears and despair were\r\nimportantly paired - not with bitterness but with a
    stoic determination\r\nto survive.\r\n\r\nOK, so thatâ\x80\x99s the name of the
    game, and sheâ\x80\x99s playing it. But admire\r\nher? Feel for her, maybe. Want
    it to work out for her in the end, OK.\r\nAfter all, sheâ\x80\x99s been through
    the spin cycle of the well-practised\r\npresidential bimbo-control machine and,
    as Iâ\x80\x99m sure Gennifer Flowers,\r\nPaula Jones, Kathleen Willey and Juanita
    Broaddrick would testify, this\r\nis not a particularly self-affirming experience.\r\n\r\nBut
    if Americans feel guilty about whatâ\x80\x99s happened to Monica (and what\r\nhasnâ\x80\x99t
    happened to Bill) as a result of their dalliance, they should\r\nstop looking
    the other way each time another woman tied up with Clinton\r\nreveals not just
    how trying he finds keeping his pecker in his pants,\r\nbut how difficult a time
    he has understanding the word â\x80\x9Cnoâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nBut spare me the spiel
    about her â\x80\x9Cself-awarenessâ\x80\x9D, her â\x80\x9Carticulatenessâ\x80\x9D,\r\nher
    â\x80\x9Cpoiseâ\x80\x9D and the â\x80\x9Cquick-wittedâ\x80\x9D way she ducks the
    questions of those\r\nbefore whom she has placed herself - dollar signs registering\r\nBugs-Bunny-like
    in both eyes.\r\n\r\nI would love a woman of my generation to be put in the media
    spotlight\r\nfor all to admire. Someone whose values and behavior somehow capture
    the\r\nessence and spirit of the women of Generation X as we face the\r\nmillennium.
    There are a number of high-quality candidates out there, but\r\nLewinsky isnâ\x80\x99t
    one."
