    jail for contempt of court. A former customs official is convicted for leaking
    reports about security breaches at Sydney Airport to the media. Allegations of
    undue interference in a police investigation of a young woman's rape by an AFL
    footballer are vindicated, but still no charges are laid.\n\nWhat holds these
    stories together? The answer is Australia's desultory, and at times plain dishonourable,
    response to corruption.\n\nCorruption rots trust and trust is the foundation for
    human and institutional relationships. If I invest my time and money in preparing
    myself to sit university entrance exams, it is because I trust that the exams
    will be fair and scored accurately, entrance will be based on them and grades
    within the hallowed halls will be distributed on merit, too.\n\nIf corruption
    corrodes any of these processes, I will have been cheated of what I worked hard
    to achieve and had a right to expect. Dudded, I will spread the word, and trust
    in the university system will dissolve. Some will respond by growing cynical and
    withdrawing. Others will pursue the prize of university entry by whatever means
    a corrupt system encourages, further entrenching foul play. No wonder Argentinian
    researchers have found that corruption leads to operational inefficiency, a less-favourable
    business climate and a drag on a nation's wealth.\n\nHands up if you've heard
    of investigative reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein? What about the Pentagon
    Papers' Daniel Ellsberg? These American justice-seekers should be household names,
    but how many of us know Australian equivalents?\n\nTake Nick McKenzie and Richard
    Baker. The award-winning reporters are fighting in the courts to maintain the
    confidentiality of a source in their long-running investigation of alleged corruption
    and a high-level cover-up by executives of money-printing companies overseen and
    at least part-owned by the Reserve Bank. Should they lose, both young men face
    up to two years in jail for contempt of court.\n\nDo you know about Allan Kessing,
    a former Australian Customs official? Kessing was successfully prosecuted for
    leaking to the media after the contents of two reports he'd conducted into security
    breaches at Sydney airport - and that his superior buried - appeared in the media.
    He is widely seen to have been vindicated by the multiple arrests of customs officials
    in a drug sting at the airport last year. Kessing denies the leaks.\n\nThen there's
    police whistleblowers Scott Gladman and Mike Smith. They went public with claims
    that interference in their investigation into 2004 rape allegations against AFL
    footballer Stephen Milne saw a case dropped that - to quote Gladman - ''should
    be answered by a jury''. Gladman's tale included being hounded and pressured by
    fellow members of the force to ''make it go away'' and being told the alleged
    victim was ''just one of those footy sluts''. He says player interview tapes were
    stolen from his desk.\n\nWhistleblowers want justice. They expose corruption in
    the sincere belief that once officialdom knows about the bad apples, they will
    vigorously pursue their eviction from the bunch.\n\nUnfortunately - and as these
    three cases show - what officialdom often does is scramble to bury the bodies
    while deploying all means at its disposal to shoot the messenger.\n\nFor instance,
    Australian agencies - including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission,
    the government and the Reserve Bank board - did nothing despite warnings and tipoffs
    associated with the RBA bribery scandal. While the Federal Police investigation
    was painfully slow, a series of charges were laid in 2011. Transparency International
    says inadequacies in Australia's legal framework and enforcement system are behind
    our failure to enforce foreign bribery laws.\n\nKessing's reports were buried
    by customs and, when their content went public, the federal government prosecuted
    to the full extent of the law, including pursuing a custodial sentence. Allegations
    that the AFP failed to pass on information critical to establishing Kessing's
    innocence has led to calls for an investigation of the case by the Australian
    Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. But despite ample evidence that Kessing's
    warnings about Sydney Airport security were accurate, the Gillard government won't
    pardon him.\n\nAnd what of the two coppers, now resigned from the force? They
    say they told senior officers in charge of the sexual crimes squad and assistant
    commissioner of the region about the problems but were met with indifference.
    Eventually, the Victorian Office of Police Integrity was called in but, despite
    concluding that Gladman's concerns about ''undue interference'' were ''reasonable'',
    Victoria Police has closed the door on the possibility of charges being laid.
    \n\nFeel a bit sick? Me too.\n\nImagine if we lived in a world where government
    and business leaders who now treat whistleblowers like they are the criminals
    dedicated their energies to listening to them, and fixing the problems they describe
    instead.\n\nWhat if Australia celebrated an ''Integrity Day'' holiday each year,
    where the brave and principled - journalists, public servants, business folk -
    were honoured for sacrifices they made to bring matters that put what we value
    at risk to light? \n\nImagine that."
