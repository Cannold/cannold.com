  content: "Leslie joins Jane Caro and Natasha Stott-Despoja among others in considering
    the take-aways from Julia Gillard's tenure as Australia's first female PM and
    suggesting ways forward for the next generation of women leaders. \r\n\r\nLeslie's
    contribution is here: \r\n\r\n1. Australiaâ\x80\x99s first female prime minister,
    Julia Gillard said that she was aware of the misogyny around her leadership, which
    included comments in the media, derogatory doctored images and an infamous sexist
    menu, but chose not to focus on it. Should Australiaâ\x80\x99s future female PM:\r\n\r\na)
    Focus or ignore sexism around her leadership?\r\nb) Take action as soon as it
    happens?\r\nc) Take action at some later stage during her term?\r\nd) What type
    of action shod she take to address the sexism?\r\n\r\nIâ\x80\x99m a researcher,
    so my first response to this question is, â\x80\x9Cwhat do we know works?â\x80\x9D
    If we want to stop sexism â\x80\x93 and thatâ\x80\x99s my aim â\x80\x93 what would
    be the most effective strategy for someone high profile who is constantly in the
    media spotlight? How might this differ from the most effective strategy an advocacy
    group might use?\r\nI went to the academic literature to try and answer this question
    and came up with nothing. Nada. Academics have done a good job documenting the
    various manifestations of sexism faced by women leaders. There seems to be less
    systemic exploration of the effectiveness of varied strategies to address it.
    This relegates my response to this question to the realm of opinion â\x80\x90
    youâ\x80\x99ve been warned.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, the trap for all those naming
    oppression, not just sexism but racism or discrimination against those with disabilities,
    is that they are viewed as whingers, excuseâ\x80\x90makers or otherâ\x80\x90blamers.
    Itâ\x80\x99s one thing for an advocacy group representing womenâ\x80\x99s interests
    to name and shame the sexism faced by other women, including the PM. This work
    is important and necessary and I absolutely support it. Whether we like it or
    not, the impact of someone who constantly in the spotlight (like a PM) speaking
    up about her own oppression reads differently and a minefield for all the reasons
    we saw play out for Gillard when the misogyny speech went viral. And my interest
    is what can and should be done to effectively challenge and eliminate sexism.\r\n\r\nNo
    form of oppression or discrimination should be ignored. Sexism must be named and
    condemned. However, the most effective means for a PM to do this may be to have
    others call it out for her.\r\n\r\n2. Should Australiaâ\x80\x99s future female
    PM be concerned:\r\n\r\na) About using the gender card If she complains about
    sexism and misogyny that she might experience:\r\nb) That gender might be a dominant
    factor in how she is treated as a Prime Minister\r\n\r\nJulia Gillard was Australiaâ\x80\x99s
    only female Prime Minister. Relying on this (unreliable) sample of one we can
    conclude that the answer to a) is yes. Staring warily at the word â\x80\x9Cdominantâ\x80\x99,
    my answer to b) is a more qualified yes. On the question of whether gender will
    factor into the treatment of a future PM, Gillardâ\x80\x99s own assessment of
    how it impacted her journey summarises my prediction best. She said that it didnâ\x80\x99t
    explain everything but it didnâ\x80\x99t explain nothing.\r\n\r\n3. Should Australiaâ\x80\x99s
    future female PM:\r\n\r\na) Deflect that she is a woman and neutralise the issue
    of her gender:\r\nb) Confront gendered expectations of how she should be in public
    and in private\r\nc) Be herself\r\nd) Govern as a man would.\r\n\r\nEveryone wants
    a world in which we are all free to be ourselves and to be recognised and respected
    for who we are. We all want to be judged for the content of our character, not
    the colour of our skin or the tackle we have in our drawers. I want this for myself,
    my children and the next female PM.\r\nWe must keep working towards this sort
    of world at the same time as we acknowledge it doesnâ\x80\x99t currently exist.
    Because it doesnâ\x80\x99t currently exist, women will â\x80\x93 and must â\x80\x90
    look for practical means of reducing the insidiousness of sexism on their careers
    and leadership prospects.\r\n\r\nFor years, the wisdom was that women earn less
    than men because, unlike men, they donâ\x80\x99t negotiate their starting salaries.
    New research shows that in fact the situation is more complex. It reveals that
    where a womanâ\x80\x99s negotiating partner is male, any attempt to negotiate
    her first salary will be marked down by him in a way different to a male candidate
    and she wonâ\x80\x99t get the job. The upshot may be that women donâ\x80\x99t
    negotiate their salaries in the same way as men because â\x80\x93 unlike men â\x80\x93
    they will be marked down for it.\r\n\r\nIs this fair? Absolutely not. Is this
    the current and unfortunate reality? Seems so. What should a woman do in response
    to this reality? Be herself and lose the job if being herself is asking for the
    higher salary? Or should she not negotiate a better starting salary so as to avoid
    being (unfairly) disadvantaged? It requires the wisdom of Solomon to determine
    which choice is â\x80\x9Crightâ\x80\x9D but I wonâ\x80\x99t be throwing stones
    whatever choice a woman makes. And I donâ\x80\x99t think anyone else should be
    lobbying them either.\r\n\r\nChanging the invidious choices women face in a sexist
    society requires large scale social movements and social change. It wonâ\x80\x99t
    changed by praising or blaming individual women, including Australiaâ\x80\x99s
    next female PM.*\r\n\r\n4. How has PM Gillard made it easier for the next woman
    to be Australiaâ\x80\x99s female PM?\r\nSimply by being the first. If still exists
    in Australia when we have another female PM she will cop some of it, but at least
    the novelty factor will have worn off. Victoriaâ\x80\x99s first and only female
    Premier\r\n\r\nJoan Kirner has said that the reason the cartoonist who kept drawing
    her in a polka dot dress â\x80\x93 a dress she did not possess â\x80\x93 was that
    he didnâ\x80\x99t know how a woman in power should be drawn. Hopefully, the parallel
    uncertainties felt by similar such men running the joint will be cleared up by
    the time another woman takes the helm and that woman can get on with the job of
    being PM without the distraction such male uncertainties â\x80\x93 or is that
    insecurities â\x80\x93 cause.\r\n\r\n5. When do you think it is likely that that
    Australia will have a female PM?\r\n\r\nNot sure when, but it will happen. Certainly
    not any later than it takes for the young people who came of age during Gillardâ\x80\x99s
    tenure to become the prime movers and shakers in this country. For these young
    people, Gillard would have normalized the look, feel and sound of a woman in power.
    This should mean that the next time an appealing candidate for PM comes along
    who just happens to be a woman, theyâ\x80\x99ll feel able to vote for her without
    a backwards glance."

title: Leslie' Advice to Australia's Next Female PM
--- "Leslie joins Jane Caro and Natasha Stott-Despoja among others in considering
  the take-aways from Julia Gillard's tenure as Australia's first female PM and suggesting
  ways forward for the next generation of women leaders. \r\n\r\nLeslie's contribution
  is here: \r\n\r\n1. Australiaâ\x80\x99s first female prime minister, Julia Gillard
