  content: "Itâ\x80\x99s the end of the footy season, so everyoneâ\x80\x99s talking
    about rape. Or,\r\nmore specifically, about the young women who were so stupid
    as to put\r\nthemselves in a position where theyâ\x80\x99d be raped, or be able
    to claim\r\nlater that they were.\r\n\r\nTV presenter Kerri-Anne Kennerley laid
    the blame on the â\x80\x9Cstraysâ\x80\x9D who\r\nâ\x80\x9Cthrow . . . themselves
    at sportspeopleâ\x80\x9D. â\x80\x9CWhat do [women] expect,â\x80\x9D she\r\nasked,
    â\x80\x9Cwhen they are out at night?â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nFormer AFL player Spida Everitt
    was also scathing about, â\x80\x9CYet another .\r\n. . girl making alleged allegations
    after she awoke with . . . an\r\nalleged guilty conscience.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nI
    have been raped. Twice. The first time was my first time - I was 17 -\r\nbut I
    didnâ\x80\x99t think of it as rape. Not even when the nightmares began\r\nand,
    following that, the depression.\r\n\r\nI just thought I was a stupid girl who
    put myself in harmâ\x80\x99s way and got\r\nwhat I deserved. Embarrassed at being
    so dumb, I told no one what\r\nhappened. It was only years later when I stubbed
    my toe and couldnâ\x80\x99t\r\nstop crying that my mother strong-armed me into
    seeing a psychologist\r\nand the story came out.\r\n\r\nThe second time was when
    an old boyfriend got my half-asleep roommate to\r\nlet him into the house in the
    middle of the night. I was in my room and\r\nwoke having sex. Surely this was
    a clear-cut case of rape but, again, I\r\ndidnâ\x80\x99t see it that way. Because
    now I was 21 and understood that you\r\ncanâ\x80\x99t thread a moving needle and
    Iâ\x80\x99d had sex with him before so what was\r\nthe big deal and if I hadnâ\x80\x99t
    wanted it why didnâ\x80\x99t I scream?\r\n\r\nIn fact, what I did - then and later
    - was pretend everything was fine.\r\nI acted like what happened was exactly what
    I chose to happen. I was not\r\nprepared to contemplate the alternative framing
    of events and its\r\nemotional corollary - that Iâ\x80\x99d been raped again and
    this meant that I\r\nwasnâ\x80\x99t safe anywhere, not even in my own bed.\r\n\r\nI
    donâ\x80\x99t want pity. Indeed, itâ\x80\x99s fear of being seen as a victim that
    has\r\nled me to keep my personal story quiet thus far. I tell it now to try to\r\ninject
    the complex reality of sexual assault - how it happens and how\r\nthose who experience
    it attempt to get their heads around it - into the\r\npublic discussions we have
    most years at this time on the subject.\r\n\r\nI also want to point to the contribution
    gender stereotypes make to the\r\nproblem. Like young women today, I was sold
    a double message. The\r\nexplicit one was that I was strong, capable and free
    to do what I chose\r\nwith my life and body - sexually and otherwise - and not
    be judged for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe subterranean one was that if I acted as if I was
    entitled to be both\r\nfree and safe, and someone did hurt or rape me, it was
    my own stupid,\r\nsluttish fault.\r\n\r\nThese contradictory messages have co-existed
    quietly in my psyche just\r\nas they do for some young women today until the Kennerleys
    and Everitts\r\nof the world lay them bare.\r\n\r\nI laid my own demons to rest
    long ago. One thing that helped was the\r\nacknowledgment by one of the men that
    something bad had happened and it\r\nwasnâ\x80\x99t my fault. This was several
    years later and we were at a party. He\r\nfound me alone on the balcony and said
    this: â\x80\x9CWhat happened . . . that\r\nnight. I didnâ\x80\x99t realise then
    but I do now. It wasnâ\x80\x99t right. I shouldnâ\x80\x99t\r\nhave done it.â\x80\x9D
    I forgave him right then and there.\r\n\r\nSo where to now? Has increasing social
    and sexual freedom been good for\r\nyoung women, or bad? The truth is that this
    is the wrong question to\r\nask. Equality and freedom are chances that some women
    will use poorly\r\nand others well. Certainly every young woman, like every young
    man, will\r\nmake mistakes and get hurt. This is what coming of age is all about.
    The\r\nhope is that as time moves on, and a critical number of generations\r\naccumulate
    wisdom they can pass to their kids, the relative balance of\r\nthose who use their
    freedom wisely will grow.\r\n\r\nFor thousands of years, humans have lived in
    societies built on the\r\nexercise of superior male strength and the inevitability
    of female\r\npregnancy. Inflexible and gender-inequitable rules for emotional
    and\r\nphysical engagement between the sexes arose from these realities.\r\n\r\nAs
    societies governed by the rule of law and populated by women with\r\naccess to
    reliable contraception become the norm, new rules of\r\nengagement for relations
    between the sexes - ones based on mutual\r\nunderstanding, respect and consent
    - will flourish.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that young men are changing. Many see
    women as their\r\nequals, are well across the concept of consent and - in response
    to the\r\nmore assertive sexuality of their female peers - are interrogating the\r\nâ\x80\x9Creal
    men always want itâ\x80\x9D stereotype as a first step towards a â\x80\x9Cno means\r\nnoâ\x80\x9D
    mantra of their own.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, we must recognise young women who report
    sexual assault as\r\ncanaries in the coalmine. It is they who are blazing the
    trail towards\r\nthe safe and equal world we want for our daughters and sons.
    This is\r\nbecause, unlike me at that age, they donâ\x80\x99t have the words of
    Kennerley\r\nor Everitt in their head.\r\n\r\nInstead, they believe that, just
    like their male mates, they should be\r\nfree to party with abandon when their
    team wins the grand final. And be\r\nsafe while they do it."
