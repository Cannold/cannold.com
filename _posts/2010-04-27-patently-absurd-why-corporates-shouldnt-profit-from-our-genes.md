  content: "*How can human attributes be deemed corporate property?*\r\n\r\nWe tend
    to think of patents as good, or at least necessary, legal\r\ntools. Patents provide
    legal protection for innovations on which\r\ninventors rely to recoup the investment
    of time and money they made to\r\ndevelop a new medication, or bring a product
    to market.\r\n\r\nBut where wrongly applied, patents can stifle innovation, drive
    up costs\r\nand restrict access to medicines and diagnostic tests. They can put\r\nlives
    at risk.\r\n\r\nPatents on genes do just that, yet the Australian government continues\r\nto
    grant them every year. To date, about 15,000 patents on human genes\r\nhave been
    granted around the world, including genes linked to cystic\r\nfibrosis, hearing
    loss, hereditary haemochromatosis, long QT syndrome,\r\nTay-Sachs and Alzheimerâ\x80\x99s
    disease.\r\n\r\nAmong the most high-profile victims of inappropriate patents are
    women\r\nat risk, or suffering from, hereditary breast or ovarian cancer. Myriad\r\nGenetics
    has patents on two of the genes that predict such cancers.\r\nTheir proprietary
    control means scientists must seek Myriadâ\x80\x99s permission\r\nto use the genes
    in studies designed to understand the cancers and to\r\ndevelop effective cures.
    Myriad has also used its monopolistic control\r\nto prevent women getting tested,
    to find out whether they carry the\r\ngene, in non-Myriad laboratories.\r\n\r\nIn
    America, this meant that sick women could either pay the companyâ\x80\x99s\r\nexorbitantly
    high fee for the test or go without.\r\n\r\nIn Australia, with our public health
    system, such extortionist tactics\r\ntarget the taxpayer. When Amgen had its 20-year
    patents on anaemia\r\ntreatment erythropoietin (EPO) extended by the Australian
    patent office\r\na few years back, $250 million was added to the public health
    bill. At\r\nleast the treatment remains available.\r\n\r\nAt the Westmead Childrenâ\x80\x99s
    Hospital in Sydney, doctors are prohibited by\r\na patent on the SCN1A gene from
    testing infants for epilepsy. This is\r\ndespite the fact that those babiesâ\x80\x99
    parents, and all other taxpayers,\r\nfunded the research that identified the gene
    in the first place.\r\n\r\nAmericans have had enough. In a landmark decision last
    month, a New York\r\ncourt ruled that patents for the genes associated with hereditary
    breast\r\nand ovarian cancer should never have been granted. The judge ruled that\r\ngenes
    are products of nature, not innovations that can or should be made\r\ncorporate
    property. Genes are part of all our bodies, the court noted,\r\ncontaining fundamental
    information about human life and health that\r\nshould be available to everyone,
    not locked up by private companies for\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nWhile Myriad intends
    to challenge the ruling in a case that seems\r\ndestined for the US Supreme Court,
    for the moment the Federal Court\r\njudgment is the law of the land. Until further
    notice, the US patent\r\noffice will not grant any further patents on human genes
    isolated from\r\nthe body, while those granted to date are now in jeopardy.\r\n\r\nAustralians
    are not so lucky, or at least not yet. The Senate recently\r\nconcluded a public
    consultation about the appropriate role of patents in\r\nregulating gene technology,
    but has yet to make recommendations. The\r\ninquiry looked at the impact of patents
    on the provision and costs of\r\nhealthcare, the training of healthcare providers,
    the progress of\r\nmedical research and the â\x80\x9Chealth and wellbeing of the
    Australian\r\npeopleâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nIts findings have been delayed due to the
    â\x80\x9Ccomplex nature of many issues\r\nassociated with this inquiryâ\x80\x9D
    (and, it is rumoured, the well-funded and\r\nvociferous lobbying efforts of biotechnology
    companies).\r\n\r\nAustralian legislators must also now be attentive to the US
    court\r\ndecision, as US and Australian patent laws are kissing cousins. This\r\nmeans
    that while the American decision is not binding on Australian\r\ncourts, it should
    have persuasive effect.\r\n\r\nAustralian supporters of present legal arrangements
    say that without\r\npatents, medical innovation will stop. Why should companies
    invest in\r\nresearch from which they cannot profit?\r\n\r\nIn a recent article
    in , Joseph Stiglitz and John Sulston - Nobel prize\r\nwinners in economics and
    medicine, respectively - argue that for science\r\nto progress, and medical care
    to improve, the knowledge derived from\r\ngenes must remain in the public domain,
    not locked up by patents. â\x80\x9CAs we\r\nmove into an era where the sequencing
    of all of an individualâ\x80\x99s genes is\r\ncommon and necessary for personalised
