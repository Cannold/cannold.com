    where a woman keeps her own name, does she follow tradition and give her offspring
    his surname instead of hers?\r\n\r\nOf course, all women have a right - when they
    marry and bear children - to decide as they like on such momentous matters. My
    interest is in why most women make this choice, with few even seeking to discuss
    it, little less cause a fight.\r\n\r\nIt's tradition for a bride to take her groom's
    surname and to give it to her kids. But given most of us know this tradition is
    grounded in sexist ideas about the property status of women, with marriage constituting
    a transfer of ownership from one male to another, I wonder why it's pervasive.\r\n\r\nMy
    observation as a woman who has kept her own name and given it to our children,
    is that men are more than aware of the privilege our naming traditions afford
    them. This is the case even for those who recognise that the tradition isn't fair.\r\n\r\nIn
    an admirably honest piece on the issue, married ''new-age'' father Clint Greagan
    says: ''[When] I think back to how we decided what name our children would adopt,
    [t]here really was no discussion about it. I was very adamant they'd be named
    after me and [my wife] was very quick to be OK with it â\x80¦ The main reason
    women take on their husband's surname â\x80¦ - tradition - is as warming in its
    origins as the tradition of slavery â\x80¦ I'd like to think that I'd be more
    open about our children's surnames [if we had our time again] but to be honest
    I would still struggle with it. I don't like that about myself.''\r\n\r\nGreagan's
    experience is that many men approach the child's surname issue in a way that suggests
    - and here I quote him again - ''there is no choice in the matter. Their wives
    and children will take their name - no hyphen, no name combinations, no discussion''.
    He thinks the problem is female and male socialisation, and I agree.\r\n\r\nWomen
    may roll over on the question of surnames to ensure their first decision in their
    new role of ''wife'' marks them as properly female. Indeed, the more publicly
    feminist a woman is, the more she may feel compelled to prove she is submissive
    in her private life.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, men need to prevail on this issue
    for fear of being viewed by others - particularly men - as ''Beta''. Ironically,
    it takes a secure male to disregard such peer pressure and decide the vexed question
    with his partner on the basis of negotiation between equals. In our case, such
    negotiation led to my surname being chosen, for reasons as diverse as its uniqueness
    and my Jewish ancestry.\r\n\r\nSometimes people express surprise when they realise
    my partner is not a Cannold, and yes the kids are his, but nothing that makes
    me feel they're checking to see if I own a pair. \r\n\r\nInstead, women seem to
    view our arrangement as confirmation of the authentic nature of my husband's feminism.
    Their partners' responses are even more telling. By lavishly praising my man's
    decision, they tacitly acknowledge a truth few care to admit openly.\r\n\r\nThat
    passing on one's name to a child is an enormous privilege that no one deserves
    to assume by right."
