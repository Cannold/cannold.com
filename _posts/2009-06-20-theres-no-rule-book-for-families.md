    play by the rule book â\x80¦ I hope this allows us to have a discussion\r\nabout
    how we balance these things and respect the work of working\r\nfamilies regardless
    of whether itâ\x80\x99s mothers or fathers â\x80¦â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThese are the
    words of freshman Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young,\r\ndescribing Thursdayâ\x80\x99s
    decision by Senate president John Hogg to evict\r\nher two-year-old daughter,
    Kora, from the chamber. The baby was a\r\nâ\x80\x9Cstranger in the houseâ\x80\x9D
    and, by Hoggâ\x80\x99s interpretation of ancient\r\nstanding orders, not allowed
    to be present during voting.\r\n\r\nHanson-Young was still upset when she made
    her comments, which may\r\naccount for their rawness and revelatory nature. I
    was intrigued by her\r\nuse of the word humiliation to describe how she felt,
    and gratified by\r\nher recognition of fathers as among the parents wanting a
    reasonable\r\nbalance between work and life.\r\n\r\nHumiliation is the loss of
    pride that brings one low or compels one to\r\nsubmit. It can be brought about
    through bullying, intimidation, physical\r\nor mental mistreatment, or by embarrassment
    if a person is presented as\r\nhaving committed a socially or legally unacceptable
    act.\r\n\r\nHumiliation, and its kissing cousin shame, play significant roles
    in\r\nshaping womenâ\x80\x99s experience of reproduction and motherhood.\r\n\r\nI
    was reminded of this recently by a friend who supported her\r\n18-year-old daughter
    through a second trimester abortion. For my friend,\r\nboth her daughterâ\x80\x99s
    denial of the reality of her pregnancy and the\r\npostures adopted by all the
    young women at the clinic, were portraits in\r\nfemale humiliation and shame.\r\n\r\nI
    wasnâ\x80\x99t sure I understood. â\x80\x9CHad the doctors said anything to the
    women?\r\nOr the medicos theyâ\x80\x99d encountered before getting to the clinic?â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CNo,
    Leslie,â\x80\x9D my friend replied. \"The shame was about being female. They\r\nwerenâ\x80\x99t
    supposed to be pregnant when they didnâ\x80\x99t want to be, and then\r\nthey
    were cramped and bleeding and leaking milk.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CThey feel out of control
    and vulnerable and dependent and thatâ\x80\x99s not\r\nhow anyone likes to feel,
    but these are modern girls, and so the whole\r\nthing made them feel like failures
    in the feminist sense, too. They were\r\n(she fished around for the right word)
    humiliated.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nHanson-Youngâ\x80\x99s humiliation had a similar texture.
    At the mercy of\r\nmotherhoodâ\x80\x99s vagaries, she was exposed before her peers
    as not being\r\nentirely in control and in charge of her fate. This would have\r\nundermined
    her claim to professionalism, a standard clearly not modelled\r\non anyone with
    family responsibilities, yet critical for anyone looking\r\nfor respect and new
    on the job.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways such humiliation can be managed. The first
    is for\r\nparents like Hanson-Young to cop it sweet. To see humiliation as just\r\ndeserts
    for their failure to, at all times and in all places, get the\r\nbalance between
    work and family right and, when it gets hard, to keep\r\ntheir struggles far from
    public view.\r\n\r\nThe second is to resist, to insist that the failure isnâ\x80\x99t
    with the\r\nhard-working, well-meaning and right-thinking young men and women
    who\r\nseek to combine paid work and active parenting, but with the rules that\r\nmake
    this so hard.\r\n\r\nAnd, having done this, to demand clearer and more flexible
    regulations\r\nthat account for the needs of parental parliamentarians.\r\n\r\nOn
    Monday, Greens leader Senator Bob Brown intends to do just this.\r\nBrown will
    pursue a motion of dissent with regard to Hoggâ\x80\x99s ruling, and\r\nadvance
    what he calls some â\x80\x9Cpost-horse-and-buggyâ\x80\x9D standing orders for\r\nthe
    Senate.\r\n\r\nIn Australia today, both the joys and humiliations of raising young\r\nchildren
    are largely the province of women. But it doesnâ\x80\x99t have to be\r\nthat way.
    By correcting her initial characterisation of the problem she\r\nfaced as that
    of a working mother to that of a working parent,\r\nHanson-Young contributed to
    the articulation of the work-life balance\r\nissue as one for both men and women
    who are parents now, or wish to be\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\nMen who share the
    work of earning and caring for children are the\r\nsolution to the work-family
    imbalance problem within Parliament and\r\nbeyond its hallowed halls. They ensure
    that the work-family imbalance is\r\nseen as a concern for everyone, and not just
    a humiliation that women\r\nmust endure and everyone else can ignore."
