    question\r\nin *My Fair Lady* and ever since Viagra began earning Pfizer more
    than\r\n$US1 billion ($1.2 billion) per year, the big pharmaceutical companies\r\nhave
    been asking it, too. Why canâ\x80\x99t womenâ\x80\x99s sexual problems be cured
    as\r\nsimply and profitably as menâ\x80\x99s?\r\n\r\nNow, Boehringer Ingelheim
    says it can. It claims that a new drug for\r\nwhich it is seeking approval from
    the US Food and Drug Administration,\r\nFlibanserin, improves hypoactive sexual
    desire disorder, or low libido.\r\nThe company says the condition affects one
    in 10 women.\r\n\r\nFlibanserin began life as an antidepressant but wasnâ\x80\x99t
    much chop. But\r\nduring its trials some women reported sexual benefits. Boehringer
    looked\r\nfurther. It now claims that 50 per cent of women with low desire who\r\ntake
    the pill for at least six months say their condition improved.\r\n\r\nThis outcome
    compares favourably with results reported for Europe, where\r\ntrials failed to
    show any statistically significant benefit for women\r\ntaking Flibanserin compared
    with a placebo.\r\n\r\nSo does the drug work? Who knows? All weâ\x80\x99ve got
    so far is Boehringerâ\x80\x99s\r\nclaims, which has only presented the contradictory
    findings of its\r\nstudies - ones it has funded and conducted itself - in the
    highly\r\nabbreviated form of conference abstracts. No independent evaluations
    of\r\neither the drugâ\x80\x99s safety or efficacy have been undertaken and no
    reports\r\nof the trials have appeared in journals. But the bigger problem with\r\nFlibanserin
    is that independent experts are unsure that the condition it\r\nclaims to treat
    - hypoactive sexual desire disorder - actually exists.\r\n\r\nMen want sex often
    and intensely. Barring erectile problems, their\r\ndesire leads to arousal and
    then to orgasm in a nice, linear fashion.\r\nWomenâ\x80\x99s sexual response -
    and Iâ\x80\x99m sure Iâ\x80\x99m not telling you anything here\r\nyou donâ\x80\x99t
    already know - is more complex.\r\n\r\nFor women, arousal may be necessary for
    desire but not sufficient.\r\nSometimes, women wonâ\x80\x99t want sex until theyâ\x80\x99ve
    started having it and many\r\nenjoy sex without orgasming. Being desired exclusively
    seems to be key\r\nto female libido, which may explain why relationships initially
    arouse\r\nwomen but cease to do so as time goes on. Indeed, while men tend to
    find\r\ntheir partners more desirable over time, women often need a new partner\r\nto
    rekindle desire.\r\n\r\nAll this raises the obvious question about whether low
    libido in women\r\nis pathological or just evidence that female sexuality is different
    to\r\nmenâ\x80\x99s? Indeed, even if we accept that marital disharmony resulting
    from\r\nmismatched desires for sex is a problem in need of address, is a pill\r\nreally
    the answer? And if it is, why medicate women? Why not give men a\r\ndrug to settle
    them down?\r\n\r\nThe reason seems to be that low libido, as well as other sexual\r\ndeficiencies,
    could be big business. If women can be convinced that a\r\npill will solve their
    problems by restoring what they have lost - the\r\nsuccessful paradigm behind
    the marketing of the change as an estrogen\r\ndeficiency syndrome for which HRT
    was required - there is serious money\r\nto be made.\r\n\r\n*Sex, Lies and Pharmaceuticals*,

    women have a chemical deficit in their brain\r\nthat causes low desire is an absurd
