  content: "Women's rights have taken a battering this festive season. The Briggs
    fiasco, the Gayle insult to the professionalism of Channel Ten reporter Mel McLaughlin,
    and marauding hoodlums in Germany using women's rights as a cover for a violent
    rampage against refugees all show the battle for gender equality is far from over.
    \r\n\r\nBut there is good news, too: good news about girls and selfies. Ugly selfies
    in particular, and what I believe is their subversive, feminist intent.\r\n\r\nThe
    ugly selfie that has caught my eye is that taken and shared by the girl herself.
    It may have been snapped with the intent of capturing her double-chin or zitty
    skin. Or perhaps it was chosen from a phalanx of selfies in which she was trying
    to look good. She might share it with just one person or a few, either through
    text or a social media platform like Facebook or Instagram. \r\n\r\nTo be clear,
    I'm not interested in the selfie posted on websites next to a \"pretty\" image
    of the same girl. Or a selfie a girl tags as an #uglyselfie when in fact she's
    tried hard, and succeeded, in looking good. These selfies are confirmation, as
    if any were needed, that the toxic cult of appearance is live and well in Australia
    and imposing the same limits on today's young women as it did on generations past.
    \r\n\r\nTruly ugly selfies reflect positive self-regard and trusting relationships
    between girls â\x80\x93 both must-have items on any feminist wish-list for empowered
    women.\r\n\r\nDespite older generations wringing their hands about the moral jeopardy
    of the internet generation, there is no evidence to suggest that the current generation
    is more narcissistic or socially isolated than those preceding it. Instead, like
    the rest of us, they just live more of their lives online. For teenagers this
    makes cyber space just another place to communicate with one another for a range
    of purposes. These include information sharing, identity formation and searching
    for intimacy in friendships and sexual relationships.\r\n\r\nThe girls I interviewed
    didn't send ugly selfies to boys or, if they did, only to ones who were friends.
    The exception was the hot selfie sent to a love interest by a girl pretending
    it's ugly (see above for why this is not really an ugly selfie at all). \r\n\r\nUgly
    selfies are all about girls cultivating, displaying and enjoying close and trusting
    relationships with other girls. \r\n\r\nThey show girls are trusting and close
    because implicit in a girl's decision to share an ugly selfie is trust that her
    friend won't share the unflattering image with anyone else, and won't judge the
    sharer for it. \r\n\r\nUgly selfies can also test the water of a new friendship.
    As one 15-year-old girl told me: \"Sometimes I just send one for the sake of it.
    The first ugly selfie of the friendship kind of confirms how comfortable you are
    with this person and sets the [trust and intimacy] standard for the friendship\".
    Where a girl wishes to hedge, she might send the unflattering image via Snapchat,
    which erases an image seconds after it is viewed. While this doesn't stop the
    receiver taking a screenshot of the ugly image and sending it around anyway, this
    mode of sending makes the sender's intention, and thus her friend's betrayal,
    obvious. \r\n\r\nSharing an ugly selfie can also deepen the friendship between
    girls. This is because ugly selfies are funny and we all know that sharing a joke
    creates intimacy. As one 14-year-old told me: \"The closer the friend, the uglier
    the photo!\"\r\n\r\nUgly selfies can also be used to show that a girl doesn't
    have tickets on her appearance but is worthy enough to be taken seriously. As
    one 19-year-old girl explained to me, this is because kids tend to agree with
    adults that \"selfies are generally seen as a kind of self-obsessed thing to do\".
    Sharing an ugly selfie says you aren't self-obsessed but a woman able to laugh
    at herself, even when it comes to appearance, which in days gone by, was a deadly
    serious affair. \r\n\r\nGone are the days of rare and treasured stills of momentous
    occasions, formally composed and curated for albums that are a self-conscious
    record of a family's preferred story. Selfies have come of age in a world where
    images are like words â\x80\x93 cheap and plentiful enough to throw away.\r\n\r\nBut
    like a throw-away line, selfies can be meaningless or incisive. They can demonstrate
    conformity or a rebuke â\x80\x93 however coded â\x80\x93 to the world as it stands.
    \r\n\r\nUgly selfies have emerged from the same place as the animated before-and-after-Photoshopped
    images made famous by feminist outlets like Jezebel. While the Photoshop-reveal
    genre seeks to shore up female self-esteem by revealing the fakery of the ideals
    girls are invited to envy, the ugly selfie reassures girls that good looks are
    irrelevant to one of the most important sources of satisfying intimacy â\x80\x93
    their female friends. \r\n\r\nBoth show feminism is alive and kicking, and making
    a difference in women's real and cyber worlds. Through their demolition of the
    claim that women do and should compete with each other for men, the ugly selfie
    and Photoshop-reveal demonstrate the power of the sisterhood to defend women against
    the self-doubt and isolation from which patriarchal consumer cultures profits.
