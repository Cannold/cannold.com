    Michael\r\nNeal scandal rolls on, with the Health Minister Bronwyn Pike now\r\nadmitting
    that the health department â\x80\x9Cbungledâ\x80\x9D the case, we need to\r\nconsider
    whether the â\x80\x9Cbetter protocolsâ\x80\x9D being mooted as the answer for\r\nprotecting
    public health in the future are really the answer. Or does\r\nofficialdom need
    to dig deeper to discover why transmission rates of HIV\r\nin Victoria are high
    and rising.\r\n\r\nI think we need to dig deeper. Down, in fact, to the central
    moral\r\nclaims of the safe sex message at the heart of public health campaigns\r\nto
    reduce transmission of HIV/AIDS.\r\n\r\nDebates about the moral adequacy of the
    safe sex message have been going\r\non in the HIV Positive community for years.
    On one side are those who\r\nsupport public health messages focused solely on
    the responsibility\r\nindividuals have to protect themselves from infection. From
    campaigns\r\nthat cajole men to not be a fool and â\x80\x9Ccover their toolâ\x80\x9D,
    to the â\x80\x9Ccover\r\nyourself against AIDSâ\x80\x9D and â\x80\x9Clove is not
    enoughâ\x80\x9D messages, the existing\r\neducational focus emphasizes the need
    for people who wish to avoid\r\ninfection to watch their own backs. Commented
    the CEO of the Victorian\r\nAIDS Council on the Neal case: â\x80\x9CWithout wishing
    to sound like the last\r\nof the rugged individualists, people do need to take
    the responsibility\r\nto protect themselvesâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nOf course the flip
    side of the â\x80\x9Citâ\x80\x99s all down to youâ\x80\x9D approach is that\r\nwhen
    unsafe consensual sex does result in transmission, it is the newly\r\ninfected
    partner who wears the blame. This is particularly the case. it\r\nappears, if
    the reason the HIV-negative person had unprotected sex\r\nbecause they trusted
    that a positive partner would either disclose his\r\nstatus or simply refuse to
    proceed without a condom. â\x80\x9CWeâ\x80\x99re trying to\r\nwork on educating
    people not to make those mistakes and assumptions that\r\nstuff up their livesâ\x80\x9D,
    the convener of the National Association of\r\nPeople Living with HIV/AIDS said
    recently.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the debate are those like the former convener
    of\r\nPositive Women Philomena Horsley who reject the blame-the-victim feel of\r\nthis
    hyper-individualist approach to public health. They contend that\r\nwhile there
    may be good reason to design public health messages to\r\ntrigger the natural
    inclination of most to look out for number one, the\r\nmoral inadequacy of this
    approach - and itâ\x80\x99s lack of cohesion with the\r\nmoral expectations of
    many - demands an urgent revamp. They note that\r\nnot only do some gay men assume
    their sexual partner will do the right\r\nthing by them, this propensity to trust
    others not to do the dirty on\r\nthem is not just a normal and good thing, it
    is largely justified.\r\nAccording to a recent report by the Australian Research
    Centre for Sex,\r\nHealth and Society, the vast majority of HIV positive men in
    Australia\r\ndo disclose their status to sexual partners at the beginning of a\r\nrelationship
    or the moment they discover it themselves, while the\r\nmajority wear condoms
    in casual encounters with partners whose HIV\r\nstatus they either do not know
    or know to be negative.\r\n\r\nIn other words, despite consistent communications
    to the sexually active\r\nof all varieties that the only obligations we have are
    to ourselves,\r\nthose infected by the virus - and at risk of infection - expect
    more\r\nthan this, both from ourselves and from others. We expect that as human\r\nbeings
    we have obligations not to harm our fellows, and that having HIV\r\nor being at
    risk of it doesnâ\x80\x99t ameliorate this responsibility one jot.\r\n\r\nNor
    should it. It is not â\x80\x9Cruggedly individualisticâ\x80\x9D but rather morally\r\noffensive
    for public health messages to imply that we have no\r\nresponsibilities to other
    human beings, and that we are chumps when we\r\nexpect others to recognize and
    honor their obligations to us. Not just\r\noffensive, but out of touch with the
    everyday sexual morality practiced\r\nby many, and dismissive of the needs and
    circumstances of particular\r\nat-risk communities.\r\n\r\nMost notable of these
    is the small but sadly growing community of\r\npositive women. Women commonly
    contract HIV from their spouses or steady\r\nboyfriends, men who these women trust
    are not just faithful but\r\nstraight. Public health messages that imply that
    these women had no one\r\nto blame but themselves for infection because they didnâ\x80\x99t
    insist that\r\nâ\x80\x9Cif it wasnâ\x80\x99t on, it wasnâ\x80\x99t onâ\x80\x9D
    overlook the culpability these men bear\r\nfor failing to disclose their risk
    factors or to insist that a condom be\r\nworn every time.\r\n\r\nWhat is the answer?
    Iâ\x80\x99d like to see a â\x80\x9CSafe Sex Plusâ\x80\x9D approach to\r\nreducing
    infection rates. Men and women should continue to be told that\r\nthe best way
    of protecting themselves from infection is to ensure\r\ncondoms are part of each
    sexual encounter, but they must also be\r\nreminded of their obligation to do
    the right thing by others.\r\n\r\nIf individuals know they are or might be positive,
    they have an\r\nobligation to protect their sexual partner by either disclosing
    what\r\nthey know - or donâ\x80\x99t know - about their HIV status, or simply
    insisting\r\non a condom every time. And if infection does occur, it is not those
    who\r\ntrusted in others not to harm them who deserve blame, but those who\r\ndidnâ\x80\x99t
    do all that they could to avoid doing the harming."
