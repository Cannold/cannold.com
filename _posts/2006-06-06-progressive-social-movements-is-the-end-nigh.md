  content: "*The challenge for feminists is to beat a system that still stifles\r\nthem*\r\n\r\nThere
    is a self-flagellatory streak in feminist books these days. The\r\nunderlying
    message is that the biggest problem contemporary women face\r\nis that â\x80\x9Cfeministsâ\x80\x9D
    didnâ\x80\x99t tell them that they couldnâ\x80\x99t â\x80\x9Chave it allâ\x80\x9D,\r\nrather
    than the fact that even in our so-called equal-opportunity world,\r\nthey still
    canâ\x80\x99t.\r\n\r\nThis rush to blame may be a sign of larger and more fundamental
    - even\r\nfatal - problems affecting the womenâ\x80\x99s and other progressive
    social\r\nmovements. As Carmen Laurence put it recently on Compass, such movements\r\nhave
    failed to offer an understanding of the nature and purpose of\r\nsociety to counter
    the individualistic market-based philosophy of\r\nliberal capitalist countries
    like the UK, the US and Australia: a\r\nphilosophy that says the role of the individual
    is to compete with\r\nothers for access to the means to buy more stuff.\r\n\r\nAt
    the heart of the liberal world view is a vision of individuals\r\ncompeting on
    a level playing field for the freedom to make whatever\r\nchoices they like, as
    long as these donâ\x80\x99t interfere with the similar\r\nfreedom of others. This
    view implies that the unhappiness of any group\r\nmust be a consequence of their
    bad choices: choices for which they have\r\nno one to blame but themselves. They
    could, and should, have chosen\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nEnter the politics of informed
    consent which, in the Liberal world-view,\r\nprovides one of the few ways those
    whoâ\x80\x99ve made bad choices can escape\r\nblame. From the feminist health
    movement to the more recent co-option of\r\nfeminist health principles by abortion
    foes, defenders of informed\r\nconsent assert that choices are only legitimate
    if they are made free\r\nfrom coercion and in the face of substantial understanding
    of the\r\nrelevant facts. Indeed, the claim that women didnâ\x80\x99t know because
    they\r\nwerenâ\x80\x99t told - and so arenâ\x80\x99t to blame for their choices
    - is at the\r\nheart of post-feminist complaints like Hausseggerâ\x80\x99s.\r\n\r\nBut
    while informed consent is a necessary tool for the protection of\r\nindividual
    autonomy, political movements based on nothing more than the\r\nfostering of individual
    choice have a slim chance of success, despite\r\nthe promotion of this sort of
    approach by commentators like Miranda\r\nDevine as the basis of a â\x80\x9Cnew
    feminismâ\x80\x9D. This is because, â\x80\x9Cchoice to do\r\nwhat?â\x80\x9D will
    always be the next question thatâ\x80\x99s asked, and not all\r\nchoices are the
    same. We donâ\x80\x99t allow people to sell themselves into\r\nslavery, no matter
    how informed or voluntary they declare themselves to\r\nbe, nor do we have much
    respect for the mega-rich who freely and\r\nknowledgeably reject all philanthropic
    appeals.\r\n\r\nAnother well-worn route out of this conundrum is for progressives
    to\r\nshow the falsity of liberal claims that the gladiatorial contest for\r\npurchasing
    power takes place on level playing field. However, the\r\nculture wars clearly
    showed how such an approach can be effectively\r\ncastigated for encouraging a
    â\x80\x9Cculture of complaintâ\x80\x9D, a â\x80\x9Cblack-armbandâ\x80\x9D\r\nview
    of the world or a â\x80\x9Cvictim mentalityâ\x80\x9D in which excuses rather than\r\naction
    rule the day. This does not mean that progressives canâ\x80\x99t, or\r\nshouldnâ\x80\x99t,
    continue to point to the significant gap between the promise\r\nof liberal capitalism
    and what it delivers. But they should do so in the\r\nknowledge that while negative
    campaigns may undermine an opponent, they\r\nprovide little succour for the alternative.
    Perhaps this is why the\r\nmajority of Australians have granted control of both
    houses of\r\nparliament to a market-worshipping government while at the same time\r\ntelling
    researchers that Australian society puts too much emphasis on\r\nmoney and not
    enough on the things that really matter.\r\n\r\nWhat is the answer? Progressives
    must make the critique of the marketâ\x80\x99s\r\ncapacity to deliver happiness
    a first order priority. Once able to meet\r\nthe basics of life, additional money
    doesnâ\x80\x99t increase our feelings of\r\nwell-being, as the 23% of Australians
    whoâ\x80\x99ve already downshifted to a\r\ntime-rich and money-poor alternative
    clearly understand. As well,\r\nprogressives must exploit what religion, philosophy
    and the social\r\nsciences all confirm are powerful sources of human motivation
    and\r\nhappiness - family, community, identity, solidarity, security, trust,\r\nlove,
    creativity, mastery, autonomy and fairness - to articulate an\r\nalternative objective
    for Australian society. We want to feel good about\r\nourselves, which entails
    spending time with family, feeling part of our\r\ncommunities, acting with integrity
    and in accordance with the values we\r\nsee as implicated in a meaningful life.\r\n\r\nWe
    know that what the continental Europeans disdainfully regard as\r\nAnglo-Saxon
    liberalism is not the answer, and that consumerism has been\r\na wash-out too.
    But before we can step off the wheel, weâ\x80\x99re going to\r\nneed a vision
    of where weâ\x80\x99re headed and someone to show the way. It is\r\nthe job of
    social progressives to articulate a vision and to answer the\r\nall important
    question of how we can get there from here."
