    is that we could finally stop talking about the issue and deal with something
    else.\r\n\r\nLet's face it. If you didn't see the boats on TV or hear politicians
    yakking about them, you'd have no idea what is consistently referred to as a ''problem''
    even existed. This contrasts with cost of living rises, affordable housing shortages
    or the extreme weather patterns caused by climate change, which affect us â\x80\x93
    or those we know â\x80\x93 directly.\r\n\r\nOn some levels, Australians know this.
    A parliamentary paper on the issue noted that even the roughly half of the population
    that support offshore processing and mandatory detention don't let it affect their
    vote.\r\n\r\nThe totemic meaning of the issue can be found in the public conversation
    about boat people, which we've been having since the 1970s. Boat arrivals trigger
    fears of losing control, anxiety about being duped and the age-old fear of missing
    out.\r\n\r\nPolitical rhetoric about boat arrivals and once-over-lightly media
    coverage conspire to refine and encourage these fears. The trickle of rickety
    sea vessels ''violates our borders'', while unarmed men, women and children, it
    is slyly implied, could be Islamist terrorists.\r\n\r\nFor those who persist with
    compassion, the evil people-smuggler is rolled out to show us the folly of our
    trusting natures. The queue-jumping charge and call for an ''orderly'' resettlement
    program play to concerns about control and the need for fair process to determine
    and resettle ''genuine refugees''.\r\n\r\nIt is this last anxiety that most interests
    me. Formal processes designed to guarantee fairness are part of our democratic
    heritage and are rightly valued. Writ large, they encompass notions such as the
    rule of law, which makes us all answerable to the law, equal before it and similarly
    subjected to its rigours.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that a nation descended
    from members of  Britain's less-privileged social classes is alive to the necessity
    of rules being both fair and uniformly applied if those without privilege are
    to have a shot at accessing scarce resources.\r\n\r\nBut this brings the question:
    How scarce is the resource boat people want? If the resource is onshore processing,
    the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has noted that Australia has both the territory
    and resources to manage it.\r\n\r\nBut what boat people are really seeking is
    resettlement in Australia and, while most deemed refugees processed here will
    begin their new life straight away, those found worthy offshore may languish for
    years there.\r\n\r\nIt is this latter fact that drives the boat traffic. Where
    faced with the prospect of resettlement in the West in a reasonable period of
    time, few would spend what money they have to risk their and their children's
    lives on a perilous trip.\r\n\r\nI don't judge those trying to take matters into
    their own hands. Most of those who escaped Nazi Germany or survived the rigours
    of the Warsaw ghetto would have been similarly determined to survive and thrive.\r\n\r\nThe
    solution is plain. We must increase the number of refugees we resettle from our
    paltry quota of 6000.  Of the 71 countries that take refugees, we rank 38th on
    a per head  basis behind Kazakhstan, Guinea, Djibouti and Syria.\r\n\r\nThe long-game
    is about reducing the insecurity and strife that drives people to leave the land
    and language of their birth and do whatever it takes to call a haven like Australia
    home."
