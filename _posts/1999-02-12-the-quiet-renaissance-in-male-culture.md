    Three Dollars.\r\n\r\nA renaissance in male culture, in which male artists and
    public\r\npersonalities are mapping new ways of relating to women and to one\r\nanother,
    has begun. Many of these developments are nothing short of\r\nradical.\r\n\r\nStandard
    screen depictions of male friendships are characterised by\r\naggressive, sometimes
    even violent, interaction between the male\r\nprotagonists. If the sound of a
    film like White Men Canâ\x80\x99t Jump is\r\nlowered, the facial expressions and
    body language of Billy (Woody\r\nHarrelson) and Sidney (Wesley Snipes) makes it
    impossible to tell if\r\nthey are friends or enemies. But even without the sound,
    it is\r\nimpossible to mistake the relationship in Good Will Hunting between Will\r\n(Matt
    Damon) and Chuckie (Ben Affleck) for anything other than the\r\nAustralian Oxfordâ\x80\x99s
    definition of friendship: a relationship in which\r\none is jointed to another
    in intimacy and affection.\r\n\r\nThis change to the definition and description
    of male friendship is the\r\nmost startling, and to my mind most moving, aspect
    of the male\r\nrenaissance.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, the traditional power topography
    of male-female intimate\r\nrelations has given way under the pressure of womenâ\x80\x99s
    organised and\r\nindividual insistence on change. These demands, and their accompanying\r\nvalidation
    of female emotional and sexual power, have been articulated\r\nand codified in
    alternative and mainstream female artistic output.\r\n\r\nThe same, however, can
    not be said of the change in menâ\x80\x99s relationships\r\nwith one another being
    mapped out in the male cultural renaissance.\r\nFeminist analysis and interest
    in male-to-male relations has been scant,\r\nbecause feminism is a movement about
    women and because the power\r\nanalysis central to feminist thinking provides
    little insight into the\r\nshortcomings of male-to-male relations.\r\n\r\nInstead,
    these changes seem both by and for men, with women either\r\nbenignly absent or
    featuring only peripherally.\r\n\r\nIn Romulus, My Father, Raimond Gaita walks
    us through his relationship\r\nwith his father and his fatherâ\x80\x99s best friend,
    who joined together to\r\nraise him when his mother became incapacitated by mental
    illness.\r\nGaitaâ\x80\x99s style is appealingly understated as he uses the everyday\r\nexperiences
    of his turbulent life to reveal how his father Romulus lived\r\n- and was in essence
    defined - by the moral codes he passed on to his\r\nphilosopher son.\r\n\r\nIn
    Buy Now, Pay Later (off the Whitlamsâ\x80\x99 best-selling album Eternal\r\nNightcap),
    Tim Freedman urges his friend Charlie to abandon his heroin\r\nhabit and return
    to caring about and being cared for by his friends and\r\ngirlfriend. Everything
    about the songâ\x80\x99s characteristics and performance\r\n- from the lyrics
    to the tempo of the music - seek to emphasise, rather\r\nthan use false bravado
    to disguise, the pain and disillusionment\r\nFreedman feels as a result of his
    friendâ\x80\x99s drug-enforced emotional\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\nThe central protagonists
    of the new male renaissance are mostly, though\r\nnot exclusively, members of
    Generation X (Gaita, for instance, is a Baby\r\nBoomer). Gangland author Mark
    Davis might argue that this partially\r\nexplains the indifference of the largely
    Baby Boom cultural ruling class\r\nto the sort of generational change seen in
    the renaissance.\r\n\r\nBut many in Generation X also see little in the renaissance
    about which\r\nto crow. Their matter-of-fact attitude is summed up well by my\r\n29-year-old
    partnerâ\x80\x99s disinterest in the central theme of this piece:\r\nthat the
    progressive approach that Generation X males take towards\r\nmale-female/male-male
    relations is worthy of note. â\x80\x9CThatâ\x80\x99s just the way\r\nthings are
    now,â\x80\x9D he says impatiently, â\x80\x9Cwhatâ\x80\x99s there to talk about?â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nPerhaps.
    But the men of Generation X seem to appreciate the depth of\r\nrevelation and
    intimacy possible in their relationships with women and\r\nother men. And, as
    any good behavioralist knows, if positive behavior is\r\nto stay positive, it
    needs reinforcement.\r\n\r\nBut this is only true if the behavior is being performed
    to please\r\nanother. And perhaps this is the nugget of the low-key way Generation
    X\r\nmen regard their new relationship approach: that they are doing it for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThey
    have not changed to earn pats of approval from their fathers or\r\nmothers, previous
    generations of feminists, or the women they live with\r\nand love. Rather, they
    act as they do because this is the way to unlock\r\nthe deepest and most satisfying
    intimacy potential of their\r\nrelationships - be they with women or other men.
    And that is its own\r\nreward."
