    the connection between the abortion procedure and the woman's current condition

    ''late-term'' abortions raises questions in the community.\n\nOne is why women
    have abortions later in pregnancy. It's a question that is rarely answered. Academic
    experts and activists decline because they don't like the assumption that's usually
    behind it, which is that we must turn to the foetus, not the woman, to discover
    the morality of abortion. Victorian women who terminate after 24 weeks and the
    few providers who help them are silenced by uncertain laws, threats of violence
    - a security guard was murdered several years ago at a Melbourne clinic - and
    the relentless shame our society heaps on anyone who has \nanything to do with
    abortion.\n\nBut I think the time has come to discuss the reasons women's presentation
    for abortion, or their access to the service, can be delayed; the reasons that
    the medical profession tends to approve of, and those that it does not.\n\nThe
    statistics on women in Victoria having terminations from 24 weeks into pregnancy
    are incomplete, badly presented and out of date - but they still allow us to estimate
    the number at slightly fewer than 138 women a year.\n\nSome hospitals won't provide
    any terminations, some not at later stages. Others restrict access, granting a
    woman's request only where she or the foetus have a serious medical condition.
    And I mean serious.\n\nCommittees are nearly always convened for such cases, to
    decide whether the risk to the woman's life or health is certain enough, or the
    conditions affecting the foetus are catastrophic enough, for the answer to be
    ''yes''. Women are barred from speaking to these committees, though it is they,
    their partners and existing children who will wear the consequences of the judgment
    made. If they pass muster, they'll be offered a safe, lawful abortion. If it's
    ''no'', they'll be shown the door.\n\nSome women will have an unwanted child,
    a risky endeavour because unwanted children are at increased risk of mental illness
    and poor psychosocial development. Others will push on in search of an abortion
    and perhaps find their way to Croydon.\n\nThere they'll meet women seeking abortions
    for ''psychosocial'' reasons. Indeed, in the official statistics, abortions done
    to save the life and health of the mother are categorised as psychosocial. This
    is despite the fact that hospital access restrictions imply, and pro-life advocates
    argue, that psychosocial reasons are silly and trivial. As pro-life campaigner
    Margaret Tighe put it when news of the Croydon case broke last week, ''psychosocial
    reasons are just an excuse''.\n\nBut are they? In Victoria, the reasons women
    seek abortions after 24 weeks include the women not being a woman at all but a
    girl aged 11 to 15. They include the fact that the pregnancy was the result of
    rape or incest. Psychosocial indicators take in women who are victims of domestic
    violence and women with intellectual disabilities or psychiatric conditions such
    as paranoid schizophrenia and suicidal depression. Heroin and alcohol addiction
    also fall under the psychosocial heading, as do cases of women from religious
    migrant families that might, upon learning of the pregnancy, set them alight.
    Women who had planned to continue the pregnancy until they learnt an existing
    child or their husband had cancer fell into this category, as do women who have
    been delayed by medical incompetence (like failures to diagnose pregnancy) or
    obstructed by ignorant or pro-life doctors who wrongly advise that abortion is
    illegal or that they are too far gone.\n\nSilly and trivial? I don't think so.
    Nor, apparently, do the obstetricians who told ABC News that the Croydon clinic
    ''performs a valuable service to women in need'', though it would have been nicer
    if they had added their names and faces to the testimonial.\n\nIf we want a clinic
    like the one in Croydon, if we want there to be somewhere for desperate women
    - including ourselves, our daughters, sisters and friends - to go when everyone
    else turns them away, then we must stand up and be counted.\n\nGovernments must
    insist all public hospitals provide safe abortion services. Medical professionals
    who think the work matters must push their institutions to help women whose presentation
    for an abortion is delayed, rather than judge by committee and send them packing.\nAnd
    women who have had abortions at later stages must stop skulking in the shadows
    of shame. \n\nThey must tell their friends and family their story, and speak to
    the media so the word gets out, so that everyone understands how later terminations
    happen and how it happened to them - and what it would have been like if they
    hadn't had the choice.\n"
