  content: "The recent rallying of Indian migrants in Sydney and Melbourne, and last\r\nMondayâ\x80\x99s
    *Four Corners* about the death of Aboriginal man Mr Ward, are\r\njust two recent
    reminders that racism is alive in Australia.\r\n\r\nWhile much remains the same
    on the racism front, there are also small\r\nchanges. These have come to my attention
    via my sons, each at different\r\nhigh schools in the inner city. When they or
    their friends - some of\r\nwhom have non-white faces - describe other kids, they
    refer to skin\r\ncolour in the same casual, comfortable way someone of my generation\r\nmight
    refer to eye colour.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CWhich one is he?â\x80\x9D I asked a back
    seat full of boys admiring the\r\nsporting achievements of a new and mutual friend
    named Kareem. â\x80\x9CHave I\r\nmet him?â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CYes, at the
    open day, Mum,â\x80\x9D my son replies. â\x80\x9CHeâ\x80\x99s the really, really\r\nblack
    one.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CWhoâ\x80\x99s that Asian chick?â\x80\x9D asked an
    old friend of my sonâ\x80\x99s, himself a\r\nchild of mixed-race parents.\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CShould
    you mention race like that?â\x80\x9D I queried one night at the dinner\r\ntable.
    â\x80\x9CMightnâ\x80\x99t you offend?â\x80\x9D Both sons looked at me as if I
    had\r\nsprouted antennae. â\x80\x9CAdults are so hung up about race,â\x80\x9D
    the 14-year-old\r\nsighed. â\x80\x9CItâ\x80\x99s not that big a deal for kids.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nâ\x80\x9CItâ\x80\x99s
    even more offensive not to mention it,â\x80\x9D chimed in the younger.\r\nâ\x80\x9CLike
    you were ignoring it because it was wrong.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nI thought about this
    and decided it made sense. Discriminating, in the\r\nsense of drawing distinctions,
    is not a problem. It is the use of such\r\ndistinctions to justify unequal treatment
    thatâ\x80\x99s wrong. As long as my\r\nchildren see skin colour as a trivial but
    useful characteristic to\r\nindicate which person they are talking about, itâ\x80\x99s
    hard to see the harm.\r\nIndeed, if the Aussie look can come to include people
    of colour, it\r\ncould be beneficial.\r\n\r\nBut my sons are also using race to
    stereotype their fellow students.\r\nAsians are math whizzes, Jews are dweebs,
    while Skips excel at sport.\r\nEven where such ideas can be shown to be patently
    false - a photo of an\r\noutstanding sporting team at one boyâ\x80\x99s school
    is littered with non-Anglo\r\nfaces - they insist they are useful. â\x80\x9CWe
    joke about it, Mum,â\x80\x9D one\r\ninsists. â\x80\x9CWhen I walk into maths class,
    the Asian kids hum *Stupid\r\nBoy*.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nBut fixed and oversimplified
    ideas of who we are and what we can achieve\r\nbased on involuntary and irrelevant
    attributes such as skin colour are\r\nracist. This is true even where the attributes
    ascribed to a racial\r\ngroup are positive, such as â\x80\x9Cblacks are great
    at sportâ\x80\x9D.\r\n\r\nThe reasons why are many and varied, but include the
    likelihood that\r\ngroup members who donâ\x80\x99t fit the mould will be seen
    as deviant, not to\r\nmention having their real talents ignored.\r\n\r\nAs well,
    the positive stereotyping of one group compels the negative\r\nstereotyping of
    others. If Asians are good at maths, then blacks and\r\nwhites, relatively speaking,
    must be bad at it. And all such\r\nstereotyping affects real-world performance.\r\n\r\nFor
    instance, one study found that when black students were told a test\r\nmeasured
    intelligence, they performed badly, but when the same test was\r\npresented as
    a problem-solving exercise, they did as well as whites.\r\nAnother showed that
    when athletic performance was linked to\r\nâ\x80\x9Cintelligenceâ\x80\x9D, black
    sportspeople did worse than whites but linking it\r\nto â\x80\x9Cnatural athletic
    abilityâ\x80\x9D saw whites perform worse.\r\n\r\nRace might say what we look
    like, but not who we are. I will speak to my\r\nboys about it again tonight."
