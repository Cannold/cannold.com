    is in the criminal code in many states in Australia, including\r\nthe state of
    Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital. However, in\r\n1969 the state court
    ruled that abortion was defensible if the doctor\r\nhonestly believed on reasonable
    grounds that it was necessary to\r\npreserve the womanâ\x80\x99s physical or mental
    health. While this judgements\r\nhas resulted in Victorian women having good access
    to safe termination\r\nservices early in pregnancy, it also clearly established
    abortion as a\r\nmedical prerogative, not a womanâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9Cchoice,â\x80\x9D
    or â\x80\x9Cright.â\x80\x9D Indeed, after\r\nthe story of the 32-week abortion
    was leaked to the press, the Royal\r\nWomenâ\x80\x99s quickly established an inquiry
    to reassure the public that they\r\nwould be assessing the reasons doctors had
    for performing the\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\nNews reports of the complex case at
    the Royal Womenâ\x80\x99s - about which\r\nnothing has been heard from the woman
    herself - have focused less on the\r\nlegal aspects of the case, and more on the
    ethical issues usually seen\r\nto surround late-term abortions: the late gestational
    age of the fetus\r\nand the seriousness of its predicted disability. While only
    5 per cent\r\nof terminations are performed after 14 weeks, around half of these
    are\r\ndone because of potential damage to the fetus.\r\n\r\nMy research suggests
    that while most women see abortion as a moral\r\nissue, they nominate different
    ethical concerns to the masculinist ones\r\nmainstream academics and journalists
    glibly presume to be at issue. Such\r\nviews equate â\x80\x9Cviableâ\x80\x9D fetuses
    with babies born, and consequently reduce\r\npregnancy to an issue of â\x80\x9Cfetal
    location.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nWomen, not surprisingly, see the relationship between
    mother and fetus\r\nas meaningful and at the heart of the moral issues that surround\r\nabortion.
    Many see the pregnant woman as morally obliged to commit as\r\nearly as possible
    either to gestating the fetus and raising the child\r\nthat results, or to obtaining
    a termination.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Womenâ\x80\x99s case demonstrates how social and
    medical attitudes and\r\npractices surrounding pregnancy may, by imposing alternative
    ethical\r\nrequirements on pregnant women, alienate them from their own intuitive\r\nunderstanding
    of the range and limits of the moral obligations that\r\narise from the â\x80\x9Cpregnant
    relationship:â\x80\x9D the evolving relationship\r\nbetween the pregnant woman
    and her fetus.\r\n\r\nDuring pregnancy a woman is becoming a mother, a process
    she completes\r\nwhen the child is born. At the center of this becoming is her
    evolving\r\nrelationship with her fetus. For most women this relationship is\r\ninitially
    only known, not felt (â\x80\x9CThe line in the box on the stick says I\r\nam pregnant
    but I donâ\x80\x99t feel anything.â\x80\x9D), but it comes to occupy the\r\ncenter
    of her thoughts, dreams, hopes and body by the time the baby is\r\ndue. Most women
    increasingly come to love the fetus inside them as it\r\nprogressively makes its
    presence felt in her body and life. As time goes\r\non, they grow eager for the
    baby to emerge from their bodies, where they\r\nwill â\x80\x9Cconsummateâ\x80\x9D
    the relationship begun in-utero, through sight, smell,\r\ntouch and nurture.\r\n\r\nThe
    existence and practice of antenatal screening imposes other ethical\r\nimperatives
    on women, while the limitations of the screens may hinder\r\nthe normal development
    of the relationship between mother and fetus.\r\n\r\nEthicist Paul Laurtizen believes
    the mere existence of medical\r\ntechnology can compel people to â\x80\x9Cchooseâ\x80\x9D
    it. In other words, if a woman\r\ndoes not choose to have a pre-natal screen and
    she gives birth to a\r\ndisabled child, some will see her as having chosen to
    have a child with\r\na disability (and therefore as solely responsible for the
    social and\r\nfinancial costs of its care).\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of doctors
    are enthusiastic supporters of antenatal\r\nscreening. They assume women do and
    should choose these tests only when\r\nthey are willing to terminate a fetus with
    a disability, and many expect\r\nand encourage women to choose termination when
    test results are\r\nâ\x80\x9Cnegative.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nThis enthusiasm takes place
    against a backdrop of social\r\nindifference~~~~some would say antagonism~~~~towards
    people with\r\ndisabilities.\r\n\r\nHowever, some antenatal tests, such as the
    one for dwarfism, can only be\r\nperformed very late in pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThese
    pressures put women in a bind. They are seen as morally\r\nirresponsible if they
    decide against screening, or refuse to terminate\r\nan anomalous fetus, but are
    castigated as callous and unmaternal if they\r\ndo decide to terminate a disabled
    fetus late in pregnancy. In addition,\r\nthe pressure to screen and terminate
    runs counter to the attachment and\r\ncommitment many women feel and believe they
    should feel to their fetus.\r\n\r\nSome may seek to resolve these dilemmas by
    holding off coming to know,\r\nlove and commit to the fetus inside them until
    they have been given the\r\nmedical â\x80\x9Call-clear.â\x80\x9D Remaining â\x80\x9Ctentativeâ\x80\x9D
    about their pregnancy, to use\r\nethicist Barbara Rothmanâ\x80\x99s phrase, may
    be a womanâ\x80\x99s best way of\r\nprotecting herself emotionally as she tries
    to negotiate the\r\ncontradictory moral demands imposed on her by the medical
    profession and\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nSome have argued that the Royal Womenâ\x80\x99s
    Hospital case demonstrates the\r\nethical burdens faced by the medical profession
    and the urgent need for\r\nlaw reform. I would argue that what this case mostly
    demonstrates is the\r\nuntenable moral and practical burdens imposed on pregnant
    women in\r\nAustralian society.\r\n\r\nAs the technological management of pregnancy
    increases and the tools in\r\nthe medical armory expand, women are faced with
    increasingly difficult\r\nand intensely personal moral decisions, and increasingly
    harsh social\r\njudgments of the way they make themâ\x80\x94no matter what they
    choose.\r\n\r\nGreater respect for womenâ\x80\x99s moral agency and support of
    their struggle\r\nto make moral choices that make practical sense in an increasingly\r\ncomplex
    and constraining world are desperately needed.\r\n\r\nReforming the law to put
    the choice in womenâ\x80\x99s capable hands is only a\r\nstart."
