    say that I come from a Jewish background\r\nthough I did not circumcise either
    of my sons. It was a bugger of a\r\ndecision and I prayed for girls in hope of
    avoiding it. When this\r\nfailed, I considered the choice carefully, canvassing
    the medical,\r\nethical, social and cultural/religious issues in turn.\r\n\r\nAs
    I see it, the health case for and against circumcision cancel each\r\nother out
    (you can argue the toss, but essentially the evidence can be\r\nsummed up as â\x80\x9Cthere
    are no medical reasons for or against\r\ncircumcisionâ\x80\x9D). Social reasons
    for circumcising, like itâ\x80\x99s â\x80\x9Ccleanerâ\x80\x9D or\r\nâ\x80\x9CI
    want my son to look like Dad,â\x80\x9D are trivial and do not stand up well\r\nto
    scrutiny.\r\n\r\nThis leaves cultural/religious reasons that, in my case, were
    not\r\ncompelling. Iâ\x80\x99m not a believer, nor a member of a community that
    would\r\ncut me off-and reject my sons-if I did not circumcise. I did wonder\r\nwhether
    my sons might want to be members of such a community, but\r\nfigured that by the
    time they were old enough to make that decision,\r\nthey could decide for themselves
    about circumcision.\r\n\r\nIn general, when parents can defer a meaningful decision
    about their\r\nchild to a time when the child can have input, or preferably make
    it\r\nhimself, they should. I was able to do this with circumcision.\r\n\r\nBut
    for some parents, this would not be possible. What if there is a\r\nfamily history
    of urinary tract infections-a risk reduced by\r\ncircumcision in infancy? What
    if the parents are part of a community\r\nthat demands circumcision and they believe
    that their sonâ\x80\x99s acceptance\r\ninto this community is key to their current
    happiness and identity\r\nformation? Isnâ\x80\x99t the freedom to decide what
    is in our own and our\r\nchildâ\x80\x99s best interest what a liberal, democratic
    society is all about?\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that anything goes. Obviously
    if circumcision was\r\ndemonstrably injurious to a childâ\x80\x99s physical and
    mental health-as is\r\nfemale genital cutting-it must be outlawed, no matter what
    minority\r\ngroups say. But like Cinderellaâ\x80\x99s step sister straining at
    that glass\r\nslipper, anti-circumcision advocates canâ\x80\x99t make the evidence
    about male\r\ncircumcision fit. No matter how you look at it, male circumcision
    isnâ\x80\x99t\r\nmutilation or child abuse.\r\n\r\nThere is no shortage of those
    who know what is best for our kids.\r\nThankfully, Australian law puts parents
