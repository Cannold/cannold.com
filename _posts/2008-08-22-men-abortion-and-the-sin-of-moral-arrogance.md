  content: "Abortion is back in the news, with a bill now before the Victorian\r\nparliament
    that, if it becomes law, will give women with problem\r\npregnancies of less than
    twenty-four weeks the right to decide for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nWhenever abortion
    is at issue, questions about the place of men in the\r\ndebate looms large and
    unspoken. What role do men play in political and\r\npersonal discussions about
    termination, and what role - morally speaking\r\n- should they play?\r\n\r\nThe
    facts are simple. Men dominate the politics of abortion in the same\r\nway they
    do all other issues. One figure puts the percentage of\r\nanti-choice leaders
    who are men at 77%. This is in addition to the\r\nsignificant influence male religious
    leaders like the Pope (through the\r\nVaticanâ\x80\x99s full membership of the
    United Nations) have on reproductive\r\nhealth policy across the globe.\r\n\r\nEven
    on the pro-choice side, where most leadership roles are held by\r\nwomen, men
    have been critical to the success of campaigns that give\r\nwomen the right to
    decide. MP Wayne Berry was the architect of the 2002\r\nlegislation in the ACT
    that treats abortion like any other medical\r\nprocedure. Henry Morgentaler was
    key to achieving a similarly\r\nprogressive law in Canada in 1988.\r\n\r\nProblem
    pregnancies require decisions that touch on our most intimate\r\nexperiences and
    values concerning sex, fertility, love and\r\nrelationships. Here again, men feature
    large. Research shows that while\r\nthe vast majority of women faced with an unplanned
    pregnancy donâ\x80\x99t want\r\ncounselling, they do want information from the
    biological father.\r\nIndeed, he is the person they are most likely to consult
    as they\r\nconsider their choice. Does he want a child, now or ever? What role
    will\r\nhe play in raising it? What support might he provide if she decides to\r\ngo
    it alone? The presence of a man willing to engage in such\r\ndiscussions, and
    the answers he gives, will critically affect the\r\nwomanâ\x80\x99s decision.\r\n\r\nSo
    men do play a critical role in abortion politics and abortion\r\ndecisions. The
    question is, should they?\r\n\r\nMenâ\x80\x99s role in the decisions individual
    women make about problem\r\npregnancies is a simple fact of life to which no â\x80\x9Coughtâ\x80\x9D
    can or should\r\nbe applied.\r\n\r\nBut before you can determine the proper role
    of men in the political\r\ndebate, you must recognise the fact that-at the end
    of the day-a\r\ndecision about continuing or terminating a pregnancy is not open
    to\r\ncompromise. You canâ\x80\x99t have half a baby or half an abortion. While
    women\r\nin functioning, non-violent relationships do tend to consult the\r\nbiological
    father, ultimately one personâ\x80\x99s view must prevail. The law\r\nprivileges
    the womanâ\x80\x99s decision because the bodily experience of\r\npregnancy and
    birth invest her more heavily in the outcome.\r\n\r\nIt is also her call because,
    short of making a pregnant woman the\r\nbiological fatherâ\x80\x99s slave, there
    would be no way to enforce his right to\r\ndecide other than giving him the power
    to wrestle her on to the surgical\r\ntable (if she wants to continue and he wants
    to terminate) or snapping a\r\ncollar on her and handing him the lead (if she
    wants to terminate and he\r\nwants to continue).\r\n\r\nDoes menâ\x80\x99s disconnect
    from the risk and experience of pregnancy and\r\nbirth disqualify them from political
    activism on the issue? Part of the\r\nanswer turns on the weight you give to experience.\r\n\r\nImagine
    a woman-led and dominated group that sought to deny men access\r\nto safe and
    legal vasectomies on the grounds that the procedure is\r\ndangerous, that men
    might come to regret their decision and that\r\nvasectomies reduce the number
    of babies being born that infertile\r\ncouples would be more than happy to raise.\r\n\r\nDo
    we think such a group is legitimate? That its views should hold sway\r\non the
    laws passed by parliament? Or do the demands of such an\r\norganisation with regard
    to a procedure so intimately bound up with\r\nmenâ\x80\x99s bodies and lives strike
    you as inappropriate, patronising and\r\ndomineeringly presumptive?\r\n\r\nFor
    me, itâ\x80\x99s the latter. But I would feel differently if such a\r\nfemale-dominated
    group came into being in a world where men were\r\nstruggling to achieve the legal
    right to choose safe vasectomy, and the\r\ngroupâ\x80\x99s aims were to help men
    gain control over an issue so critical to\r\ntheir bodies and lives.\r\n\r\nWhat
    matters, in other words, is not that men are involved but how they\r\nare involved.\r\n\r\nMen
    lack moral standing in the abortion debate-indeed are guilty of\r\nmoral arrogance-when
    they push for control over a procedure theyâ\x80\x99ll\r\nnever have to have because
    they canâ\x80\x99t get pregnant.\r\n\r\nBut when men implicitly acknowledge their
    lesser standing by raising\r\ntheir voices in support of laws that take away power
    from their own sex\r\nin order to give it to women, they can feel confident they
    are doing the\r\nright thing."
