  content: "WINSTON Churchill said that a fanatic was a person who couldnâ\x80\x99t
    change\r\nhis mind and wouldnâ\x80\x99t change the subject.\r\n\r\nAccording to
    the dictionary, a fanatic is a person marked by an extreme,\r\nunreasoning enthusiasm
    for a cause.\r\n\r\nAt times, some of Australiaâ\x80\x99s prominent civil libertarians
    sound like\r\nfanatics - most recently when defending the rights of odious recidivist\r\nsex
    offenders such as Victoriaâ\x80\x99s Mr Baldy, due for release from prison\r\nin
    August.\r\n\r\nMr Baldy was locked up for serial crimes of kidnapping and shaving
    the\r\nheads of young boys before assaulting them. Soon after his first release\r\nfrom
    jail, he attacked a young child again.\r\n\r\nI know itâ\x80\x99s the job of Liberty
    Victoriaâ\x80\x99s vice-president, Jamie\r\nGardener, to condemn the intention
    of the Bracks Government to introduce\r\nelectronic tagging of repeat offenders
    like Mr Baldy. And I know itâ\x80\x99s\r\nhis job to say things such as: â\x80\x9CLiberty
    views with grave concern any\r\nadding-on of sentences to people who have served
    their time set down by\r\nthe courts, (because this) is not something that is
    consistent with\r\nhuman rights.â\x80\x9D\r\n\r\nBut what folks like Mr Gardener
    often seem to forget is that no civil\r\nright, no matter how important, is absolute.
    The rights of repeat sex\r\noffenders like Mr Baldy need to be balanced against
    those of the\r\nchildren to be protected from being his next victim.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    when absolute rights clash, impenetrable deadlock is the\r\nresult, and all chance
    of consensus are lost.\r\n\r\nThe question is, does the Bracks plan get that balance
    right? I think it\r\ndoes.\r\n\r\nMr Gardenerâ\x80\x99s worry seems to be that
    tagging offenders punishes them\r\ntwice ~~- first by incarceration, then by monitoring~~-
    for the same\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nBut this is not a continuing worry. If the tagging
    legislation passes,\r\nfuture sentences will include post-release surveillance
    rather than\r\nadding it on at the end.\r\n\r\nThis means that this problem -
    technically termed â\x80\x9Cdouble jeopardyâ\x80\x9D -\r\nfalls away.\r\n\r\nThe
    real infringement of electronic surveillance is on a prisonerâ\x80\x99s\r\nrights
    to privacy. WHETHER the data from their bracelet is downloaded\r\ndaily through
    the phone or transmitted in real time, those wearing\r\nelectronic tags will be
    living in the Panopticon - an architectural\r\nfigure envisioned by political
    philosopher Jeremy Bentham.\r\n\r\nIt has a central tower around which is built
    an annular structure\r\ndivided into cells that extend the entire width of the
    building to allow\r\nboth inner and outer windows.\r\n\r\nThe occupants of the
    cells are isolated from one another by walls, but\r\nable to be observed collectively
    and individually by an unseen observer\r\nin the tower.\r\n\r\nThe problem for
    the prisoners of the Panopticon is that they can be seen\r\n- and know they can
    - but they are unable to see in return. They have no\r\nidea of who is looking
    at them, when, and what - if anything - those\r\npeople plan to do with the knowledge
    they gain.0\r\n\r\nEven if data on their movements is not to be used against them\r\n(something
    that is not the case with the electronic tag, which will most\r\nlikely be used
    to ensure prisoners conform to whatever movement\r\nrestrictions the courts sets
    down as a condition of their release),\r\nthose in the Panopticon suffer a complete
    loss of privacy and the\r\ndignity and personal power that comes with it.\r\n\r\nBut
    if the electronic tags actually stop paedophiles from re-offending,\r\nthen this
    loss must be weighed against the gain of increased community\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nAccording
    to Don Thomson, Professor of Forensic Psychology at Charles\r\nSturt University,
    we have reason to think that tagging will deter\r\noffenders from committing further
    crimes against children. If the\r\nprisoner knows an alarm will sound if he violates
    prescribed boundaries,\r\nheâ\x80\x99s unlikely to do so on pain of either being
    caught in the act or, if\r\nthe violation is discovered only later, the certainty
    of being convicted\r\nand locked away, perhaps for good.\r\n\r\nAnd there is some
    evidence from a handful of studies that electronic\r\nmonitoring, if combined
    with effective therapy, does reduce rates of\r\nreoffending.\r\n\r\nBut this is
    the rub.\r\n\r\nWhile the government is effusive about the benefits of surveillance,\r\nthereâ\x80\x99s
    been no mention of increased funding for the evaluation and\r\nprovision of effective
    treatment for sex offenders. Yet is it critical\r\nthat such funding be provided,
    not only to ensure we get value from the\r\nmoney spent on the bracelets, but
    because treatment is the best way to\r\nmake the community as safe as we can for
    children.\r\n\r\nAccording to Professor Thomson, money is desperately needed to
    both\r\nproperly evaluate which treatments work and to provide them to convicts\r\ninside
    and outside the prison walls (where the temptation of real\r\nchildren running
    around provides the one true test of cure).\r\n\r\nUntil funds to do this work
    are found, we canâ\x80\x99t really look our children\r\nin the eye and say weâ\x80\x99ve
    done all we can to make them safe.\r\n\r\nBecause the best way to avoid released
    prisoners re-offending is not to\r\ntrack them, but to change them."
