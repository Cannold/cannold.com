    ***The Abortion Myth***\n\n> \"The women I interviewed, no matter what side of
    the abortion fence they were on,\" writes Leslie Cannold in The Abortion Myth,
    \"were clear that the fetus is alive, and abortion kills it. None of them, however,
    believed these facts proved that abortion was wrong.\" Cannold criticizes pro-choice
    feminists for denying the fetus in an effort to bring the woman back into focus
    as the locus of pregnancy and the agent of decision-making. In her view, women
    are moral persons for whom the decision to abort derives less from a sense of
    rights or privacy and more from a broader evaluation of what the \"right\" thing
    to do is. This evaluation speaks to their attitudes towards pregnancy and motherhood,
    and the real difference between pro- and anti-choice women is their level of trust
    that other women will \"act morally.\"\"\n\n> Cannold builds on the work of such
    scholars as Kristin Luker, Faye Ginsburg, and Carol Gilligan, and takes on the
    controversial work of her own mentor, Peter Singer, on how ectogenesis might affect
    the abortion decision. Methodologically, The Abortion Myth suffers from some of
    the same flaws as Gilligan's In a Different Voice - a small, self-selected sample
    - and Cannold's normative stance is clear throughout. She is, after all, a graduate
    student and fellow in bioethics. The author is American but does all her work
    in Australia, and it is certainly fruitful to hear other voices and perspectives
    coming from a non-U.S. context. The Abortion Myth has been revised and updated
    for an American audience. Where the original Australian edition was produced as
    a trade book, this new version, published by a university press consortium, reflects
    Cannold's desire to engage the enormous academic and political debate that surrounds
    abortion, especially in the United States. The result is an interesting and thought-provoking
    read for the sophisticated lay reader.\n\n[J.R. Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Abortion-Myth-Feminism-Morality-Choices/dp/0819563773)\n\n>
    U.S. born Cannold studied bioethics in Australia; her analysis of how women define
    the moral questions raised by abortion was first published in that country. The
    U.S. edition adds an introduction (placing the book in the context of American
    scholarship and urging a significant role for women's experience in ethical and
    psychological studies of abortion morality) and an appendix (on methodology) to
    a work that constructs a new ethics of abortion based on how women actually decide
    whether or not to become a mother. There's nothing cavalier or casual about most
    women's decision to have an abortion, nor are most women thinking about their
    \"rights\" when they make this decision. The women Cannold interviewed felt responsibility
    to and for the fetus they carried, but were convinced abortion was sometimes the
    most moral action they could take. Cannold argues that feminists must abandon
    the sterile rhetoric of rights, instead basing their defense of abortion rights
    on the nuanced, practical calculus women actually apply in making these moral
    decisions.\n\n[Mary Carroll, Booklist, Copyright American Library Association.

    read over a weekend, this book would be an appropriate addition to a women's studies
    class where issues of reproduction are discussed in depth. Undergraduate and graduate
