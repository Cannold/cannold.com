    Tuesday is the moment of truth. Thatâ\x80\x99s because Tuesday is the day\r\nthe
    Coalition party room meets to discuss whether they will support or\r\noppose a
    promised Democratâ\x80\x99s amendment to the Therapeutic Goods Act that\r\nwill
    lift what has effectively been a ban on the â\x80\x9Cabortion pillâ\x80\x9D in\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nThe
    Prime Minister has hinted that he will offer his colleagues a\r\nconscience vote
    on the issue. This is the route Federal Labour has\r\nalready adopted to deal
    with longstanding and trenchant internal\r\ndivisions in the party around womenâ\x80\x99s
    reproductive freedom.\r\n\r\nBut a conscience vote sends all the wrong messages
    to Parliamentarians\r\nand to the electorate about the nature of the vote on RU
    486. It asserts\r\nthat the vote is about the moral or legal legitimacy of abortion.
    Yet\r\nthis could not be further from the truth. In reality, this is a vote\r\nabout
    the integrity of Australiaâ\x80\x99s framework for ensuing the quality,\r\nsafety
    and efficacy of the medicines we ingest and give to our children.\r\nIt is a vote
    about whether or not the TGA, or the Health Minister, ought\r\nto be making critical
    decision about which pharmaceuticals are made\r\navailable to Australian patients,
    and in what circumstances.\r\n\r\nTo understand why, a short history of the offending
    amendments is\r\nnecessary. Passed in 1996 with the agreement of both major parties,
    the\r\namendments were designed by their author - anti-choice Senator Harradine\r\n-
    to forever deny Australian women access to RU 486 and any other\r\npharmaceutical
    capable of inducing a non-surgical abortion. Having made\r\nthe specious claim
    that the rigorous quality, safety and efficacy\r\nanalysis the TGA does for all
    pharmaceuticals entering Australia was\r\ninadequate for these drugs - and these
    drugs alone - the Harradine\r\namendments require the Health Minister to approve
    in writing the\r\nimportation, trial, registration or listing of such drugs, and
    to table\r\nthat approval in parliament. In exchange for this warped\r\ndream-come-true,
    Senator Harradine horse-traded his vote to privatise\r\nTelstra.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    the droverâ\x80\x99s dog could work out that the Harradine amendments\r\nvirtually
    guaranteed that no company would attempt to market the drug in\r\nAustralia. Registering
    drugs with the TGA is time-consuming and\r\nexpensive. No manufacturer with any
    sense would bankroll it knowing that\r\neven if they successfully demonstrate
    that the drug is both safe and\r\neffective the Health Minister could still -
    without even needing to\r\nexplain why - refuse to permit Australian patients
    to access it.\r\n\r\nThe contempt both political parties showed for Australian
    women and\r\npatients in passing the Harradine amendments - and continue to\r\ndemonstrate
    by refusing to join hands to remove them - is breathtaking.\r\nRU486 is used in
    the treatment of life-threatening conditions like\r\nCushings Syndrome, inoperable
    brain tumours, HIV/AIDS, ovarian and some\r\nbreast cancers. Yet, by and large,
    Australians with such\r\nlife-threatening conditions miss out or are forced to
    cope with\r\nintolerable delays. The hypocrisy of anti-choice players in this
    drama\r\nalso deserves mention. Mifepristone enables women to abort very early
    in\r\npregnancy - indeed, the moment they know they are pregnant while six\r\nweeks
    is the earliest a woman can have a surgical abortion. However,\r\ndespite opponents
    of choice expressing particular concern about the\r\nâ\x80\x9Ctragedyâ\x80\x9D
    of â\x80\x9Clateâ\x80\x9D abortions, they have worked tirelessly since 1998 to\r\neffectively
    ban Mifepristone, and to keep it banned.\r\n\r\nIn a strange way, the anti-choice
    Health Ministerâ\x80\x99s unprofessional\r\nbehaviour in commissioning the Chief
    Medical Officer to provide what\r\nLiberal colleague Mal Washer called â\x80\x9Clightweightâ\x80\x9D
    answers to â\x80\x9Cstupid\r\nquestionsâ\x80\x9D about the drugâ\x80\x99s safety
    has exposed the way the Harradine\r\namendments twist the proper, impartial, evidence-based
    processes that\r\nParliament - through the TGA - put in place to ensure Australians
    gained\r\ntimely access to good pharmaceuticals and were protected from the bad.\r\nTony
    Abbottsâ\x80\x99s behaviour, in other words, has clearly demonstrated why\r\nproperly
    resourced experts on the basis of the evidence, not a single\r\nindividual with
    an axe to grind, should rule on what drugs should be\r\nmade available to Australian
    patients.\r\n\r\nThe right thing for the Government, and the Opposition to do,
    would be\r\nto admit the terrible mistake they made close to a decade ago in backing\r\nthe
    Harradine amendments, and make amends to those injured by their\r\nexpedient mistake
    by voting together - along party lines - to remove\r\nthem from the TGA.\r\n\r\nThere

    suggest there shouldnâ\x80\x99t be one to remove them either."
